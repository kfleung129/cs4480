We want every moment with Kaja to be a feel-good experience \u2013 from whimsical packaging with playful components to unexpected textures in fun formats.\" At launch, the brand will have 47 products for complexion, eyes, and lips, offering exclusive formulations and first-to-market innovation. The Kaja partnership with Sephora is a first for Memebox and a major milestone for the global company. \"Sephora is a company that continually forecasts the future of beauty, so we are incredibly fortunate to collaborate with such a talented, best-in-class team,\" says Ha. \"Both of our teams focused on our respective expertise to ensure we developed something special based on the needs of beauty lovers and what's most meaningful to them.\" With so many brands in the prestige color space, Memebox offers a new perspective with an advanced digital expertise and trend forecasting power. Memebox is home to more than five million active users within their beauty community, engaging directly with them to understand market needs and develop high-quality, of-the-moment products. It is this point of difference which captured Sephora's attention and provided an opportunity to partner on the next color cosmetics disruptor, Kaja. \"At Sephora, we take great pride in cultivating new beauty experiences for our clients,\" says Alison Hahn, Senior Vice President of Merchandising for Sephora. \"Memebox and Sephora had a natural partnership with very similar traits; we're restless with a desire to lead trends and champion innovation with a cadre of beauty fans that give us real-time feedback. With that, we leveraged the best of our collective talents to create a truly unique color cosmetics collection featuring amazing new textures and formulas never seen or felt before.\" Kaja is available starting September 18, 2018, on Sephora.com.
