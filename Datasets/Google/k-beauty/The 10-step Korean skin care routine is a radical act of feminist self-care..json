    "text": "Screenshot via Sephora I first heard of what\u2019s known as the 10-step Korean skin care routine when my colleague Dorothy Kim, a professor of medieval literature at Vassar College, sent me a stack of peculiar-looking sheet masks along with some baby clothes her son had grown out of. \u201cWhat the hell are these?\u201d I asked. \u201cI mean, thank you.\u201d The packets\u2014with names like Bling Bling Hydro Gel Mask and Ferment Snail\u2014were, as Kim explained, the \u201cgateway\u201d product into a complex and time-intensive beauty regimen that South Korean women have been practicing religiously for years. \u201cThey make you look like a serial killer,\u201d Kim warned, \u201cbut they\u2019re ultra-moisturizing, and you can wear one while you\u2019re breastfeeding!\u201d So, whenever I happen to find 15 luxurious minutes to myself, I slapped one on. The change to my skin was instantaneous: My face felt more elastic, firmer, smoother, like it could breathe. It was as if I\u2019d been a Korean beauty\u2014or K-beauty\u2014devotee my entire life but just hadn\u2019t realized it until I was properly moisturized. Once I admitted to Kim that I enjoyed \u201cmasking,\u201d that was it. In the next box of baby stuff came a dozen different vials of goop, all of which had to be applied (and sometimes un-applied) in a precise order. Not one, but two cleansers\u2014and the first, an oil \u201ccleanser,\u201d felt so wrong to someone raised on the tingle of Noxzema\u2014followed by a \u201ctoner\u201d that felt nothing like Sea Breeze; then an \u201cessence,\u201d a thin goop of something that I still haven\u2019t figured out; thereinafter, a serum that is basically an even gloppier essence; then the serial-killer mask; followed by an eye cream\u2014and, at long last, multiple \u201cemulsions,\u201d or moisturizers. (Read a legitimate rundown of the routine here. It\u2019s not always 10 steps. Sometimes it\u2019s more.) My visage had taken a beating from pregnancy and then another from the abject neglect resulting from new motherhood; now, it was honest-to-goodness \u201cdewy.\u201d I started looking askance at friends who \u201conly\u201d used a cleanser and moisturizer. I wondered why K-beauty wasn\u2019t already a massive stateside trend\u2014and then I stopped wondering, because it is a massive Stateside trend, and has been for a while. (The only reason I didn\u2019t realize this is that I am a decrepit loser, who until very recently thought I could use the phrase Netflix and chill to describe binge-watching Making a Murderer while the baby napped in my arms.) You can buy three-packs of sheet masks imported directly from Seoul at Rite Aid. The Sephora website has an entire K-beauty section. Birchbox now regularly includes Korean products in their monthly subscription boxes and recently launched a K-beauty specialty box. Charlotte Cho, one of the beauty pioneers credited with popularizing K-beauty in the U.S., writes a column for Elle. What I didn\u2019t realize until recently, however, is that K-beauty is also popular with self-identified feminist academics and scholars, several of whom told me that they view the elaborate routine not as vanity but rather as an act of radical feminist self-care.* Indeed, Stockton University English and digital humanities professor and Web designer Adeline Koh published an entire blog post on the subject. She wrote: I\u2019ve started to view beauty as a form of self-care, instead of a patriarchal trap. One of my deepest inspirations, the writer and activist Audre Lorde,\u00a0famously declared that \u201cCaring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare.\u201d For many women, especially women of color, we\u2019re often told that we are only useful, only valuable\u00a0when we devote ourselves to others; that caring for ourselves in the last thing that we should consider. Kim agrees. \u201cSelf-care, especially for a woman of color, is radical,\u201d she tells me. Korean beauty \u201cis a little breath of relaxing joy and feminist community.\u201d She explains that this may also stem from the centuries-old tradition of spa and self-care in Korean culture. Kim emphasizes that \u201cthe Korean spa is also primarily about relaxing with other women and hanging out, rather than just \u2018go to the spa, get these things done to you, leave.\u2019 It\u2019s frequently a family affair. I remember going to the Korean spa with my cousins and aunts in Korea when I used to visit.\u201d Indeed, for many of the women I interviewed, the Korean routine is not merely about results (although they are certainly happy about the results). Instead, similar to the Korean spa experience itself, it\u2019s also about the ritual: the precise order of layering; the time necessary to let essence or serum penetrate before the next product can be applied; the special patting motion for the eye cream, etc. This particular form of self-care can be empowering for women (such as myself!) who are well outside of the age range considered sexually attractive (at least by DiCaprio standards). Katharine Jager, a medievalist and mother of twins, tells me, \u201cThe world is not kind to middle-aged women who are mothers, even if we are highly educated college professors. So we had better take care of ourselves.\u201d Indeed, thanks to the routine\u2019s emphasis on ritual and patience, says Jager, she not only has beautiful skin; she also has \u201cless tolerance for bullshit\u201d all around. (And to think, sheet masks are usually less than $3.) I can\u2019t speak for Jager\u2019s personal \u201cbullshit\u201d factor, but I can verify that, in my experience at least, female academics often walk a very peculiar line in The Profession. Despite being surrounded by allegedly forward-thinking individuals, they are still expected to look \u201cpolished and presentable,\u201d as Kim puts it, and \u201cyet never discuss the time and effort it requires to be so.\u201d This is especially true on the ever-fraught job market, on which Koh (who has tenure and thus navigated it successfully), quips that \u201cfemale candidates are often encouraged to look as asexual as possible to be \u2018hireable.\u2019 \u201d But also polished. But not too polished. Simple, right? Part of why K-beauty in particular seems to have trended in academia is that it\u2019s gentler and often less expensive than the other methods popular in the U.S.\u2014bizarre vibrating-brush contraptions; facials; shoving needles into ourselves. But another reason is that the K-beauty routine can be blended fairly seamlessly with a solitary, writing-intensive profession. More than one scholar I interviewed reported dividing writing or grading goals into mask units. Several plan to incorporate group masking into informal meetings at this weekend\u2019s Modern Languages Association conference (which makes the whole experience sound a tad less odious). It even intersects with some scholarship\u2014for example, Koh\u2019s current book project, which is \u201ca comparative study of representations of whiteness in different parts of the world.\u201d Skin care trends fit into this research, she says, \u201despecially in terms of the more problematic issues of race and colorism.\u201d For example, \u201cKorean beauty products often sell themselves as \u2018whitening,\u2019 which makes people in the U.S. think that they are bleaching their skin. The ingredients they use are never very extreme,\u201d she assures me, \u201cbut they do even one\u2019s skin tone, eventually making one fairer. American products use the same ingredients but sell them using completely different language.\u201d This makes for some awkward translations, though\u2014such as the Korean brand with a product called White Power Essence. \u201cAmerican users pointed out the racial dynamics here, and the company is reconsidering the name,\u201d she says. At the moment, Koh is on sabbatical, and she\u2019s moved on from research to praxis. She started formulating her own Korean-inspired skin care products because she found that commercial products sometimes irritated her skin, and she found the actual presence of much-touted active ingredients (like the decidedly not-vegan snail mucin or donkey milk) to be too small. She treated the formulation of her own products like another research project, studying cosmetic science textbooks and testing all products on herself (!). \u201cI\u2019m actually making something physical, which is quite different from my academic work where I work on ideas,\u201d she says. Once her friends started seeing her skin, they pulled a Newman\u2019s Own on her and demanded some for themselves\u2014so now she\u2019s gone commercial. Her company, the aptly-named Sabbatical Beauty, regularly sells out of products with highbrow referential names like Dorian Gray\u2019s Anti-Aging Serum. (I can only hope there\u2019s also a Painting in the Attic Pro-Aging concoction as well.) While the \u201cradical self-care\u201d of K-beauty may just seem like an interesting hobby these academics have picked up\u2014and the ensuing \u201ccommunity of feminist scholars,\u201d as musicology professor Elizabeth Randell Upton put it, merely a pleasant side effect\u2014 it may also have serious positive effects in a profession with sometimes startlingly high rates of depression. Beauty blogger Jude Chao, for example, writes here about how her own experience with K-beauty helped her fight depression; she is delighted with the results on her skin, yes, but also lauds the routine\u2019s ability to ground her in her skin, her body, \u201cand\u2014not to get too New Age-y\u2014the present.\u201d The present, she says, is what depression \u201csnatches\u201d from her; it \u201cmakes all the days blend together.\u201d The Korean skin care ritual, she says, \u201cgives the present back to me twice a day, every day.\u201d So if you\u2019re a college student and you happen to surprise your ethics professor in her office and she\u2019s decked out like Jason, don\u2019t be alarmed\u2014and don\u2019t dismiss her as vain. She\u2019s engaged in a political act of self-care and/or unwinding from the day\u2019s \u201cbullshit.\u201d She might even be keeping her mental health intact while giving your latest essay precisely the correct amount of grading time. *Correction, Jan. 7, 2015:\u00a0This article originally misidentified the bloggers Tracy of fanserviced-b and Cat Cactus of Snow White and the Asian Pear as \u201cself-identified feminist academics and scholars.\u201d Neither blogger self-identifies as a feminist, and Cat Cactus is not an academic. The piece also stated that Tracy and Cat Cactus are among women who \u201cview the elaborate [K-beauty] routine not as vanity but rather as an act of radical feminist self-care.\u201d Both bloggers disavow this view, and neither of them were contacted for the piece.
