    "text": "Submit \u0394 Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. A Jamaican-born beauty is accusing Donald Trump\u2019s modeling agency of breaking federal immigration laws and stiffing her out of more than $200,000 in salary \u2013 by docking wages for dermatologist bills, walking lessons, limo rides and other \u201crequired\u201d expenses. Alexia Palmer, 21, of St. Albans, Queens, slapped Trump Model Management, its president Corinne Nicolas and other company honchos with a class-action lawsuit Thursday in Manhattan federal court accusing the modeling giant of racketeering, breach of contract, mail fraud and violating wage laws for immigrants. The suit seeks back pay and other money damages on behalf of Palmer and, potentially, other models. The stunning 5-foot 10-inch Palmer \u2013 who has posed for Chanel, Teen Vogue and other top clients \u2013 claims in the suit that Trump\u2019s company lied to the federal government by documenting on her work-visa application that she\u2019d be paid a yearly $75,000 salary while living in the United States. Instead, Palmer worked exclusively for Trump from 2011 through 2013 and only received a total of $3,880 in pay over the three years after the agency deducted a 20 percent handling fee and various \u201cinsignificant expenses,\u201d the suit says. \u201c[Palmer] was \u2026 charged for postage and makeup kits [and] was sent to a dermatologist upon the defendants\u2019 recommendation,\u201d the suit says. \u201cShe was asked to take walking lessons, constantly supplied with numerous unnecessary cosmetics kits, and made to take expensive limousines, all at [her] expense,\u201d the suit says. Palmer claims she only moved to the US after being promised a guaranteed salary. Her lawyer, Naresh Gehi, told The Post, the model\u2019s rights were \u201cmiserably violated.\u201d \u201cMy client should be paid what she was promised,\u201d said Gehi. But Trump Organization EVP and general counsel Alan Garten called Palmer\u2019s claims \u201cfrivolous and bogus.\u201d He said the expense deductions are \u201cstandard\u201d and that the $75,000 figure was an \u201cestimate\u201d \u2014 and not part of any binding employment contract. \u201cWe\u2019re a modeling agency \u2013 not an employment agency \u2013 so had she been more successful as a model, she would have made more money,\u201d Garten said. Palmer was reportedly discovered as a high school teen in 2010 when she placed second in Liverpool-based modeling titan Pulse\u2019s 2010 \u201cCaribbean Model Search.\u201d Her images were soon featured throughout London promoting top cosmetic lines, and she scored a shoot for Teen Vogue with members of the cast of the TV hit \u201cGlee.\u201d Founded by The Donald in 1999, Trump Model Management is among Manhattan\u2019s elite modeling agencies. It\u2019s stable of current and former A-list models include Carol Alt, Kim Alexis and former Miss Universe and Miss USA Olivia Culpo. Trump is not individually named as a defendant in the suit. ",
