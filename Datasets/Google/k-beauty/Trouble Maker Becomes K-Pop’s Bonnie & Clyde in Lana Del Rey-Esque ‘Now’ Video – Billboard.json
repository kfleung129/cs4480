By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJeff Benjamin Those familiar with K-pop music videos and hoping to find a glossy, colorful, sugary-sweet visual from\u00a0Trouble Maker \u2014 the duo project of\u00a04minute rapper/\u201dGangnam Style\u201d star HyunA and\u00a0Beast vocalist Hyunseung \u2014 may be disappointed with \u201cNow.\u201d The video for the duo\u2019s latest single appears to be heavily influenced by a modern-day, badass Bonnie and Clyde storyline that pop fans have come to expect from an artist like Lana Del Rey or Rihanna.

It has already given South Korea\u2019s \u201c19+\u201d rating, labeling it as only appropriate for those older than 19 \u2014 the equivalent of Rated R in America.  Despite the warning, the video has received more than 3.6 million views a day after its Oct. 27 reveal.  \u201cNow\u201d shows the two K-pop idols engaging in very un-idol-like behavior: smoking cigarettes, drinking beer, there\u2019s even an implied threesome with Hyunseung. Still, it\u2019s the type of shock tactics that American pop fans have become indifferent to. Trouble Maker\u2019s \u201cNow\u201d feels like a concentrated effort to get Western attention. There is loads of imagery familiar to American audiences from Budweiser and Heineken beer bottles to a scene where Hyunseung sports the Joker makeup Heath Ledger donned in \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d film. While HyunA looks completely different than she did in the\u00a0\u201cGangnam Style\u201d or \u00a0\u201cOppa Is Just My Style\u201d\u00a0videos (with 1.8 billion and 423 million views respectively), her sex appeal is upped with revealing clothing along with an edgy, blonde hairdo. Earlier this year, HyunA told Billboard that \u201cpositive ideas are being discussed\u201d for a proper U.S. debut for the 21-year-old. While \u201cNow\u201d is sure to shake up the K-Pop Hot 100 these coming weeks, this Trouble Maker promotion feels like a well-calculated step to help garner more attention for HyunA to break into the Western mainstream \u2014 while her labelmate Hyunseung reaps the benefits, putting him and Beast in better position for pop penetration.
