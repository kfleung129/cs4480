When blogger Karolina \u017bebrowska saw the numerous\u00a0viral 100 Years of Beauty and 100 Years of Fashion videos, she became a bit frustrated. \"It really bugged me how inaccurate some of these are,\" she wrote on her blog. \"The beauty standards they show are almost always our contemporary stereotypes of the past decades.\" So she made the\u00a0version she wanted to see: a more historically accurate one\u00a0that shows\u00a0the\u00a0looks real\u00a0women wore from the 1900s to 1940s.\u00a0The two-minute video doesn't shy away from\u00a0the darker parts of history. Just watch; it's thought-provoking: Alyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton). She previously held positions at InStyle and Cosmopolitan.
