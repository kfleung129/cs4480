    "text": "It smells like a moisturizer. It goes on like paste. It\u2019s been said to have anti-aging effects that stimulate skin elasticity, repairs damage and restores hydration. It\u2019s ... snail slime. Korean skin care products such as this are taking the internet by storm. Known as K-beauty, some of these products can seem pretty weird (bee venom is another popular phenomenon), but they\u2019re catching on in the United States. No, not every American woman uses carbonated masks or vacuuming for their pores. But that\u2019s quickly changing on the coasts. And the Twin Cities \u2014 specifically St. Paul \u2014 are slowly embracing the trend. Korean-Americans founded popular online boutiques such as Soko Glam and Peach & Lily, which offer arrays of products for all kinds of skin conditions. There\u2019s the Neogen Pore Refine Serum for blackheads. The Super Aqua Cell Renew Snail Cream for acne. The Yuja Water C Whitening Ampoule serum for pigmentation. And for curious Twin Cities residents who want to see the products in person, there\u2019s one go-to spot. At the Hmong Village mall in St. Paul, there\u2019s a small store called Happy Peach. It offers what is probably Minnesota\u2019s widest selection of South Korean beauty products: carbonated clay masks, cream made with egg yolk extract, bubble tea sleeping packs, aloe vera moisturizers and oil-based cleansers specifically for men.    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    ELIZABETH FLORES, Star Tribune\n                \n\n                                            Happy Peach stocks an array of K-beauty products such as this carbonated face mask. Owner Kha Vang started Happy Peach in 2015, promoting her products primarily via social media. She opened the permanent location at Hmong Village last year. A general interest in Korean culture and K-pop (aka Korean pop music) led Kha to discover K-beauty in 2014. After ordering some products online, she traveled to South Korea that very year to talk with brokers about bringing products to the States. She started with beauty brands that interested her personally, such as those from Etude House. She now visits South Korea once a year to bring back customer-requested products in addition to doing smaller monthly shipments. With more than 10 different brands in-store, Happy Peach manager Mai Vang (Kha\u2019s sister) said the selection continues to grow as K-beauty gains popularity. \u201cIt\u2019s honestly because everything is more natural and way cheaper,\u201d Mai said. \u201cOur customer base goes from teenagers to people who are 50 and want to look younger.\u201d Natural ingredients \u201cKorean skin care is not for the person who\u2019s like, \u2018I want to wash my face and go,\u2019\u2009\u201d said Minneapolis blogger and beauty expert Elizabeth Dehn. \u201cIt\u2019s for people that are really passionate about the skin care regimen, and meticulous.\u201d Minneapolis\u2019 Salon Rouge manager and makeup artist Jeffrey Dunn attributes K-beauty\u2019s popularity to its low prices, partly due to the South Korean government\u2019s subsidizing of the industry. \u201cIt\u2019s a really large export,\u201d said Dunn, who stocks a small selection of Korean facemasks at his salon. \u201cAnd they\u2019re innovative because they have some of the oldest recorded skin care recipes of any country.\u201d Dunn added that Korean skin care products use more natural ingredients to achieve hydrated, clear skin. While Americans tend toward drying treatments such as mud masks and exfoliating cleansers, Koreans load up on hyaluronic acid to pump water into their skin. And they favor fermented ingredients, which Dunn said are more stable and sustainable than moisture-sucking ingredients. At Happy Peach, where most of the clientele comes from the Twin Cities Hmong and Korean communities, the Vang sisters dole out K-beauty recommendations for all sorts of skin types, from dry to oily to acne-prone. But one of K-beauty\u2019s biggest virtues, they say, is the emphasis on different brands and products for varying ages. Etude House specializes in cleansers and toners for the \u201cyounger generation,\u201d said Mai, because their products go on lighter. She advises those 30 and older to try Missha products, moisturizers and serums that have heavier consistencies (and recently landed at Target). Also for more mature women, the snail solution cleanser and egg mellow cream is a way to soften the effects of aging, she said. \u201cMy skin has become a lot better since I started using these products in high school,\u201d customer Xania Nharav said. \u201cKorean beauty products do an excellent job at meeting my expectations in quality and appearance,\u201d customer Julie Lo said. \u201cAnd, of course, the packaging is cute.\u201d Nhia Vang of Wausau, Wis., occasionally comes to the Twin Cities and picks up \u201caffordable and effective\u201d products at Happy Peach. \u201cI\u2019ve never really taken care of my face up until three years ago, when I had bad acne and breakouts,\u201d she said. \u201cI started getting facials and bought all the prestigious skin care products that have been proven to work, yet I wasn\u2019t getting any results. Then a Korean sister showed me this peeling gel, and after two weeks, I noticed that my face was clearing up. That\u2019s when I went into a Korean skin care frenzy.\u201d Dehn swears by pore clearing sheet masks, which can have ingredients such as avocado, rice or even red wine. As the K-beauty industry continues to grow with \u201cwonderful, multi-tasking natural\u201d products, Dehn thinks curiosity in the West will continue to climb. \u201cWomen get bored of their beauty,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we are always looking for the next thing. I think we\u2019re just a more globally minded culture now, and that extends into beauty and fashion.\u201d \u00a9 2023 StarTribune. All rights reserved. ",
