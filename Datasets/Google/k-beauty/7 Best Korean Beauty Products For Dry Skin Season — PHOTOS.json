    "text": "Fashion  I'm a sucker for wintertime. The first mention of snowfall will throw me into a tizzy of excitement and send me searching for my collection of chunky sweaters. But I am always less excited about the flaky, dry skin that comes with cold weather. Fortunately, Korean beauty products for dry skin are a-plenty, and they can help us enjoy winter weather without the pain of chapped lips and windburned cheeks. As someone who's prone to drying out my skin, I can assure you that these babies will hydrate your dry skin all winter long. What makes these Korean moisturizers, cleansers, and creams stand out to me is their ability to moisturize without leaving greasy or heavy residue behind, since that kind of over-moisturizing can cause more damage than good. The secret to these products' efficacy arguably lies in their somewhat unfamiliar but really effective textures, like gel creams or oil mousses. These moisturizers will transform from solids to liquids, from creams to oils, and will make dead skin disappear even in the dead of winter. The names and descriptions of these products might sound a bit funky, or a little intimidating, but if you're looking for heavy moisturizers that won't go on too thick or leave your skin greasy, you can't do much better than them. Get ready to conquer wintertime dryness, once and for all. Nature Republic The First Sun Liquid SPF 50+ PA+++, $24, Amazon.com Cold weather doesn't mean you don't have to worry about sun damage. Every good skincare routine should include some kind of sunscreen, even when the weather outside is frightful. This one from Nature Republic is formulated to be more liquid and less cream, which allows it to absorb into skin quickly and leaves your face moisturized rather than oily. MISSHA Mild Essence Sun Milk , $22, Amazon If a sun liquid isn't your cup of tea, why not try some sun milk? This sunscreen from MISSHA is another lightweight formula that quickly soaks into skin and doesn't leave a white residue, despite what its dairy-inspired name might suggest. Use it underneath a heavier moisturizer or just on its own. T ONYMOLY Magic Food Banana Hand Milk , $10, Ulta What this \"hand milk\" from TONYMOLY lacks in an appealing name, it makes up for with its adorable fruit-shaped packaging. The banana scent will brighten up any cold winter day without smelling artificial or overwhelming, and the lotion will leave you with smooth hands that aren't greasy or slippery. Banila Co. Clean It Zero Purity , $20, Amazon For wintertime, it's particularly important to find a cleanser that will moisturize skin as it cleans. Enter this oil cleansing balm from Banila Co., which comes as a semi-solid cream but turns into a liquid cleansing oil when rubbed on skin. This gentle yet innovative formula will ensure that your makeup and any dirt from the day come off completely without stripping your skin of much-needed oils and moisture. There's also a version of this cleansing balm for oily or combination skin. Belif The True Cream Aqua Bomb , $18, Sephora Belif's The True Cream Aqua Bomb has something of a cult following for its ability to deeply moisturize skin without weighing it down due, in no small part, to its gel cream texture. Plus, belif is an all-natural K-beauty company, so you don't have to worry about any animal-origin ingredients or the addition of any fragrances or mineral oils in its products. Shara Shara Shaking Oil & Cream, $34, Amazon.com This moisturizer from Shara Shara kind of looks more like a jar that belongs in your pantry than in your bathroom counter, but even though this cream does include five different fruit oils, it's definitely meant for your face. The \"shaking\" part comes in because you literally shake the bottle to mix those oils \u2014 which include lemon and grape extracts \u2014 with the moisturizer, and then apply. The result is a lightly whipped cream that both hydrates and brightens skin. Too Cool For School Egg Mousse Body Oil , $25, Sephora Another transformative beauty product, this moisturizer from Too Cool For School starts off as a mousse but, once applied, turns into a nourishing body oil. The fast-absorbing formula is perfect for anyone who likes the texture of oils but doesn't enjoy waiting around for them to properly and fully soak into skin. The egg in this mousse, according to Sephora, helps with skin's ability to regenerate cells. Say good riddance to dry skin this winter, and embrace the transformational power of K-beauty products.
