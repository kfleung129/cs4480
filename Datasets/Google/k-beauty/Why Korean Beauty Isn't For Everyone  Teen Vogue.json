    "title": "Why Korean Beauty Isn't For Everyone | Teen Vogue",
    "text": "By Krithika Varagur Korean skincare is less a market niche than an apothecary of specialized products for every imaginable skin problem, condition, or aspiration: redness, dryness, a pearlescent glow. It became a global phenomenon partly in reaction to our Western fixation with cure-all and all-natural products. Korean makeup, on the other hand, is the Brandy Melville of the beauty world, in its conviction that \u201cone size fits most.\u201d Within high-tech Korean cosmetics like cushion compacts and BB/CC creams, there are routinely few to no options for girls with darker skin. The \u201cSignature Essence Cushion\u201d from Missha, for instance, comes in two colors: light beige and natural beige. (And if the \u201cnatural beige\u201d girl tans\u2026?) Admittedly, this is likely not a problem in its country of origin, where most women are ethnic Koreans whose skin tones are served best by those varying shades of beige. But if K-beauty is shooting for a global market, shouldn't it address people of color better than it does currently? \u201cIn the Western world, 60-70% of Korean beauty consumers are non-Asian,\u201d Charlotte Cho, founder of e-commerce site Soko Glam tells Teen Vogue. She said that current product offerings for darker-skinned women are limited because \u201cup until last year, the primary focus of Korean cosmetics companies has been on the Asian market, where there aren't a wide range of skin tones.\u201d Cho cited Amore Pacific and Missha as \u201cestablished\u201d brands with relatively more color options. But Missha\u2019s \u201cPerfect Cover\u201d BB cream comes in five shades, all variations on \u201cbeige.\u201d AmorePacific\u2019s tinted moisturizer comes in four, ending at \u201cMedium,\u201d which was still too light for me in dead winter. It\u2019s frustrating for darker-skinned girls to be shut out of products that seems to inspire religious fealty. It\u2019s almost a throwback to the beauty landscape of just a decade past, when high-end makeup brands like Chanel and YSL could afford to cut off their cosmetics around the \u201colive\u201d mark. Maybe \u201cafford\u201d is the key word here: if it\u2019s profitable for Korean brands to keep making just a few shades, why would they change? In the past, beauty industry change has happened through a combination of cultural outcry and basic economics. If Korean cosmetics do expand their range, they will likely find eager consumers with outsize purchasing power. Black women spend $7.5 billion on beauty products every year, for example, and 80% more on cosmetics than other consumers. But companies mostly learn about the demand for certain products when their customers speak out. Alicia Yoon, founder of the Korean beauty e-commerce site Peach and Lily, says as much: \u201cWhen I speak to Korean beauty brands, they are aware of this market, and say they are looking to expand once the demand grows large enough,\u201d she tells Teen Vogue. The consumer demand for more diverse Korean products has been muted so far, save for a handful of beauty bloggers. And not just because the Korean beauty market is so new. Women may hesitate to speak out because of the fact that these products aren\u2019t from America, where diversity is almost a cultural mandate, but from a foreign country and culture. Maybe this is just \u201cthe way things are,\u201d and the way these products will be. This line of thought is a mistake. It\u2019s unlikely that we would accept it if, say, Nars offered a foundation just in four \u201cbeige\u201d tones. We should hold Korean companies who sell to Americans by the same standard. Diversity in makeup doesn\u2019t even have to be a racially loaded proposition. The supermodel Iman, whose makeup company was one of the first to serve dark-skinned women, uses the term \u201cwomen with skin of color\u201d instead of \u201cwomen of color\u201d to emphasize that women have more in common as one consumer group than they do in separate buckets: some \u201chave darker complexions and that\u2019s it\u201d (as writer Elizabeth Sevran put it). By this logic, providing darker makeup options is simply a supply-demand issue, not one of cultural shaming. Yoon says she\u2019s already having conversations with the brands she stocks at Peach & Lily to offer more skin tones for her American consumers. \u201cThe timing will be all about how quickly the market demand grows \u2014 once it\u2019s big enough, I believe the products will be available,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the meantime, other makeup products like eyeliners, mascara, eyeshadows, blushes, and lip products can be great for everyone, regardless of skin tone,\u201d said Yoon. This is half true. In reality, even color cosmetics like lipstick and blush usually have to be formulated differently for dark-skinned women: more pigmented, and with options for warm or cool undertones. This is why a product like MAC\u2019s best-selling Studio Fix foundation comes in 37 shades. (that doesn\u2019t make the point about lipsticks and blush) By Lexi McMenamin By Sara Delgado By Anjana Pawa Expanding their target audience will be no small task for Korean cosmetics companies. The overhaul may take a while, especially given the exacting formulations for which they\u2019re known. In the meantime, we\u2019ll try to figure out what essence really is.
