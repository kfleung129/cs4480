    "text": "By Sarah Wu We\u2019ve long suspected that K-beauty products actually come to us in a time machine from the future. The ahead-of-the-trend skincare, makeup, and haircare is like nothing else we already own, and the innovations just keep coming. If you live Stateside, chances are you know about popular sites like Peach & Lily or Soko Glam. But today, Nordstrom just made things more accessible than ever by introducing their major K-beauty collab, and you\u2019re going to want to shop it, stat. Pop-In@Nordstrom is introducing 500 products (including some being sold in the U.S. for the very first time) for the next seven weeks \u2014 both in select stores and online at nordstrom.com/POP. The brands include popular names like Too Cool for School and Glow Recipe, as well as ones we\u2019ve never heard of (like I Woke Up Like This, A\u2019Pieu, and Onnu). We won\u2019t even attempt to narrow down the sea of launches to a top-10 list, but if you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, try starting with a gemstoe soap or pumpkin sleeping mask. If you\u2019re lucky enough to live near one of the pop-in shops (find the full list here), you\u2019ll be able to browse the hydrating jelly eyeshadows and 24-karat gold swabs (yes, they do exist) in-person. And don\u2019t worry \u2014 you can\u2019t miss the stores. Just let the pink and blue gel walls, fuzzy yoga balls, and neon pink sign guide you to a better beauty collection.
