Often surrounded by a bevy of female dancers, G-Dragon greets screaming teenage audiences in token rapper style, showing off arm tattoos, garish earrings, and hair colors that vary from beach blond to bright pink. But it\u2019s G-Dragon\u2019s other trademark that has the cosmetic industry taking notice: He\u2019s an ostentatious applier of makeup. And forget about the fringe gender-bending realm of 1980s pop stars like Boy George and David Bowie. The massive popularity of K-pop is fueling mainstream emulation. The result: South Korea is home to a booming market for male beauty products. Of course, male makeup sales pale next to the market for women, and only a minority of Korean men apply a raft of products such as \u201cBB Cream\u201d on a daily basis. Last year, South Korean men spent $635 million on whiteners, lotions and skin creams \u2014 second only to China, according to research firm Euromonitor, in a region that makes up about two-thirds of global spending in this $3.3 billion market. \u201cThe market for male cosmetics has definitely been expanded in the last couple of years,\u201d said Kim Tae-young, a make-up artist at an Olive Young branch in Hongdae, an indie nightlife district in Seoul. \u201cThings are very different from the past, when cosmetics were associated exclusively with women,\u201d she said. \u201cI get the feeling that there is a lot less self-consciousness about those gender divisions among our customers these days.\u201d Even then, wouldn\u2019t the average dude shun this trend for being \u201cfeminine?\u201d Not exactly, according to enthusiastic cosmetic artists and their male customers interviewed by GlobalPost. Legions of K-pop fans adore G-Dragon and his peers. So much that swarms of men want to be them, they say. That\u2019s because, staying true to the masculine roots of gangster rap, G-Dragon has managed to inject what fans call an iconic flair into his thick eyeliner and lipstick, wowing the throngs of starry-eyed young females who swear allegiance to K-pop. At beauty school and through YouTube tutorials, male fashionistas inquisitively study and apply these K-pop influenced beauty masks and gels. Many take cue from G-Dragon\u2019s advertisements for deep red lipstick \u2014 and a host of other endorsements for gels and lotions by the well-paid men of K-pop. Trickling down to the mass market, most makeup-wearing men aren\u2019t so flamboyant, simply choosing to brush up every morning with hints of whitener and eyeliner. \u201cMy supervisor encourages it, to appear nice for our customers,\u201d explains Park Jae-hyeon, 28, a banker wearing subtle eyeliner. \u201cThis is the 21st century. Men need to look good too.\u201d It\u2019s the younger guys, who don\u2019t have to worry about their professional appearance, who have the luxury of sticking out with more extreme looks. That\u2019s why students and recent graduates are \u201cfollowing what they see on TV,\u201d said Kim Tae-young of the Olive Young store, looking up to their favorite idols and celebrities.
