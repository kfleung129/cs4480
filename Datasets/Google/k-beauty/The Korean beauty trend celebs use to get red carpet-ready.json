Now that buzzed-about multistep Korean skin-care regimens have taken hold in the US, it\u2019s time to take our resulting radiant complexions to the next level with the next big trend straight from Seoul: whisper-thin treatment foundation contained in a springy \u201ccushion\u201d sponge compact. Dabbed on with a puff applicator, it delivers a gorgeous glow. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a second skin,\u201d raves Sir John Barnett, celebrity makeup artist for L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris, who\u2019s been patting the brand\u2019s new True Match Lumi Cushion makeup on red-carpet clients like Beyonc\u00e9 and Karlie Kloss. \u201cI call it an \u2018invisible\u2019 finish.\u201d Indeed, it lent a flawless characteristic to Naomi Watts and Jennifer Lopez during awards show season. Think of cushion foundations as portable liquid that combine the ease of a powder compact with the effect of barely-there base. As long as the lid\u00a0is clamped tight, a foundation-drenched sponge stays wet. They\u2019re pretty ingenious. While there are plenty of new American and French offerings hitting the market, there\u2019s no question where this next-gen foundation type got its start. \u201cKoreans typically aim to achieve a soft, dewy, luminous complexion, and the focus is really on the skin,\u201d says Charlotte Cho, the founder of Soko Glam, a K-beauty e-tailer. \u201cThat\u2019s why they created the cushion compact. It\u2019s considered a fusion of skin care and makeup because it doesn\u2019t\u00a0just cover, it also improves the look, feel and health of the skin with its anti-aging, brightening and moisturizing effects.\u201d Jersey City-based IT Cosmetics got the skin care-meets-makeup memo. Its new CC+ Veil Beauty Fluid Foundation not only boasts sun-safe SPF 50, it\u2019s also laced with a slew of vitamins, peptides and complexion-plumping hyaluronic acid. Portable hydration is the key selling point for Givenchy\u2019s chic Teint Couture Cushion. And MAC Cosmetics\u2019 Matchmaster Shade Intelligence Compact, offered in 12 hues, dispenses product in a microfine layer for a \u201cyou, but better\u201d look. The smart-cushion technology has even been used in a complexion product that\u2019s layered beneath foundation. Lanc\u00f4me\u2019s new Miracle CC Cushion Color Correcting Primers, in pinky peach, purple, yellow and green, are designed to spot-correct, neutralize redness, and boost radiance. K-beauty guru Alicia Yoon handpicks and stocks an array of Korean cushions on her Peach & Lily site, including Hera\u2019s popular UV Mist Cushion. \u201cThat\u2019s the one every Korean stewardess I speak to uses,\u201d she notes. \u201cWhich says a lot, considering they stay flawless throughout an entire 14-hour flight.\u201d ",
