With a K-pop obsession and love for traveling to South Korea, Chinese consumers\u2019 demand for Korean products is creating big competition for Western brands in the areas of beauty and fashion. Korean cosmetics exports to China\u00a0surged 250 percent\u00a0last year, and accounted for almost one-fourth of all of China\u2019s imported cosmetics. This has caused a decline in Western brands\u2019 market share of foreign beauty products in China, which decreased by 4.8 percent for skincare and 3.8 percent for color cosmetics in 2014. In addition, Korean fashion labels are becoming big business in China\u2014Lane Crawford offers several Korean menswear brands like Woo Young Mi and is planning to start stocking Korean womenswear, according to a\u00a0Reuters report. The ability to leverage Korean celebrities and TV shows\u2014which are massively popular in China\u2014has been one of the major reasons cosmetics brands have been able to surge ahead, according to a recent report on Korean beauty brands in China by L2. For example, Lane\u00edge has been launching promotions with spokesmodel and Korean drama star Song Hye Ko since 2008, and recently saw a significant sales boost for a lip product that was featured in the show in which she stars. Meanwhile, Innisfree, one of the most popular Korean beauty brands in China, had a wildly successful \u201cSummer Love\u201d campaign in 2015 featuring Korean influencers Lee Minho and Yoona that saw an average of 181,000 views per video on Youku. While Korean celebrities are also frequently used by Western brands for marketing in China, L2 finds that Korean brands also have an edge in the tech arena. According to the report, Innissfree is the most-searched beauty brand on Baidu, coming in ahead of all French brands thanks not only to its viral celebrity-filled campaigns but also to its focus on technological development. For example, the brand offers a gamified omnichannel loyalty program as well as e-commerce through both Tmall and a standalone site that allows users to sign in through Weibo, QQ, or Alipay. Meanwhile, Lane\u00edge is the dominant beauty brand on Weibo, with more average monthly mentions than any other beauty brand. There are several key things Western brands can learn from Korean success stories, according to the report. First, when searching for KOLs to influence the China market, don\u2019t forget to expand beyond China and leverage the influence of Korean star power. In addition, brands can look to build their presence on e-commerce sites that are \u201cprioritizing popular Korean brands.\u201d Product selection is key as well, with the need for Western brands to provide more \u201cinnovative, competitively priced products targeting Asian-specific consumer needs,\u201d especially when it comes to beauty.
