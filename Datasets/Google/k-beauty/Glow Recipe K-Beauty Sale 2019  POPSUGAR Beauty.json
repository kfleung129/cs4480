    "text": "Updated on 6/12/2019 at 8:35 AM Glow Recipe put the latest and greatest in K-beauty at our fingertips. Now, those beauty products are available at a massive discount. The retailer has just kicked off its \"Glow All Out\" Sale, where you can get products from its curated list of brands at a 40 to 60 percent discount from now until June 30. It's time to stock up on sheet masks, essences, serums, and the rest of your skincare favorites. There's a reason behind the sale. It comes on the heels of Glow Recipe's decision to focus on its own brand by the same name. Which means you have to act fast, as the curated products won't be available on the retailer's website starting in July. See our picks for the best products that have been discounted, along with our favorite Glow Recipe-brand skincare items, ahead.
