Glass and dolphin skin trends are all about making skin luminous and shiny; the brighter, the better. But not cloud skin. In fact, it takes the opposite route for makeup products applied to look radiant from within instead. From the outside, skin has a soft focus, almost blurred-like appearance. A post shared by Nina Park (@ninapark) The best part is cloud skin is actually incredibly easy to try and perfect if you've grown weary of luminous makeup and possibly even run out of highlighter. Follow these beauty tips to get the cloud skin makeup look. Use a dewy makeup primer and foundation to give your skin radiance right from step one without making it look shiny. Mix a few drops of liquid highlighter with your foundation and then apply for a luminous look which is natural and not at all excessive. Do not apply any other form of highlighter post this step. Choose cream products and tints to further enhance the naturally radiant makeup look that is fresh, bright and seamless. Disclaimer: The Swirlster Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.
