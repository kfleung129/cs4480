    "text": "Creators of Skin Deep Database Tapwater Database EWG Verified The New LedeSearch WASHINGTON \u2013 A new EWG analysis of serums and essences, popularized by Korean beauty, or K-Beauty, finds that about 40 percent of the products were formulated with less hazardous ingredients. U.S. sales of K-beauty products have increased by almost 300 percent in the past two years alone. EWG researchers analyzed 352 products in the Skin Deep\u00ae database from U.S., European, Korean and other Asian companies, looking at the hazards posed by the ingredients and the price point per fluid ounce. Skin Deep assesses products based on the hazards associated with their ingredients. Consumers often assume that more expensive skin care products are made with healthier ingredients. This is not always the case. Many of the green-scoring products we assessed cost less per fluid ounce than did products with worse scores. Some of the most expensive products \u2013 costing as much as $640 per fluid ounce \u2013 scored in the red range. \u201cWe analyzed the ingredients used to make the serums and essences based on their hazard scores in Skin Deep,\u201d said Kali Rauhe, an associate database analyst at EWG. \u201cSixty-six of the products met the strictest criteria for health and transparency, to earn the EWG VERIFIED\u2122 mark. Five of these EWG VERIFIED\u2122 products made our Best Bets list, meaning they are less hazardous for you and your wallet.\u201d EWG researchers found that companies can make a trendy personal care product that also meets the rigorous standards for health and transparency dictated by the EWG VERIFIED\u2122 program. \u201cWe wanted to highlight that product marketing, packaging and cost often have very little to do with the safety of the ingredients used in the product,\u201d said Nneka Leiba, director of EWG\u2019s healthy living science program. \u201cConsumers are drawn to the design and price point without realizing that the information on the front of the package is not vetted by the Food and Drug Administration, the agency governing personal care products. So a company can claim almost anything and use almost any ingredients without penalty because they\u2019re so poorly regulated.\u201d The ingredient \u201cfragrance\u201d was found in nearly half the products evaluated. Ingredients classified under this umbrella term can be made up of a mixture of more than 3000 chemicals, including endocrine-disrupting phthalates. EWG\u2019s assessment found some serums and essences also contained long-chain parabens, which have been linked to endocrine disruption as well. Endocrine disruptors often mimic hormones and disrupt the body\u2019s endocrine system. This disruption affects many normal processes and development in the body. Exposure to endocrine disruptors has been linked to infertility, an increased risk of cancer, harm to metabolism and interrupted brain development. Consumers can use resources like Skin Deep to avoid products made with endocrine disruptors so that they decrease their overall body burden. \u201cThis is one reason why cosmetics reform is urgently needed,\u201d said Leiba. \u201cCompanies can use almost any ingredient to make their products. People are exposed to chemicals like endocrine disruptors every day, but they can take steps to reduce their exposure with tools like EWG\u2019s Healthy Living app or by buying products with the EWG VERIFIED\u2122 mark. All of the ingredients used in consumer products should come with a cache of safety studies so we know how they\u2019ll affect our health.\u201d A new study from the Center for Environmental Research and Children\u2019s Health at the University of California, Berkeley, found that exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals used in a wide array of personal care products has been linked to early puberty among girls. Until Congress updates the law regulating cosmetics, consumers need to rely on third party seals to know which products meet the highest standards for transparency and health. With the EWG VERIFIED\u2122 mark, consumers know that researchers have found no worrisome ingredients, like the potentially harmful chemicals hidden under the umbrella term \u201cfragrance,\u201d and that the companies use good manufacturing practices. \u201cIf scientific evidence indicates that an ingredient is worrisome or concerning for health, the consumer should avoid it, because there are better options available,\u201d said Leiba. \u201cEurope has banned or restricted more than 1000 ingredients. In the U.S., consumers are used as guinea pigs. Until we\u2019re sure that an ingredient is safe, people should choose a healthier option.\u201d Cosmetics are woefully underregulated, and companies are not required to test their products for safety before they hit store shelves. Until the laws are strengthened, consumers should choose products that score well in Skin Deep or have been verified by EWG. They should also support companies that have reformulated their products to make them healthier. If a favorite product scores poorly, consumers should contact the company and tell it to do better.
