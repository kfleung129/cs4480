The South Korean retailer of beauty products with its unique skin care line composed of skin toner, liquid moisturizer, and various essences created a buzz upon its release especially because of its innovative know-how of mixing amino acids and polysaccharides components.  The South Korean government granted Amipure a special patent, recognizing this technology as Amipure\u2019s core achievement, further pushing Amipure to produce groundbreaking skin care products that had seemed impossible in the past. According to Amipure\u2019s founder Peter Cho, our skin has innate power to improve itself. \u201cAmipure\u2019s philosophy is to reduce the use of harmful ingredients in cosmetics and put only what is absolutely necessary to make skin healthy,\u201d says Cho who now focuses only on Amipure\u2019s product development. As a result, none of Amipure\u2019s products contain oil, artificial preservatives, superficial coloring, alcohol, added fragrances, and petroleum-based surfactants. Every single ingredient used to produce Amipure\u2019s entire line of products has been recognized as \u201cgreen\u201d by the Environmental Working Group (EWG). A green rating on EWG notes \u201clow hazard\u201d regarding ingredients used to produce various skin care products. Now available in the North American market via Amazon are three of Amipure\u2019s best selling products. The Meringue Bubble Cleanser (16.9 fl oz, retailing at $31.50) is a mild, scent-free daily cleanser which doubles as a makeup remover. Despite being able to remove even the heaviest of makeup, the Meringue Bubble Cleanser is ultimately mild, hypoallergenic and removed of all synthetic chemicals. Next on Amipure\u2019s Amazon lineup is a sulfate-free, deep scalp cleansing \u201cLike a Nopoo\u201d Shampoo minus any chemical foaming agents that strip away natural scalp oil. Lastly, Amipure\u2019s Amino Effect Mask (22ml pack of 10, retailing at $50.30) is made of premium quality cotton which includes amino and hyaluronic acids that deeply hydrate the driest of skin. During Amazon\u2019s Black Friday and Cyber Monday\u2019s sale period which initiates on November 28 and ends on December 2, the Meringue Bubble Cleanser will be sold at 30% off while Amipure\u2019s Shampoo and Mask will be discounted by 40%.
