The range initially launched in December last year with three products but has since expanded the line to include a toner, sunscreen and eye cream. The Centella Green range is water-based and features Centella Asiatica as its hero ingredient. The natural ingredient is rich in amino acids and renowned for its powerful anti-aging properties. \u201cBoasting a 49% Centella Asiatica content, the serum helps to stimulate collagen synthesis, calms inflamed skin and reduces pigmentation,\u201d\u200b said the brand. The brand also highlighted the Centella Green Level Calming Toner and the Centella Green Level Recovery Cream. The toner, contains Asiatic pennywort extract in a highly-enriched powder form, improving the appearance and texture of sensitive skin. Designed for use on face and neck, the cream contains a high concentration of Centella Asiatica to smooth and calm troubled skin. The texture of the cream was formulated to be light and fast-absorbing for consumers with sensitive skin who are looking for a \u201ckinder\u201d moisturiser, explained the brand. In addition to the natural ingredients, all products are packaged using recycled wrapping paper, highlighting the company\u2019s strong ethical responsibility and commitment to the environment, said Kim. \"We take our responsibility to the consumer and the environment extremely seriously, and our PURITO Centella Green range is one example of that.\"\u200b According to the brand, the range adheres to the Environmental Working Group (EWG) safety grade framework. \"We believe only natural and necessary ingredients should be added to derma cosmetic products, avoiding the use of alcohol and other potentially harmful ingredients such as PEGs, Phenoxyethanol and artificial flavouring agents,\"\u200b said Sunny Kim, director of PURITO. Its Centella Green Level Buffet Serum is certified by EWG and consists of ingredients ranked first or second in terms of safety by the EWG. It is the only product in the range with the certification. Last year, EWG ranked the serum along with PURITO\u2019s Fermented Complex 94 Boosting Essence in its \u201cBest Bets\u201d list. Currently, only these two products have the EWG mark, but the company stated it is preparing to get more of its products certified. Additionally, PURITO has registered some of its products, including three from the Centella Green range, with the Cosmetics Products Notification Portal (CPNP). This allows the brand to distribute the products to 27 member countries in the European Union and European Free Trade Association for 10 years.
