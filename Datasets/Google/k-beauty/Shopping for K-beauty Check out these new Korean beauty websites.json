    "text": "Where to shop for Korean skincare in 2020? These new Korean beauty websites make sure your shopping bag is filled to the brim with the best of K-Beauty. If there\u2019s one skincare need that doesn\u2019t ever go out of style, it\u2019s the fact that Indian women are obsessed with\u00a0Korean skincare. The reason is multi-faceted \u2013 Korean skincare is known to be effective, created with high quality ingredients and the results are almost always instant. That, apart from the fact that they have a few innovative sheet masks and come with acids and serums that are jam-packed with anti-oxidants and exotic ingredients like snail mucin and green tea. We have already listed a few of our favourite mainstream websites that are delivering everything from popular labels like Cosrx to lessen-known (but powerful nonetheless) Wishtrend classics. 2020 though, saw a bigger draw in Korean skincare and with rising demand came in bigger brands and better delivery systems and so a new set of Korean beauty websites are now here to give you your daily dose of K-beauty. Here are the new Korean beauty websites for the best of Korean skincare that is 100% authentic and directly sourced from the brands or authorized distributors.  The website aims to bring together clean and natural Korean skincare solutions with labels like Cosrx, By Wishtrend and Rovectin. There are not too many labels to choose from but the options in the brands put up is interesting and the collections are pretty much perfect for Indian skincare needs. You can also\u00a0DM them for a free skin consultation and they even help you create a personalised and bespoke skin regime.
