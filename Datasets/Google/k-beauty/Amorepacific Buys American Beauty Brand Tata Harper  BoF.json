    "text": "Agenda-setting intelligence, analysis and advice for the global fashion community. The South Korean beauty conglomerate says it has acquired the brand\u2019s parent Tata\u2019s Natural Alchemy as a stepping stone for its plan to accelerate expansion across North America. Founded in 2010 by Tata and Henry Harper, the upmarket American \u2018clean beauty\u2019 brand\u2019s products are sold across online channels including Net-A-Porter and Cult Beauty, along with about 800 offline stores, including the Sephora and Neiman Marcus chains. To complete the acquisition, Amorepacific has created a US special acquisition company (Spac) with capital of $125 million.\u00a0 The deal with Tata Natural will further strengthen Amorepacific\u2019s presence in the North American market, where in the second quarter of this year its sales soared by\u00a066 percent year on\u00a0year. However, not all brands in the group\u2019s portfolio have been a hit in the US. Last year the K-beauty giant announced that it was shuttering all stores of its Innisfree brand in North America, citing pressures from the pandemic. The South Korean firm\u2019s prioritisation of the US market comes on the back of signs that it is struggling in China, where earlier this year it announced the closure of the last brick-and-mortar outlet of its Hera brand. China accounts for approximately 70 percent of the group\u2019s sales in Asia.
