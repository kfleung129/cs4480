(Just in case you might\u2019ve forgotten, she was the girl on Dr. Phil who coined the phrase \u201ccash me outside, how \u2018bout dat?\u201d) Now the viral sensation, who\u2019s also known as rapper Bhad Bhabie, is making a mark in beauty. Copy Cat Beauty announced January 16 that the 15-year-old star signed a $900k deal with the budget-friendly cosmetic site. \u201cI\u2019m excited to work with CopyCatBeauty.com,\u201d she told Us in a statement. \u201cWhen I was sent the product to try, I started using it all the time, so working with them just makes sense.\u201d  And it could makes sense for your wallet, too \u2014 the brand aims to offer affordable alternatives to pricey products with similar formulations. That means you might spot a $10 dupe for the $50 palette you\u2019ve been eyeing on the site. Getting into makeup isn\u2019t the only thing she\u2019s been up to since her rise to fame in late 2016. In fact, Bhad Bhabie has built up an impressive resume with a reality TV deal, new singles \u2014 her \u201cHi Bich\u201d rap went gold in March! \u2014 and international tours. Most recently, she\u2019s also become the new face of Snapchat where she\u2019s currently filming a 12-episode original docu-series called Bringing Up Bhabie, coming out later this year. By the way things are going, it looks like she\u2019ll be making cash \u2014 no matter if she\u2019s indoors or out!
