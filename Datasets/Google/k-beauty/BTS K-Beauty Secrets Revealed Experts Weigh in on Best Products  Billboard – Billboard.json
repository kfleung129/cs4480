By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tYasmine Gray There are very few things not to love about Korean cosmetic products: they\u2019re affordable, effective, and now, thanks in part to Sephora\u00a0stocking brands like\u00a0Dr. Jart+, Glow Recipe and Tony Moly, accessible in the U.S. \u201cKorean brands work hard to create excitement and entertainment value around their products\u2014there are products out there for just about every possible aesthetic and budget,\u201d Jude Chao, K-beauty expert and editor-at-large of W2Beauty, the world\u2019s first K-Beauty social network, told Billboard of K-Beauty\u2019s growing international popularity. \u201cSince Korean beauty is very skin-focused, the skincare can be really special. The huge variety of brands means there are solid products out there in every category, for every skin type and concern.\u201d Related\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTravis Barker & Inkbox Team Up on a Temporary Tattoo Collection\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t09/27/2017\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tExplore\t\t\n\t\n\nSee latest videos, charts and news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBTS\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLifestyle\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nSee latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news BTS Score Top 10 Debut on Billboard 200 With \u2018Love Yourself: Her\u2019 Album After news that pop-sensation\u00a0BTS\u00a0was launching their own line of skincare, starting with sunscreen \u2014an ultra-important step in K-beauty skincare routines \u2014 fans went wild, but many were saddened after learning the harsh reality of\u00a0limited availability and distribution in the U.S. Luckily, though, Chao says that K-beauty\u2019s effectiveness is much more about the system than the individual products, meaning you still have a chance to achieve the band\u2019s coveted baby-smooth skin. W2Beauty,\u00a0which has been referred to as the \u201cFacebook of Korean beauty,\u201d came into inception after a group of Asian-American media leaders \u2014 Jude Chao, Anna Park, and James Sun \u2014 noticed the surge and popularity among K-beauty influencers and supporters in the U.S. and beyond. \u201cK-beauty is not only for Asians or Koreans,\u201d Sun, the first Asian-American finalist on Donald Trump\u2019s The Apprentice, noted. \u201cIn fact, the right K-beauty products can be perfect for skin types all around the world. Our team of writers and influencers are Asian, Latina, African American, and we have customers from the\u00a0Middle East\u00a0to\u00a0Latin America\u00a0to\u00a0Australia.\u201d So we caught up with co-founder\u00a0Jude Chao to learn about all things K-Beauty, including which products and regimes she suggests for getting that highly coveted BTS look.  What is the most important step of a K-beauty skincare regimen? Sunscreen! Sun protection is key to maintaining a youthful complexion, but it\u2019s hard to find a sunscreen at the drugstore that doesn\u2019t feel gross on the face. There are so many Korean sunscreens that deliver cosmetic elegance without sacrificing protection, which makes it way easier to actually wear sunscreen every day in the proper amounts. I can\u2019t do that with any typical [American] sunscreen, for example. What are the most popular K-beauty products? Sheet masks are always a huge draw and the most typical K-beauty \u201cgateway drug.\u201d They provide instant results, they\u2019re fun to use, and just like K-beauty as a whole, there\u2019s a sheet mask for just about every taste and every budget. I use a sheet mask almost every night! What is your personal K-beauty skincare routine? The products I use change pretty frequently as I test different items for my job and my personal blog/Instagram, but my overall routine stays the same. It\u2019s more about the system than the individual products. In the morning, I use a foaming cleanser, hydrating toner to plump up my skin, sometimes a lightweight moisturizer, and always a sunscreen. In the evenings, I double cleanse by doing a cleansing oil and then my foaming cleanser, then do a first essence (either Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum EX or COSRX Galactomyces 95 Whitening Power Essence), a serum or two, my COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence, usually a sheet mask, and then my nighttime moisturizer or sleeping pack. #BTS #????? #LOVE_YOURSELF ? \u2018Her\u2019 Concept Photo O version A post shared by BTS official (@bts.bighitofficial) on Sep 6, 2017 at 8:00am PDT From the looks of it, you can never have too much skin indulgence! Below, six of Chao\u2019s most-recommended K-beauty products that you\u2019ll need to get skin like BTS (and every other fresh-faced K-pop star).  Cleanser: I\u2019m into gentle, low-pH cleansers that clean without drying skin out or damaging the delicate moisture barrier. If you\u2019re drawn to luxe, check out Su:m37 Miracle Rose Cleansing Stick. It\u2019s a stick cleanser in a twist-up tube and comes with real rose petals embedded throughout the product! If you want something more budget-friendly, COSRX Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser is consistently popular. Toner: Son & Park Beauty Water is beloved among K-beauty fans. This multipurpose toner softens, hydrates, and very gently exfoliates for a super-smooth finish. It can also double as a cleansing water for morning skincare or after workouts. Serum: I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever find a serum I love as much as Sulwhasoo Capsulized Ginseng Fortifying Serum, which gives my skin an incredible resilience. I\u2019m also a lifetime fan of COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence. For me, it\u2019s THE snail product. It smooths, soothes, and lightly moisturizes my skin while accelerating the healing process when I\u2019m having skin troubles. Facial mask: Skinfood makes some stellar facial scrubs. The Rice Mask Wash Off is a soft and gentle exfoliator that also brightens and moisturizes, while the Black Sugar Strawberry Mask is a sugar scrub that smells like delicious strawberry jelly and gets skin baby soft. Plus they\u2019re dead cheap! Moisturizer: I switch out my moisturizers very frequently, and not all of them make an impression on me. Two that did are Swanicoco Ultra Elastic Vital Cream, which makes my face so incredibly soft that I can\u2019t stop touching it, and Amorepacific The Essential Cr\u00e8me Fluid, which I adore for day due to the way it absorbs fast, like a serum, while giving my dry-ish skin enough moisture to stay comfortable until the evening. Sulwhasoo Overnight Vitalizing Mask EX is my go-to sleeping pack. Never fails to give me bright, glowy, supple skin in the morning! Sunscreen:  Definitely A\u2019Pieu Pure Block Natural Sun Cream or A\u2019Pieu Pure Block Aqua Sun Gel. These very budget-friendly Korean sunscreens are ultra-light, non-greasy, dry down fast, and provide great UV protection for everyday use.
