    "text": "K-beauty has extended from a 15-minute trend\u00a0into a full blown movement. Korean skincare has long been ahead of the curve and now we see a surge forward with new makeup.\u00a0During Seoul Fashion Week, we got a chance to see what the city\u2019s best-dressed people were wearing on their bodies and on their faces. We see women embracing more natural skin looks while men join in on the contour/bronzing fad. Among these techniques are a handful of other makeup tricks that will help ladies transition from winter to spring. We selected items from our favorite brands to help recreate these profiles for the warm weather. Read on to learn more about the top five K-beauty makeup trends of 2019. ColourPop ColourPop BFF Liquid Liner, available at ColourPop for $8 USD Not everyone has the time for a full-out cut-crease eyeshadow look. Sliding on a colorful eyeliner allows you to add angles to your face that didn\u2019t exist before. It also can serve as an accessory to a monochrome outfit or subdued look. Our pick for this season is the new affordable eyeliner from ColourPop. Another great option is Too Faced\u2019s\u00a0Sketch Marker Liquid Art eyeliner ($20 USD).\n\u201cFruit-Juice\u201d Lips\n\n\n1 of 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlossier Play\n\n\n\n2 of 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLANC\u00d4ME Juicy Shaker Lip Oil, available at Nordstrom for $22 USD\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFruit juice\u201d or \u201cvitamin C\u201d lips are the super-glossy pouts you\u2019ve probably seen all over social media. Women careful choose a lip product that delivers shine and a healthy dose of color to create a stunning gradient. The result is a luscious lip that appears soft and has endless dimension. Clarins has an expansive selection of hues for its\u00a0Instant Light Lip Comfort Oil ($26 USD) which plumps the lips and gets rid of dryness.\nGlass Skin\n\n\n1 of 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeunghoon Jeong/HYPEBEAST KR\u00a0\n\n\n\n2 of 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaneige BB Cushion Pore Blur, available at Sephora for $38 USD\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGlass skin\u201d is the illusion of having poreless and\u00a0filter-like\u00a0smooth skin.
