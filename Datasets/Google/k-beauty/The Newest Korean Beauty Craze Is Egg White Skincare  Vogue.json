The incredible, edible egg\u2014long cited as a natural source of protein (including skin-tightening albumin) and collagen\u2014is staging an impressive topical comeback in Asia via high-tech formulas with airy, meringuelike textures that promise to eliminate blackheads, smooth fine lines, and brighten dull complexions\u2014no shell cracking necessary. \u201cKorean beauty brands are constantly innovating or bringing back trends in an upgraded way to delight consumers and stay competitive,\u201d explains Peach & Lily founder Alicia Yoon, who says she started seeing egg whites emerge as a \u201chero ingredient\u201d on the Eastern beauty scene about five years ago. The latest batch of eye-catching and effective beauty imports offers all the benefits found inside the egg\u2019s fragile exterior, minus the mess and risk of salmonella that the food is associated with. \u201cEgg whites contain collagen and a good bit of protein, which can enhance skin tone and vibrancy,\u201d says Connecticut-based dermatologist Mona Gohara. Infused into everything from creams to serums to sheet masks, the ingredient is perhaps most popular in the form of face wash: The second half of Soko Glam cofounder Charlotte Cho\u2019s double-cleansing routine consists of Skinfood Egg White Pore Foam, while Yoon says Mizon Egg White Bubble Cleanser has become a best-seller on her site and in her new brick-and-mortar boutique. The addition of egg whites to cleansers helps offset the drying side effects of surfactants and boost the skin\u2019s natural lipids, explains New York City dermatologist Ellen Marmur. Other egg-centric finds to add to your basket: Too Cool for School\u2019s Egg Mousse face mask has already reached cult status in Korea, with its fluffy combo of pore-minimizing egg white and nourishing yolk extracts that leaves skin looking fresh in five minutes. TonyMoly\u2019s egg-shaped blackhead gel\u2014a self-heating balm that uses charcoal powder, sea salt, and eggshell powder as a magnet for dirt and oil\u2014spotlights the ingredient\u2019s purifying powers. However, Korea isn\u2019t the first country to harness the ingredient outside of the kitchen. Swedish women have sworn by Lanolin-\u00c4gg-Tv\u00e4l egg white soap to maintain their clear complexions for generations. And stateside, Perricone MD employs the fine-line\u2013fighting powers of eggshell membrane and retinol in its latest serum. Above, eight products that lend new meaning to the idea of egg on your face. By signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.
