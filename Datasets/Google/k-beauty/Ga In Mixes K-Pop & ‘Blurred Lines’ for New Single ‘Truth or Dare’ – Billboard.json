    "text": "PSY's \"Gentleman\" video co-star Ga In, the \"most rumored about\" Korean singer, gets the last laugh in her \"Truth or Dare.\" The track is recommended for fans of Robin Thicke's \"Blurred Lines\" or Brown\u2026 By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJeff Benjamin After kicking off her comeback with the brazen buzz track \u201cFxxk U,\u201d Ga In returns with her new single \u201cTruth or Dare,\u201d sure to delight anyone who got down to Robin Thicke\u2019s \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d \u2014 and who hadn\u2019t? Like the 2013 Song of the Summer, \u201cTruth or Dare\u201d incorporates the familiar disco groove beat, peppy percussion and cowbell dings \u2014 though the \u201cGentleman\u201d co-star jazzes up the chorus with additional saxophone embellishments throughout.

She sings in her signature baby-like delivery, \u201cWant to know the truth? / All the truth? / The important thing is that you talk about me / The more, it\u2019s nice, very nice / It\u2019s better to have more rumors\u201d \u2014 essentially beating haters to the punch.   The \u201cTruth or Dare\u201d visual (below) directly coincides with the lyrics as half music video, half \u201cfake documentary,\u201d as label LOEN Music describes it. Ga In dances in tight shirts and dresses in between a series of \u201ccandid\u201d interviews about the K-pop star. An extension of what we saw in the teaser for her \u201cTruth or Dare\u201d album, a host of artists and Ga In collaborators speak about the singer, covering everything from her drinking habits to her breasts to the fact that she\u2019s the \u201cmost rumored\u201d about K-pop star. Ga In Sends Buzz Single \u2018Fxxk U\u2019 to No. 2 on K-Pop Hot 100 Is it all true? Probably not, as the lyrics are about the difference between believing what you hear or believing what you see with your own eyes. But in a meta moment near the video\u2019s conclusion, Ga In is shown stripped of her sexy outfits and styled hair, telling the camera, \u201cI think that when I leave my house, I starting acting. Just, living. Isn\u2019t it all acting?\u201d making the viewer wonder whether she\u2019s acting while speaking about acting or if she\u2019s finally telling us her truth in this \u201cfake documentary.\u201d Whatever\u2019s real, the nearly-eight-minute music video solidifies Ga In as a K-pop star with one of the juiciest personalities out there.
