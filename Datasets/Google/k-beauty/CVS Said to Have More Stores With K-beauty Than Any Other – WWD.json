    "text": "The chain will install K-Beauty HQ in 2,100 stores. subscriber CVS Pharmacy wants to be more than just an echo in the K-beauty boom. Next month, the nation\u2019s mega drugstore chain will outfit 2,100 of its doors with an assortment handpicked by Alicia Yoon, a trailblazer in the K-beauty explosion. The founder of Peach & Lily, Yoon partnered with CVS to identify 100-plus trendsetting and cult favorites for in-store boutiques, called K-Beauty HQ. Kline estimates beauty items from South Korea produce sales of $225 million in the U.S., up 30 percent since 2015. There\u2019s tremendous potential with many U.S. women still not exposed to South Korean innovation. With its commitment to K-beauty, industry sources believe CVS alone can add another $100 million to that total if the assortment clicks. CVS would not comment on projections.  \u201cCVS will be the first retailer of its kind with such reach and visibility,\u201d Yoon said. \u201cGoing into so many doors, this is going to be a really big contributing factor, propelling [South] Korean beauty forward in terms of awareness.\u201d To her knowledge, Yoon said CVS will have K-beauty in more stores than any other retailer in the world.

In addition to her Peach & Lily web site, she has curated assortments for Macy\u2019s, created her own sheet masks, set up a mask bar in Barney\u2019s and collaborated with Target to put 13 popular South Korean beauty items onto its shelves. \u201cWe wanted to do this in a big way \u2014 not just a few items, not just a few stores,\u201d said Alex Perez-Tenessa, CVS\u2019 vice president, merchandising manager of beauty. He explained K-beauty, puts a heavy emphasis on skin care, which fits snugly with the chain\u2019s dedication to wellness and beauty. \u201cK-beauty is much more than just trend. We think it is a global beauty movement and something our customers are ready for and demanding.\u201d To get the right mix, Perez-Tenessa said it was critical to link with Yoon in order to decide what is relevant to CVS shoppers \u2014 especially with the breadth of choices coming from South Korea. The chain pledges to be \u201cnimble,\u201d to add innovation as it debuts. Yoon\u2019s omnichannel approach targets each retailer with a different strategy. With more than 10,000 brands in South Korea, she has the luxury to match the lines with the retail outlet. \u201cWe wanted to make [South] Korean beauty accessible to all,\u201d Yoon told WWD. \u201cCVS is ubiquitous. Now [South] Korean beauty can be only a five minute walk away.\u201d They can experiment without breaking the bank with price points, ranging from $2.99 for masks to $30 for facial moisturizers, Yoon maintains.  In the case of CVS, Yoon saw fertile territory for an offshoot of Peach & Lily called Peach Slices, which encompasses products and a retail concept.\u00a0\u201cCVS is the right retail partner to take on Peach Slices,\u201d she explained, describing the collection as the whimsical, innovative and fun-loving sister of Peach & Lily. \u00a0The drugstore environment, she noted, requires products that stop shoppers in their paths, but are also effective, which brings them back for more. Carrie Mellage, vice president of consumer products for Kline, thinks the move is smart for both parties, especially since Yoon can edit the assortment so it doesn\u2019t duplicate what other channels offer.\u00a0\u201c[South] Korean beauty remains one of the hottest trends in the market. It started in luxury channels and has already migrated to the mass market,\u201d she said. \u201cThe market is absolutely ready for the trend to go even further mainstream, and this new assortment will offer CVS shoppers greater assortment and newness that beauty shoppers crave.\u201d CVS\u2019 Perez-Tenessa said the chain put K-beauty on its radar a few years ago with the emergence of BB creams. \u201cThe explosion of sheet masks was the final indicator that American was ready for K-beauty,\u201d he said. The K-Beauty HQ collection will be highlighted in stores by special signage featuring educational materials. The location will be either on a New Trend wall concept where hot products are displayed or on shelves,\u00a0near facial skin care. This is the latest example of CVS adding on trend products \u2014 more than 2,800 new beauty items were added last year alone. CVS beauty consultants will be trained on the assortment. Yoon said she selected items that will stand out in mass stores where shoppers might not expect these items. \u201cPackaging needs to be compelling because a customer might be going to the pharmacy or front of store for other needs. As they are walking down the aisle, they see this entire world of packaging that stops them in their tracks,\u201d she said. \u201cBut packaging alone isn\u2019t enough; the products have to delight so they come back for more. And it is easy because there is a store on every corner.\u201d Many of the items curated for CVS include those that are new to the U.S. and several are exclusive to CVS. That includes her homegrown Peach Slices, a preventative skin collection. Within that lineup, Yoon singles out Citrus-Honey Aqua Glow, a hydrating moisture gel.  Other brands found only at CVS in the U.S. include Frudia, a waterless fruit-based collection, Elisha Coy with snail mucin, the pore-focused JJYoung by Caolion and the unique Ariul EGG Collection, which introduces egg oil to America. Rounding out the four- to eight-foot sections \u2014 depending on store size \u2014 are other items that haven\u2019t been easy to purchase in the mass market. These include: the Saem natural products, Holika Holika items such as the whimsically named Pig-Nose Clear Black Head Kit and masks from Ariul. Since many of the lines are new to the U.S. and CVS consumers, both parties will ramp up social media support and provide educational materials on web sites.
