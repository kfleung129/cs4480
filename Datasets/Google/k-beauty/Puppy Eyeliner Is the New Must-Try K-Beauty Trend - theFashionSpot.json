    "text": "By\n\nCordelia Tai  When disc jockey extraordinaire Diplo transformed himself into the \u201cvomiting rainbow\u201d Snapchat filter this past Halloween, it got us thinking. If only there was a way to bring our favorite hilarious and inexplicably mesmerizing Snapchat personas to life. Well, for those of you obsessed with the \u201clicking dog\u201d lens, we\u2019ve got good news. A new beauty trend just in from Korea \u2014 where seemingly all great skin and makeup tricks are born \u2014 takes its inspiration from (wo)man\u2019s best friend. A photo posted by Kristinova (@katyaisabell) on Apr 16, 2016 at 6:39am PDT  \u201cPuppy eye\u201d creates the illusion of a rounder, larger eye, giving wearers an\u00a0innocent, Bambi-esque gaze. The playful K-beauty liner technique is a welcome answer to the omni-present sultry cat eye\u00a0and, thankfully, much easier to master. (To be frank, infuriatingly uneven wings were half the reason we hopped on the natural makeup\u00a0bandwagon.)  \u201cAll you need to do is draw a line along the upper lash line and right when you\u2019re about to the mid-point of the eye, instead of swooping it up like you do with the cat eye, you actually drop it down and follow the natural curve of the eye,\u201d explained Charlotte Cho, founder of Soko Glam, during an appearance on Amazon\u2019s Style Code Live. \u201cThen you do the lower lash, and you line along that lower lash line and connect it to the top line and it almost forms a tiny triangle, right in the corner of the eye, which creates a very puppy[-like] look.\u201d\u00a0As with any makeup trick, you can be as bold or as subtle as you like with the look \u2014 check out the hashtag #puppyeyemakeup on Instagram for a handful of variations on the theme.

Plus, when you\u2019re asking your boss for that raise at work, it couldn\u2019t hurt to resemble a corgi who\u2019s just gotten a whiff of bacon, now could it?
