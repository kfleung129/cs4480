    "text": "By A. Khan Seems like everyone we know is basically living for facial sheet masks. On Insta, Snapchat, and even on planes, it seems like we can't escape the sheet-mask craze that's swept the skin-care world. Maybe you're even using one right now, because, you know, it's Labor Day Weekend? Well buckle up because there's a sheet-mask scandal that's rocking the K-beauty world and has us questioning our #FacemaskMonday go-tos. With single-serving packages, we assume that sheet masks are extra clean, no germs in sight\u2014right? Not quite. Our friends at Racked did some digging into just how clean these masks are. And you really won\u2019t like what they found. For example, it was discovered that the masks weren\u2019t folded by machines, but by human hands using the same piece of cardboard to manually fold each mask over and over again. What's more, \u201cRacked found in a review of Korean press and social media coverage that several brands have been identified as using at-home labor for folding and stuffing sheet masks into their envelopes,\u201d the story reads. At-home labor for skin care? Not. Cool. __Here's what happens when a few friends tried the carbonated bubble mask: __ This at-home labor\u2014without a license\u2014is illegal in Korea, however, because the industry isn't tightly regulated by the KFDA, it happens more commonly than you'd expect it to. (Could you fold a sheet mask without contamination in your home?) If all this wasn\u2019t enough to turn you off to using masks, maybe this photo of an actual factory will. A Korean blogger posted images of unsanitary conditions several years ago. Peep the photos Racked ran of masks with what looks like random hair on them (we can't be sure.) Either way\u2014gross. If you just can\u2019t give up your masks, do some research before you put one on. Ask questions: Is the brand using entirely automated facilities? Is there any bit of at-home labor? If the purpose of these is to soak in whatever\u2019s on the mask, you\u2019d better make sure you know exactly what that is. So go wash your face and maybe skip the sheet mask this weekend if you haven't done your research.
