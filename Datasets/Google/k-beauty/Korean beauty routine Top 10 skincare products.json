Double cleansing is recommended by aestheticians and dermatologists as it thoroughly removes impurities that can cause breakouts. Water-based cleansers pick up the excess oil and dirt your oil cleanser didn\u2019t. Editor\u2019s Pick: Skinfood Egg White Pore Foam SHOP IT: Soko Glam, $11 It\u2019s important to exfoliate your skin regularly. It helps your other skincare products absorb better and work more efficiently. Exfoliation penetrates the pores to remove excess sebum and dead skin cells, to reveal a brighter and smoother complexion.But be wary! Depending on your skin type, excessively exfoliating can have harsh results on your skin. A good rule of thumb is to exfoliate three to four times a week. Editor\u2019s Pick: SATURDAY SKIN Rub-A-Dub Refining Peel Gel SHOP IT: Soko Glam, $28 Toning is like primer, but for skincare. It preps the skin by removing leftover residue left behind from your cleansers, while neutralizing your skin\u2019s moisture barrier and pH levels. Editor\u2019s Pick: Benton ALOE BHA Skin Toner SHOP IT: Soko Glam, $19 Essences, often mistaken for toners, are lightweight formulas packed with a concentrated blend of skin-enhancing ingredients. Depending on what your skin needs, look for ones formulated with rice extract, birch juice and hyaluronic acid. Sprinkle a couple of drops into your hands and lightly push it into the face and neck. Editor\u2019s Pick: MISSHA Time Revolution First Treatment Essence Intensive Moist SHOP IT: Soko Glam, $52 Our favourite step of all. Packed with powerhouse ingredients like vitamin C, retinol, and glycolic acid, serum treatments target specific skin concerns such as acne, hyperpigmentation, fine lines and so much more. Editor\u2019s Pick: COSRX Triple C Lightning Liquid SHOP IT: Soko Glam, $27 Sheet masks are arguably the heart of Korean skincare. When the sheet is in prolonged contact with your face, it allows the skin to fully absorb its key nutrients and concentrated formula. While there are endless ranges of infused ingredients to love, we suggest leaning towards cucumber, aloe, and green tea. Editor\u2019s Pick: KLAIRS Rich Moist Soothing Tencel Sheet Mask SHOP IT: Soko Glam, $3 No matter how old you are, eye cream is a must! We can\u2019t stress this enough.
