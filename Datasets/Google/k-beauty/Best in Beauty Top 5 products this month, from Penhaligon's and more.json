    "text": "From the overfilled shelves of our bathrooms and the full-length mirrors we sit across blearily every morning picking potions and lotions from overstuffed makeup bags, to you and wherever your stash of serums and creams inhabit,\u00a0Best in Beauty\u00a0rounds up the very best products we\u2019ve smeared across our faces and spritzed upon our pulse points this month. I\u2019m a creature of habit, so it only makes sense that I\u2019ve been using the same cleanser since high school. This month, though, things got super busy and repurchasing my holy grail cleanser just slipped my mind. Faced with an empty bottle, I grabbed whatever sample I had in my drawer. That sample turned out to be QV\u2019s Gentle Wash. Tbh, I\u2019d been meaning to give the QV brand a try for a while now, ever since similar drugstore brands like CeraVe and Cetaphil picked up steam on TikTok. Inexpensive and easily available at basically any major retailer in Hong Kong, including Watsons, Mannings and HKTVMall, I knew it would be a godsend if I ended up liking the cleanser. And like the cleanser I did. First, QV\u2019s Gentle Wash is made specifically for dry and sensitive skin, aka made specifically for me. Next, it helps maintain hydration, which is something my skin needs, even in Hong Kong\u2019s ridiculously humid weather (my chin keeps peeling and it\u2019s not a pretty sight). It\u2019s also non-comedogenic so it won\u2019t block pores, which makes it suitable for the unfortunate few with acne-prone skin (me, again). With my previous holy grail cleanser, my face always felt squeaky clean but \u201ctight\u201d after use. With QV\u2019s Gentle Wash, though, my skin simply feels soothed and comfortable after a quick rinse with water. I mean, this has got to be an improvement, right? Anyway, after some research, I deducted it\u2019s because the cleanser contains 15% glycerin, a humectant that allows the skin to retain moisture easily. If you\u2019re looking for a mild, effective and affordable daily cleanser for your face and even body, I can\u2019t recommend QV\u2019s Gentle Wash enough. \u2014 Charmaine Ng, Editor Falling under the same category as bug spray and sunscreen, a bite-relief cream is the kind of functional beauty product that\u2019ll work double-time to make routines \u2014 no, sorry life \u2014 so much better. It\u2019s exactly the purpose of\u00a0PARA\u2019KITO\u2019s Bite Relief Roll-On Gel, a compact, pocket-size cylindrical bottle of what is about to become the lifeline you need to surviving a humid Hong Kong summer. The clear gel formula \u2014 labelled in this edition as \u201cSoothing\u201d \u2014 leaves behind a cool, refreshing chill immediately after applying, with a mild mintiness in scent. Designed as a remedy to reduce the itch after nasty mosquito bites, PARA\u2019KITO\u2019s products are made only with plant extracts and can be used on all skin types, including the most sensitive. However unbearable the bite may be, or whatever the pest it was from, this little roll-on will offer all the solace you need. \u2014 Lorria Sahmet, Editor Penhaligon\u2019s The World According to Arthur ignites the mental picture of rising incense in a sophisticated wood interior, which is a welcome departure from the olfactory families populating my bedside shelf. Labelled with keywords such as \u201cthe East\u201d and \u201cwisdom\u201d, this crimson elixir comes in a gold-tone dragon bottle cap, unsheathing sweet, ambery notes upon your skin while the zenness of incense overtakes the air. I\u2019ve been stealing sniffs at this perfume far too often; here\u2019s my plead for it to be made a home fragrance. \u2014 Michelle Chan, Editor Under Hong Kong\u2018s humid weather, it\u2019s been a challenge for me to keep my skin hydrated without it getting sticky or oily, so I was on a quest to find a product to remedy that. I first tried Rare Skin Fuel\u2019s Activating Mist when I was walking through Causeway Bay. My makeup was starting to melt under the heat so my friend pulled out the mist and asked me to try it on. Like magic, my foundation and eyeliner stayed on for the rest of the day. Made with organic aloe vera juice and anti-aging ingredients, the mist helps calm the skin. It can be used as a toner before face cream, settling spray before or after makeup or a pick-me-up if you\u2019re outdoors and need some hydration. As someone who is too lazy to own too many products, this multi-use spray is perfect for my summer days. \u2014 Leanne Lam, Social Media Manager Here's where you can read the latest news and stories from Lifestyle Asia and our sister titles PrestigeOnline and Augustman, curated from all of our editions in Hong Kong, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and India.
