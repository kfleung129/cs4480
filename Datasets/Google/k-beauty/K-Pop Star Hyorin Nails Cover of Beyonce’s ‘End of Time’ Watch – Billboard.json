Impressively, the South Korea native performed every word of the English track, even hitting the quick, staccato notes after the second chorus.

The K-diva incorporated Beyonce\u2019s signature hair flips and hip thrusts while adding in Hyorin\u2019s new \u201ccrab legs\u201d move, seen in the music video for \u201cOne Way Love\u201d (below). Hyorin\u2019s pronunciation isn\u2019t perfect, but for a non-native English speaker the cover is impressive. It will not only further fuel the Beyonce comparisons, but could also see a few Bey Hive members getting into Hyorin if they love hair flips, hip thrusts and diva belting.
