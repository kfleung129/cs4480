Famed fashion blogger Aimee Song most recently became the brand\u2019s ambassador, using the AHC Hyaluronic range and even attempted the K-beauty trend by applying facial toner seven times. South Korean actress Oh Yeon-seo - the embodiment of Korean beauty - too joined the ranks as AHC ambassador. She shared: \u201cPeople talk about the radiance of Korean beauty as if it\u2019s a mystery. What\u2019s my secret? I use AHC skincare, created and perfected in Korean aesthetic clinics. Now my secret can be your secret.\u201d The brand prides itself in ensuring that hydration is the core benefit in every of its skincare range. In fact, AHC stands for \u201cAesthetic Hydration Cosmetics\u201d. Here are four AHC skincare products that will set you off on the right path to achieving that dewy, soft and bouncy, fresh as a daisy skin glow (Chok-Chok). After all, it\u2019s very much all about the K-beauty philosophy to perfect the skin first before enhancing it with makeup. 1. Premium Hydra B5  Cleanse, tone and hydrate are undeniably the most basic and important steps in every skin care regime. For a refreshed skin with an effervescent complexion, AHC\u2019s premium Hydra B5 line is optimised for deep moisture care.
