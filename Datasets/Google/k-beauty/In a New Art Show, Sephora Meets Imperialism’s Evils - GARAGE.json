    "text": " Walking into Tiffany Jaeyeon Shin\u2019s  Universal Skin Salvation installation at the sprawling Knockdown Center in Maspeth, Queens is like entering a science lab crossed with a Sephora. Tubes, spritzer bottles, and more, all containing a pearly white substance, sit on pedestals. As with samples in beauty stores, anyone\u2019s welcome to try the products, which are flanked by what look like delicate, surreal beauty advertisements and textbook pages that note that Korean skin becomes \u201clike porcelain\u201d after K-beauty products, with an \u201cimpermeable glossiness\u201d that\u2019s more glass than flesh. Rather than fully visible faces or bodies on display, we get only detached hints: a fingertip applying serum here, a foam-clad cheek there, giving the substances more priority than the humans they\u2019re applied to. Nearby, large vats of lactic acid, the chemical foundation for these elixirs, lie on a makeshift table. Some have tubes in them, others funnels. In the center of the room, there\u2019s a large cube that appears to be made entirely of clouds. Enter it and you\u2019ll find yourself in a lactic acid sauna, with vapor so thick it\u2019s easy to lose yourself. Beauty, as they say, may be skin deep, but in Shin\u2019s show, the obsession with Korean beauty products\u2014skin lighteners, snail slime sheet masks, vitamin C serum, and the vague category of \u201cessences,\u201d\u2014is a cross-cultural phenomenon heavy with sociopolitical implications. As Shin told me when I first interviewed her for an exhibition on similar themes last April, Western interest in K-beauty appears to her as \u201cpeople literally trying to achieve Korean flesh without wanting the subject of the Korean person and their stories.\u201d K-beauty is more popular than ever: sales have reportedly grown 300% in Asia and the US since 2015. \u201cIt's like, if you use these ten steps, Korean skin is available through cultural possession and ornamentation. I think it\u2019s clever what they did, because it\u2019s pretty successful,\u201d she adds. Shin traces American desire for the Korean woman back to the 1950s and the Korean War, when members of the US military sought the services of South Korean \u201ccomfort women,\u201d a euphemism for women who were tricked or forced into sex work, often facing further oppression like detainment and involuntary, painful STI treatments. (In fact, the history of \u201ccomfort women\u201d goes back even further, originating in World War II.) This American introduction to the Korean woman, and her flesh, through physical objectification supports Shin\u2019s argument that literal objects such as beauty products are now a way to locate Korean identity and agency, once again bypassing personhood in favor of the physical. It may seem strange to claim K-beauty\u2019s popularity reflects that \u201cyellowness\u201d is more desirable in the West, when many of these products make skin that isn\u2019t already pale appear lighter. But these two things don\u2019t exist at opposite ends of a binary. The desire for \u201cporcelain\u201d skin has been ingrained in Korean culture for some time now, but Shin argues that this is a result of the aforementioned wartime and American colonization: it became safer, and more appealing, for South Korean women to assimilate and stay in close proximity to whiteness, both culturally and physically. America\u2019s love for K-beauty is doubly complicated, then\u2014wanting another culture\u2019s magical beauty regimen reflects an exoticization and fetishization of Korean skin, but that regimen is derived from \u201ca preferred lack of pigment\u201d that itself comes from the history of Western colonialism as well as classism, as darker, tanned skin historically denoted a life of outdoor labor while fair skin was associated with wealthier people who didn\u2019t need to toil. Shin is also interested in how K-beauty\u2019s lengthy ten-step routine (oil cleanser, water-based cleanser, exfoliator, toner, essence, treatments, sheet mask, eye cream, moisturizer, sun protectant) intersects with Korean culture and history. She sees a desire for Korean \u201crehabilitation\u201d after the war and Japanese imperialism, and identifies a labor-intensive focus on achieving perfect skin as a part of that process. Shin believes that Americans\u2019 skin and humanity are also \u201ctraumatized,\u201d and that we\u2019re seeking to improve with K-beauty, too. The exhibition\u2019s lactic acid sauna (sizable enough to fit two people) digs deeper than skincare\u2014where it\u2019s used to boost skin turnover, exfoliate, and make the skin appear brighter, and in some cases, lighter\u2014and connects the themes of her show to the material\u2019s use in products both applied to the body and literally consumed. Lactic acid is present in fermented items like kimchi, where it can help fortify the gut and even allegedly soothe PTSD symptoms, and it\u2019s also naturally produced by human muscles. To Shin, there\u2019s a \u201cparadox\u201d in lactic acid\u2019s ability to benefit the body and contribute to the pursuit of whiteness. It \u201cencompasses the compromising position that yellow female bodies are in, where the lactic acid enlivens her or animates her hardened or plasticized body,\u201d she says, \u201cbut also entrenches her into a system of \u2018lactification,\u2019\u201d a term referring to the whitening of skin. This skincare boom has helped boost Korea\u2019s visibility, economy, and skin quality, but has done so while simultaneously supporting Western, white beauty ideals. Shin cautions against characterizing the show as solely focusing on a desire for whiteness. \u201cI think it\u2019s a really complex topic, and I think it being reduced and essentialized in that way is at risk of not recognizing other sides of yellowness,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m specifically talking about yellowness because I think \u2018Asia\u2019 is such a huge continent [and] term\u2026I think yellowness has been described in America to talk about adjacency towards whiteness, and the desire for it to become white. I\u2019m more interested in complicating those notions.\u201d K-beauty products, she explains, are \u201clike the skin of the Korean woman,\u201d but these objects are prioritized more than Korean personhood. And the ideal \u201cglass skin\u201d K-beauty claims to produce is something so perfect it practically stops being skin altogether. \u201cK-beauty wearers are promised with possibilities of endless modification and transformation,\u201d one of Shin\u2019s posters says. If one product doesn\u2019t deliver on its promises of perfection, you can always try another brand, another formula. Despite all this critique, Shin doesn\u2019t want the exhibition\u2019s takeaway to be that K-beauty is evil, or to condemn Korean women, and cites her \u201cfrustration in seeing my body becoming a fetish commodity.\u201d Shin explains, \u201cOf course I'm being critical of K-beauty, but if it [wasn\u2019t] K-beauty, it would have always been something else.\u201d She still uses these products on occasion, but they\u2019ve become more \u201cart objects\u201d to her now. They\u2019re something to look at, to think about, and use to find new ways of seeing the world. Tiffany Jaeyeon Shin\u2019s Universal Skin Salvation is on view at Knockdown Center through December 16, with a discussion on November 29 and a performance lecture on December 13.
