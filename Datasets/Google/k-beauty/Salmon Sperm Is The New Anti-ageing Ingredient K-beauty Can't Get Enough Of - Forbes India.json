In search of natural alternatives to the chemical components found in some cosmetics, sometimes the beauty industry makes unexpected finds. One of the latest is salmon sperm. Already present in several formulas from K-Beauty brands, it's appreciated for its numerous anti-aging virtues.It's become clear that nature is full of treasures with properties that are beneficial to our health and skin. Olive oil, shea butter, aloe vera and tea are all ingredients that fit well in our beauty routines.
