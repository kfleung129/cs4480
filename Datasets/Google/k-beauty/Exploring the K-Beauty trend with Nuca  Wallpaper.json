Sovo, a handmade shoe firm hailing from Korea has joined forces with brand consulting company Eggplant Factory, in a perhaps unexpected union, pooling together their efforts to create Nuca, a new cosmetics brand.\n\nThe name 'nuca' was taken from the Spanish word for nape, on which the brand plays metaphorically to signify a woman\u2019s sensuality. With hydrating masks and makeup, we\u2019re particularly taking note of the two bestsellers: the Gentle Moisturising Pink Cushion, a dewy CC cream that is infused with anti-ageing hyaluronic acid and cherry blossom extract, while in its Hydro Mega Waterfall Cream (below), beautifying pearl powder extract provides 24-hour hydration.  Hydro Mega Waterfall Cream Contained in contemporary pastel-hued pots, the cosmetics have been wrapped in pretty matte packaging, evoking a futuristic feel. Combined with its modern attitude and drive to encourage women to express their own beauty without feeling the pressure to conform to social norms, Nuca is quickly becoming the latest rage amongst K-beauty fans.
