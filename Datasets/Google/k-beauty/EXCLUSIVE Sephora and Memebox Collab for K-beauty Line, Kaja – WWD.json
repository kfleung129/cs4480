    "text": "The 47-unit line aims to meet diverse consumer needs, something specific to the American market. Beauty Editor, Finance Kaja, a new K-beauty makeup line, is launching at Sephora. The 47 stockkeeping-unit lineup is the result of a year\u2019s worth of collaboration between San Francisco-based K-beauty company Memebox and Sephora, which made a deal last September to work together on the products. \u201cSephora had this white space, which was K-beauty makeup,\u201d said Dino Ha, chief executive officer and cofounder. So, Memebox \u2014 specifically Yoon Sung Choi, vice president of brand development \u2014 spent months researching in South Korea and five months on product development to bring South Korean makeup techniques into products that were specifically tailored to U.S. shoppers. \u201cK-beauty is known for skin care, but I don\u2019t think we had great credibility when it comes to color,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when you come to Korea, it\u2019s a really exciting place for color makeup, but no one knows how to translate K-beauty color to the U.S. market, because the U.S. consumer is looking for diversity and inclusivity.\u201d Related Articles\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tBeauty Features\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\tBobbi Brown on Three Years of Jones Road\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tBeauty Features\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\tBuilding a Lifestyle Powerhouse With David Neville and Gucci Westman Geared toward Millennials and Gen Z, Kaja focuses on bringing the interesting textures K-beauty is known for into makeup.\u00a0The lineup includes multiple shades of blushes, highlighters, concealers, eye shadows, brow gels and three different lip products, priced between $14 and $24. Kaja launches online at sephora.com Sept. 18. The full line will launch in 58 Sephora doors Sept. 28, and certain products will be in 400 Sephora doors Oct. 5. The Memebox team declined to talk numbers, but industry sources estimated the line could do between $3 million and $5 million in sales during its first year. The product lineup includes: the Cheeky Stamp, a cushion-compact style blush with heart-shaped cushion stamper;\u00a0Mochi Glow, a blendable, buildable cream-to-powder highlighter;\u00a0Mochi Pop, a buildable cream-to-powder blush; Don\u2019t Settle, a light, buildable concealer;\u00a0Blur Drop, a moisturizing and blurring primer with a satin finish; Cat Nap, an under-eye brightener;\u00a0Beauty Bento, stacked shimmer eye shadows with a gel formula; Brow Blowout, a fiber-brow gel with vitamin E; Cushy Vibe, a lip stain with water-capture technology meant to retain lip moisture; Mood Balm, a moisturizing, pH-adjusting\u00a0balm, and 2\u2019s Company, a set of nude lipstick and liner duos meant to contour lips. Some of the products were inspired by Mochi ice cream in South Korea, Choi said. \u201cWhen you touch it, it melts like cream and moves around like ice cream, and when you apply it again, it\u2019s like powder,\u201d she said. In addition to new textures, Kaja is focused on bringing products to market quickly, something Choi says is part of the \u201ccultural background.\u201d Going forward, the Kaja team does not have a full lineup planned, but expects new products will come out \u201cvery often,\u201d as requested by Sephora, Ha said. \u201cIf Sephora sees a white space they see as an opportunity, they\u2019ll inform us and we\u2019ll try to meet that,\u201d Ha said.  The launch comes at a time when some eyes have turned to J-beauty, which has recently picked up as a trend in the U.S. market. But Ha says that despite J-Beauty\u2019s entrance, K-beauty isn\u2019t slowing down. \u201cK-beauty will stay as a global phenomenon because of the principles of K-beauty \u2014 customer centric, having great innovation and processes to build fast beauty, as well as having different perspectives around the experience,\u201d Ha said. \u201cThere is still huge demand from K-beauty\u2026.J-beauty is not able to fill those diversity or inclusivity [needs] when it comes to color,\u201d Choi added. Kaja is not the first brand Memebox, which has raised more than $156 million in venture capital funding, has brought into the U.S. market. The business is also behind I Dew Care and Nooni, which are both sold at Ulta Beauty as well as on the Memebox site, but Kaja is Memebox first true collaboration with a retail partner in terms of brand development. It\u2019s also the business\u2019 first big move since it relaunched e-commerce on its own web site, which is allowing it to gather a significant amount of data.
