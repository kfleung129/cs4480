While Psy stole the show in 2012 with \"Gangnam Style,\" this year's event will be remembered for its collaborations between K-Pop stars and other musical acts. Cantopop king Aaron Kwok and girl group Sistar's Hyolyn joined Stevie Wonder at the end of the awards show for a rendition of \"I Just Called to Say I Love You,\" and Swedish girl duo Icona Pop teamed up with 2NE1's CL. Meanwhile, two of the year's biggest novelty acts -- Norway's Ylvis\u00a0and Crayon Pop -- entertained the audience with a performance of the girl group's \"Bar Bar Bar,\" with the brothers also donning Crayon Pop's trademark motorcycle helmets.
