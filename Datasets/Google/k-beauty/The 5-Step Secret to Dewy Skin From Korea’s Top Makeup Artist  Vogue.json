This is, after all, one of Korea\u2019s top makeup artists, a man who studied with Shu Uemura in Tokyo and helped pioneer no-makeup makeup back home, launching his popular line, Son & Park. Park is here to break down his secret to dewy skin\u2014that almost surreally radiant glow that K-beauty is known for and which Park and his business partner, Son Dae Sik, have championed for years. For Korean women, he explains, it\u2019s about youth over beauty. \u201cInstead of being told they look pretty, they want to be told they look young,\u201d Park says, sweeping a soft cotton pad across my face. \u201cThat means dewy skin\u2014not matte and dull like mature skin, but shiny and soft like a baby\u2019s.\u201d According to Park, the two most important steps toward achieving this effect are exfoliation and hydration. To help with the latter, his foundation stick comes formulated with hydrating shea butter and essence, while its argan oil core gives skin an extra glow, especially when buffed out with a brush. A small pop of color on the lips and cheeks will also brighten the skin, he explains. \u201cThe red on your cheeks also looks a bit like blood, which makes your skin look thinner,\u201d Park says, dabbing lightly. \u201cBabies have very thin skin.\u201d Believe it or not, Park\u2019s signature look can be achieved in just five minutes, using the same techniques he delivers to stars like Doona Bae. \u201cIt\u2019s so simple,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd with this skin, when you smile, you glow even more.\u201d What better look to take with you into party season\u2014and beyond?
