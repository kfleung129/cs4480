Healthline only shows you brands and products that we stand behind. To tone or not to tone? In the world of K-beauty, the former is a requirement. For years, dermatologists and estheticians in the United States have gone back and forth on whether swabbing our face with a toner-soaked cotton ball is helpful or harmful to skin health. But this argument isn\u2019t about toners \u2014 it\u2019s about alcohol in the toners. It\u2019s a common belief that toners with alcohol are an essential step to killing acne-causing bacteria, but it\u2019s also a double-edged sword. Though alcohol does fight bacteria, it also strips the skin of moisture. \u201cAlcohol actually dries your skin out, which makes issues like acne even worse,\u201d says Coco Pai, a licensed esthetician with over 25 years of experience and the owner of CoCo Spa in San Francisco, CA. This may be why some dermatologists say toners aren\u2019t necessary, but there\u2019s one important distinction to make: Not all toners have their roots in alcohol. Korean beauty, or more commonly popularized K-beauty, does not. You may have heard of the Korean beauty skin care regimen that has 10 steps: cleansing, cleansing again, exfoliating, toning, tapping in essence, applying treatments, masking, using eye cream, moisturizing, and slathering on sun protection. K-Beauty toners fit in this skin care sequence as a step to maximize great skin results. Whether you already ritually perform each of these steps or are just learning about Korean skin care, don\u2019t skimp on your toner knowledge. Here are the reasons that solidify toner\u2019s place in K-Beauty and why you\u2019ll want to pay attention to this beneficial step in your skin journey. Also called lotions, K-Beauty toners are rich in ingredients that hydrate skin rather than rid it of moisture. You can find ingredients like kelp extract, mineral water, amino acids, hyaluronic acid, grapeseed oil, and carrot root oil in K-Beauty toners. But can you beat acne-causing bacteria without the alcohol? Definitely. There are many other, more calming ways to fight breakouts. K-Beauty toners rely on extracts like propolis and chamomile, which naturally keep bacteria at bay without shifting the skin\u2019s pH. But more importantly, the many steps in a K-Beauty skin care routine also offer more opportunities to banish bacteria. \u201cToners are critical after the double cleanse because they remove any impurities your cleansers didn\u2019t catch,\u201d says Charlotte Cho, a licensed esthetician and founder of Soko Glam, an online destination for Korean beauty products. Cho is also the author of \u201cThe Little Book of Skin Care: Korean Beauty Secrets for Healthy, Glowing Skin.\u201d These aforementioned moisturizing ingredients are important because they restore the skin\u2019s pH. Your skin\u2019s natural pH is around 5.5. But pollution, oil production, makeup, and alcohol can shift your skin\u2019s state, hence its pH. K-Beauty toners, on the other hand, mimic the skin\u2019s natural pH. Most have a pH ranging from 5.0 to 5.5, according to Pai. By applying K-Beauty toners directly to the skin, you encourage skin to maintain its balanced state. \u201cIf skin is not at a balanced pH level, it becomes prone to the cycle of excessive dryness followed by too much oil production, and even environmental damage,\u201d says Pai. \u201cThink of your skin like a sponge,\u201d says Cho. \u201cIt\u2019s more difficult to rehydrate it when it\u2019s dried up than when it\u2019s already a bit damp. Essence, treatments, and moisturizers will be more fully absorbed when prepped with toner than when the skin is dry.\u201d Pai adds that when you have dry skin, products like serums, masks, and moisturizers will just sit on top of this layer of dead skin. \u201cAlcohol actually dries your skin out more, which makes this problem worse,\u201d she says. \u201cBut when skin is hydrated and at a balanced pH after applying toner, other products can penetrate the skin.\u201d \u201cYou want to choose a K-Beauty toner that has the right ingredients for your specific skin type,\u201d suggests Cho. For example, dryer skin benefits from humectants, like hyaluronic acid, which bind moisture to your skin. Oily types, on the other hand, will want a formula that\u2019s more lightweight and less emollient in texture. Here are some of our favorites: If you choose to purchase from retailers like Amazon, always watch out for counterfeit products. You can spot fakes by paying close attention to a product\u2019s rating and customer reviews. Look for those with high ratings and positive reviews that confirm authenticity. Not all toners are created equal \u2014 but not all American toners are bad either. While many brands in the United States may have a bad rap due to their moisture-stripping properties, some manufacturers have caught on to produce mists that work for more sensitive skin. For example, you can try rose water sprays, which are known to help rebalance your skin\u2019s pH. In the world of K-Beauty, toners are seen as a must-have for healthy, balanced skin.
