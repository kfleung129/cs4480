    "title": "Why dewy skin became an international obsession",
    "text": "\u201cI never knew I wanted to look dewy until social media told me I should look dewy,\u201d a colleague declared recently. Indeed, scroll through Instagram and you\u2019ll be greeted with endless variations of essentially the same luminous #skingoal. There\u2019s \u201cglass skin,\u201d described by Charlotte Cho, founder of the K-beauty retail site Soko Glam, as a \u201cclear, poreless, translucent complexion\u201d; \u201choney skin\u201d; \u201ccloudless skin\u201d; \u201cyoga skin\u201d; and the highlighter-happy \u201cdewy dumpling\u201d look. It\u2019s a major pivot: For decades, magazines and the beauty industry conditioned women to believe that shine was the enemy, with pressed powder, blotting papers, and mattifying gels their chief weapons in the battle against oil. And just a few years ago, the reigning Instagram aesthetic involved heavy makeup and contouring, a technique popularized by Kim Kardashian West that uses shading to create the impression of sharper cheekbones and more angular features. So how did the lightweight dewy look become de rigueur? The Korean Wave and the ascent of athleisure are just two of the trends that have converged to convince women around the world they need to get that glow. The story of dewy skin\u2019s rise to Insta-fame begins with the same country that introduced the world to joy of boy bands like BTS and EXO: South Korea. With South Korea\u2019s cultural influence on the rise thanks to its wildly popular music and soap operas, its beauty standards have also gained international currency. Central to the current Korean beauty ideal is chok chok: A moist, softly gleaming complexion, achieved through a dedicated skin-care routine. Alicia Yoon, founder of the Korean beauty retail site Peach & Lily, tells Quartz that when she was growing up in South Korea in the 1990s, \u201cthe beauty look was a more matte, fluffy, powdery, mochi-skin look.\u201d In the early 2000s, the trend began to shift toward a more dewy finish. \u201cWhen I spoke to Kowonhye, one of Korea\u2019s top makeup artists, she shared that she was one of the pioneers of that movement,\u201d Yoon writes via email. \u201cShe was on set one day doing makeup for a big TV show, and with TV becoming more high-definition, she thought a dewier, more natural finish would look better on screen.\u201d Other makeup artists began to embrace the look, which then trickled down to everyday consumers. Korean beauty companies capitalized on the desire for the dewy look by peddling \u201cskin care as makeup.\u201d The desired glow could be obtained via toners, serums, exfoliants, oils, and moisturizers, along with exercise, plenty of sleep, and a healthy diet. Korean makeup, too, evolved toward products that accentuated the skin\u2019s natural sheen rather than covering it up. Yoon cites BB Cream, \u201cwhich provides decent coverage but is supposed to look like \u2018second skin\u2019 without a powdery foundation,\u201d and \u201ccushion compacts,\u201d which provide similarly light coverage. By the early 2010s, Korean beauty products, already popular in China and other Asian markets, were gaining momentum in the West. Charlotte Cho, founder of the K-beauty site Soko Glam, gave interviews to US women\u2019s magazines that helped popularize a 10-step Korean skin-care routine, while YouTube vlogs, Reddit forums, and Instagram selfies and \u201cshelfies\u201d helped spread the good word about how to get glowy skin, providing enticing photo evidence to boot. The appeal of K-beauty lay not just in the promised results of radiant, chok-chok skin, but in the price point. \u201cKorean skin-care products tended to be more affordable than what one can buy at Sephora while seeming cooler than drugstore products available anywhere,\u201d beauty journalist Tracy E. Robey told Vox\u2019s Alex Abad-Santos. Sephora itself jumped on the bandwagon; by 2011, it was selling K-beauty products, too. The dewy look\u2014and the K-beauty products that promise to confer it\u2014has been unstoppable ever since. Target and CVS stores each launched dedicated K-beauty sections in 2017, both curated by Peach & Lily\u2019s Yoon. In 2018, Korean cosmetics exports totaled $6.3 billion, according to the latest government data, an annual jump of 27% and the seventh straight year of double-digit growth. Western brands have also gotten in on the action, with plenty of skin-care and cosmetic products designed to help consumers achieve their desired level of glow. There are no less than 255 highlighting products on Sephora\u2019s site, including options from Marc Jacobs, Nars, Dior, Benefit, and Fenty Beauty by Rihanna. Perhaps the single most-influential Western company when it comes to the dewy-skin trend is the minimalist beauty brand Glossier. Founded in 2014 by Emily Weiss, a former Vogue assistant and beauty blogger, Glossier has achieved a valuation of $1.2 billion in large part thanks to savvy social-media marketing with an explicit focus on \u201cglowy, dewy skin.\u201d As the company\u2019s name suggests, Glossier\u2019s products\u2014and vocabulary\u2014seem to emerge from the founding principle that women\u2019s faces should reflect more light than a solar panel. Peruse its makeup and skin-care pages, and you\u2019ll find \u201cglassy lip gloss,\u201d \u201cdew effect highlighter,\u201d \u201cglistening eye glow,\u201d \u201csuper glow\u201d serum and body creams that promise \u201cglowy, dewy hydration.\u201d A 2018 profile of Weiss in New York magazine took Glossier\u2019s dewiness obsession to its logical conclusion, featuring photos of the founder looking drenched and so shiny that her cheekbones look likely to cause glare. As Autumn Whitefield-Madrano, author of Face Value: The Hidden Ways Beauty Shapes Women\u2019s Lives, tells Quartz, it makes sense that Glossier swept the millennial and Gen Z markets just as the contouring trend\u2014with its complicated shading methods and layers of makeup\u2014reached its Instagrammable peak. A glowing aesthetic was the perfect counter to what Whitefield-Madrano calls the \u201cprogrammed and stylized and unachievable,\u201d heavily-made-up beauty trends that played to the camera and looked theatrical in daylight. Indeed, contouring has long been associated with performance; actors in Elizabethan England smeared chalk and soot on their face. Just as young people got fed up with Instagrammers who produce perfectly arranged, color-coordinated grids and clearly staged shots, so too did the cultural pendulum swing toward looks that appeared less affected. As New York magazine notes, Glossier is sometimes described as \u201cmakeup for people who are already pretty.\u201d That\u2019s not necessarily a criticism. The idea of using makeup to accentuate one\u2019s features, rather than transform them, is central to its appeal. The Glossier aesthetic looks good on Instagram, sure, but no one looks like they\u2019re trying too hard. The gleam on the tip of a Glossier fan\u2019s nose could be Haloscope, or simply a trick of the light. There\u2019s also a connection to be drawn to the rise of athleisure. A slightly shiny complexion is as much a fashion statement as a pair of color-blocked Outdoor Voices leggings. Both communicate that fitness has been so well-integrated into your lifestyle that you always appear to be on your way back from barre class. \u201cShininess implies radiance and health and inner vitality,\u201d Whitefield-Madrano observes. \u201cIt is sort of weird that matte has been the standard for so long. Matte implies that you\u2019re not moving.\u201d For a long time, sitting still and not moving was a sign of privilege, while breaking a sweat was for the plebes. It\u2019s only in the past few decades that exercise has acquired the glow of righteousness, tied up, as Jia Tolentino writes in an essay on Outdoor Voices for The New Yorker, with one\u2019s ability to \u201ccompete in a culture of escalating beauty expectations and increasingly boundless work.\u201d Yoon notes, \u201cI do think in the US, a rising awareness of wellness and how to do self-care the right way leads to conversations about how to care for skin and ultimately, hydration, which often times can translate to dewy skin, comes up as that\u2019s such a foundational pillar for skin health.\u201d And because people who have the time, energy, and ability to prioritize exercise tend to lead privileged lifestyles, glowing skin that speaks of your commitment to wellness culture may be the ultimate status symbol. Dewy skin, in essence, is a sign that you\u2019re doing a lot of other things right, too: Exercising at least three times a week and drinking eight glasses of water a day and eating your lean proteins and vegetables and wearing sunscreen and avoiding alcohol and going to bed early and maybe seeing a dermatologist and getting facials. A dewy person is a healthy person. Dew communicates, much like the Lululemons that Moira Weigel writes about in a recent essay for Real Life Magazine, that you\u2019re \u201cengaging in constant self-management.\u201d If you\u2019re disciplined enough, everyone will be able to see how good you\u2019ve been; your inner glow will be made manifest. Further buoying the dewy-skin trend is a cultural backlash against the term \u201canti-aging,\u201d as Morwenna Ferrier writes in The Guardian. Some women\u2019s magazines, including Allure and Elle, have banned the phrase from their pages. Allure editor-in-chief Michelle Lee explains that, given the inevitability of mortality for all living creatures, she objects to the idea that \u201caging is a condition we need to battle.\u201d At the same time, brands like Kiehl\u2019s began avoiding language about fine lines and wrinkles in favor of euphemisms like \u201cradiance.\u201d This evolution is particularly pronounced in newer brands that target millennials. Vox\u2019s Cheryl Wischhover points to two Vitamin C products\u2014Drunk Elephant\u2019s C Firma and Skinceuticals CE Ferulic\u2014that contain similar active ingredients, but use markedly different language in their branding. Skinceuticals mentions \u201caging\u201d or \u201canti-aging\u201d 15 times on its website; the Drunk Elephant page on Sephora omits such concerns entirely, focusing instead on \u201cradiance\u201d and \u201cluminosity.\u201d As Wischhover explains, putting people on a quest for dewy skin is a way for the beauty industry to soften ageist rhetoric while keeping the underlying youthful ideal intact. While changing the language around aging isn\u2019t the same thing as accepting wrinkles, Whitefield-Madrano says that\u2019s an improvement: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be buying this stuff anyway, I would rather buy something that has positive connotation than a negative one.\u201d In a recent article for The New York Times, Euny Hong, author of The Birth of Korean Cool, suggested that the Western fascination with Korean skin care has a tinge of Orientalism to it, noting that the luxury brand Sulwhasoo \u201cadvertises its products as containing \u201cKorean herbal medicine drawn from Asian wisdom.\u201d That\u2019s a fair assessment. Yet the rise of K-beauty and the dewy-skin look can also be attributed to the close scrutiny to which all women\u2019s faces are subjected. Women live in a world that\u2019s at once eager to scan their faces for wrinkles, acne, redness, freckles, scars, dry patches, and other signs of humanity, and ferociously critical of makeup that conceals or minimizes the features they\u2019re told are flaws. In this sense, the dewy look may be the ultimate armor for women. It feeds into the perennial dream of no-makeup makeup, which allows the wearer to present a natural-looking yet enviably flawless front to the world\u2014or better yet, a face so immaculate and reflective of one\u2019s inner goodness that there is nothing to feel ashamed of or conceal. It\u2019s fitting that many of the terms for dewy skin\u2014\u201cglass skin,\u201d \u201choney skin\u201d\u2014aspire to mimic surfaces that are smooth and glossy and poreless, and not really much like skin at all.
