Lee Seung Chul expressed his excitement on Twitter (translated): \u201cWow, No. 1 on Billboard K-pop Hot 100. What an honor! Thank you my fans!\u201d ??~??? k-pop?? 1? ????????????? ?? ??????? !!!!!!!!!!! ? ??? ????????^^ \u2014 LEE SEUNGCHUL(???) (@Lee_SeungChul) June 28, 2013 Last week, SISTAR charted ten songs on the K-Pop Hot 100 including occupying the top three slots with comeback single \u201cGive It to Me\u201d being crowned at No. 1. The single falls to No. 2 this week, leaving \u201cGive It to Me\u201d only one week at the top. Watch one of SISTAR\u2019s latest burlesque-inspired performances below:  Last week saw seven Top 10 entries featuring girl groups or girl group members. They all fall this week, except for After School\u2019s \u201cFirst Love,\u201d\u00a0which\u00a0rises to No. 7 \u2014 a new peak for the \u201990s hip-hop/R&B-inspired single. Two of the eight members are still injured from their risky, yet truly impressive, pole-dancing live performance. Watch one of their latest below:   Quirky, yet very popular, act Sunny Hill recently returned with a new single, \u201cDarling of All Hearts,\u201d this week\u2019s Hot Shot Debut. The folksy, polka single tells the downsides of being single, but through lighthearted, funny lyrics. The composition includes instruments such as Greek bouzouki, nyckelharpa, Drehleier and the Irish Whistle \u2014 rarely heard in K-pop. The fresh instrumentation and the funny lyrics add up to yet another innovative release from the group that\u2019s dropped singles about the dark side of the K-pop industry in their acid jazz track \u201cMidnight Circus\u201d\u00a0and the vainness in looking for relationships in their electro-pop banger \u201cIs the White Horse Coming?\u201d. Watch the Sunny Hill girls play up an old-school pin-up theme in the music video:  Next week should see even more girl groups joining the chart battle as it reflects a full week\u2019s worth of sales from Girl\u2019s Day (\u201cFemale President,\u201d starting at No. 22) and 4minute (\u201cIs It Poppin\u2019?\u201d).
