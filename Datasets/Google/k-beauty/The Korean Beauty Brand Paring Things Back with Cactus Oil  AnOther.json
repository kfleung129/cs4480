    "text": "Who is it? Korean brand Huxley\u2019s less-is-more approach offers an alternative to the upwards of ten-step routines that K-beauty\u00a0has become known for. Huxley favours timelessness, holistically: its founder Hoon Lee named the brand after Aldous, his favourite writer (\u201cLike Huxley predicted, in the future, there is so much information out there that it\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s true and what\u2019s false,\u201d Lee told W Magazine) and makes a point of not chasing trends when it comes to developing and releasing products. Huxley\u2019s roster of creams, essences, toners and masks currently numbers at less than 30, a testament to the strength of its collection \u2013 as is its popularity, both in- and outside of Korea (where it is apparently a favourite among perfectly complexioned flight attendants). \u201cWhen it comes to K-Beauty, most people tend to think about an elaborate ten-step skincare routine combined with exotic ingredients \u2013 snail mucin, for example \u2013 and kitsch packaging,\u201d says Jin Kwon, founder of TONIC15, Huxley\u2019s sole distributor in the UK. \u201cThere are more than 20,000 beauty brands currently competing in Korea and multiple beauty stores on every street,\u201d she continues of the \u201cincredibly fast-paced\u201d industry. Where Huxley sets itself apart, then, is through its minimalism of both product (its ingredients and range) and appearance (chic, sparse labelling). Why do I want it? Impressing the Korean beauty consumer \u2013\u00a0who Kwon describes as \u201cincredibly well educated and savvy when it comes to ingredients and formulations\u201d \u2013 is no mean feat in such a saturated industry, but Huxley\u2019s natural, cruelty-free and organic approach has resulted in cult products. The star ingredient? Prickly pear seed oil. The succulent\u2019s essential oil is rich in Vitamin E and fatty acids, but is lighter on the skin than argan or coconut oil. \u201cThe Vitamin E in prickly pear seed oil is a super antioxidant that protects and repairs the skin. It also protects against free-radical exposure which damages skin\u2019s collagen and results in dryness, fine lines and wrinkles,\u201d says Kwon. \u201cLinoleic acid, an essential fatty acid in the prickly pear seed oil, has anti-inflammatory, acne-reductive and moisture-retentive properties.\u201d Such properties\u00a0are exemplified in the brand\u2019s oil and extract set sheet mask, which combines the oils and essences of the plant to create an intensely hydrating, and long-lasting, formula. (The actual mixing of the two is left to the customer: stored in separate halves of a plastic pouch, the oil bursts in to mix with the essence after a series of folds creates pressure and pushes them together.) This cactus oil is at the heart of each of Huxley\u2019s products, and has proven key to its popularity (the brand holds exclusive rights to the use of Moroccan prickly pear seed oil in Korea). Simultaneously nourishing and barely there on the skin, the intense moisturisation is just what\u2019s needed as winter sets in. The temptation may be to pile on the products, but \u2013 while the formulations are buildable \u2013\u00a0not much is needed to feel the effects: apply a pea-sized amount of Huxley\u2019s Good Night sleep mask for glowy hydration come morning; a few drops of the uniquely formulated Oil Essence: Essence-Like, Oil-Like adds a weightless layer of moisture underneath a cream. The prickly pear seed oil lends a clean scent to each product too, that falls somewhere between cucumber and grass in its freshness. Where can I get it? Online at\u00a0TONIC15 and in store at Harvey Nichols. ",
