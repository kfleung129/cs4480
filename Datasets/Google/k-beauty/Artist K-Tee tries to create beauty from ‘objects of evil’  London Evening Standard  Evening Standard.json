    "text": "News | London An artist has created sculptures inspired by deadly weapons in a bid to make them \u201cbeautiful\u201d. The fibreglass objects \u2014 which are 2ft tall \u2014 were modelled on US hand grenades used during the Second World War. K-Tee, an artist from Hemel Hempstead, was commissioned to make them by celebrity art dealer and presenter Jeff Salmon. The most expensive of the works, which cost between \u00a33,500 and \u00a38,000, features 11,000 Swarovski crystals in a camouflage pattern. Salmon, who presents Channel 4\u2019s auction programme Four Rooms, said: \u201cLast year I was watching a CNN bulletin about the troubles in Syria. I wanted to see if hand grenades could \u2018de-evilised\u2019 and I got K-Tee to see if she could come up with one of her wonderful concepts.\u201d He said since going on display at Decoratum, his gallery in Marylebone, they have caused a \u201cmassive stir\u201d. K-Tee, 36, who also works as a prop maker for Hollywood films, helped to make the guns used by Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt in their movie Edge of Tomorrow. \u201cIt was all about taking what is an object of evil and flipping it on its head and turning it into something completely different,\u201d she said. \u201cClearly hand grenades really should not exist at all, like anything which kills other human beings. My aim was to make use of these objects and turn them into something beautiful.\u201d Clingy fans should let Doja Cat wear what she wants Future of Hipgnosis founder Mercuriadis in doubt as board launches strategic review Mat Collishaw: Petrichor at Kew: old and new warped to unsettling effect Will England have enough to get past the Springboks?
