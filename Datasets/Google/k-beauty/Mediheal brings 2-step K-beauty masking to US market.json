Based in Seoul, South Korea, L&P itself got its start in 1969 (and was until 2009 known as Wangsang Chemicals). And according to this month\u2019s press release announcing the Mediheal US launch, L&P \u201cwas recently awarded Korea's Presidential Industrial Service Medal for job creation and is consistently noted for its efforts to increase and improve the quality of jobs in South Korea.\u201d\u200b Global expansion\u200b Mediheal products are sold in some 30+ countries; and the brand\u2019s product portfolio isn\u2019t limited to masks alone but to facial skin care more broadly. Still, the brand calculated its entry into the US market carefully. \u201cAs the K-Beauty phenomenon spread globally, many Korean beauty brands rushed to the US market,\u201d\u200b points out Sunjoo Lee, CEO of Mediheal US, who goes on to explain that, \u201cWe waited until we understood the market enough to offer the right products and chose distribution partners who embraced our core value - making the most cutting-edge, effective beauty products accessible to all.\u201d\u200b Masking innovation\u200b Clay masks, sheet masks, patches, and the like have gone through any number of trendy iterations\u2014for the sake of Instagram, for the sake of partnerships with Disney and Marvel Comics, for any number of ventures that had little (or nothing) to do with effective skin care formulations or applications. Mediheal is one of the brands positioning itself, not in opposition to this masking craze exactly but as a skin care leader with an expertise in mask materials, production, formulation, and skin care product application. \u201cMediheal turned the sheet mask from a promotional novelty item into its own specialized and advanced skincare product, considered an essential part of anyone's daily routine,\u201d \u200basserts Kwon Oh-sub, CEO of L&P Cosmetic and founder of Mediheal. \u201cWe've shown the industry,\u201d \u200bhe says in the company\u2019s recent press release that, \u201cthat sheet masks can become more innovative and can quickly (but effectively) address skin concerns according to an individual's specific needs.\u201d\u200b Building reputation \u200b The brand is now retailing at select Walgreens as well as on the pharmacy chain\u2019s ecommerce site, and of course on MedihealUS.com. By November, the brand expects to be in over 1,000 more Walgreens locations across the States. And, Mediheal is banking on product quality, craftsmanship, and efficacy so far as that can help build loyal consumers and further retail partnerships. \u201cAll of our masks are made from the highest quality ingredients,\u201d \u200bsays Young Sook Lee, the brand\u2019s global head of R&D and production, adding, \u201cWhat distinguishes us from the rest of the category is our groundbreaking process. We take extra care in making sure our mask packs are made through rigorous, automated processes so that we can pack the essences, ampoules, and masks into one safe and clean package.\u201d\u200b --- Deanna Utroske, CosmeticsDesign.com Editor, covers beauty business news in the Americas region and publishes the weekly Indie Beauty Profile column, showcasing the inspiring work of entrepreneurs and innovative brands.
