    "text": "It is the first foray into brick-and-mortar retail for the K-beauty purveyor. Beauty Editor, Mass Market Soko Glam is setting up shop in Bloomingdale\u2019s. The digital K-beauty company\u00a0has opened a temporary pop-in shop on the cosmetics floor of the retailer\u2019s SoHo outpost. The space holds 11 brands and 70 K-beauty skin-care and makeup products, and is equipped with iPads that display a revolving stream of how-to content featuring Soko Glam\u2019s cofounder and chief curator Charlotte Cho. \u201cWe identify as a totally digital company, and we have this e-commerce community with thousands of reviews, and it was our community that really wanted us to have this in-person experience,\u201d said Cho of the Bloomingdale\u2019s shop, Soko Glam\u2019s first-ever retail concept. American-born Cho, a licensed aesthetician, founded Soko Glam in 2012 after getting hooked on Korean skin care while living in South Korea for the first time in her early 20s. Today, Soko Glam operates as both an e-commerce site and K-beauty blog called The Klog, which focuses on education around Korean skin-care routines.

This is the perfect target audience for K-beauty,\u201d said Stacie Borteck, vice president and DMM of cosmetics and fragrances at Bloomingdale\u2019s. Cho emphasized that the shop is designed to make K-beauty accessible to consumers who only know it for gimmicky items like animal sheet masks or complex 12-step routines. \u201cThere are a lot of misconceptions about Korean skin care being complicated, but it\u2019s really about what your skin needs what concerns you have,\u201d Cho said. To that end, the store is organized by a streamlined five-step routine, and the sheet mask wall is divided into sections based on specific skin concerns. Three iPads on each wall of the shop demonstrate a revolving stream of how-to content, featuring Cho herself applying products. Products in the shop range from $2 to $50, an accessible price point Cho thinks will resonate with younger consumers looking to experiment with new skin-care items. She expects bestsellers to reflect what sells well in her e-commerce shop, including the Etude House Moistfull Collagen Emulsion, Neogen Dermalogy Bio-Peel Gauze in Peeling Wine \u2014 they\u2019re peel pads steeped in resveratrol and lactic acid \u2014 and the Cosrx Acne Pimple Master patches, which are sticker spot treatments for acne. Cho also chose to carry makeup from Etude House and Klavuu, something most K-beauty purveyors in the U.S. have shied away from. \u201cI really think makeup is part of the next K-beauty wave,\u201d said Cho, who noted that color trends in South Korea are becoming increasingly Westernized, sparking product development of American-friendly makeup products. The shop is also social-media friendly \u2014 shoppers who post to social media and tag @sokoglam are given product samples. And new content and products will be continuously rotated in, keeping the shop current at all times. \u201cThis goes along with how retail isn\u2019t straightforward anymore and people want that personalized experience,\u201d said Cho, who noted she\u2019ll see how the pop-in fares at Bloomingdale\u2019s before considering further retail expansion.
