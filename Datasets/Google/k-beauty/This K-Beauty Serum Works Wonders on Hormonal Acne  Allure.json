    "text": "By Sara Spruch-Feiner When we think about hormonal acne, images of dermatologists and prescription pills come to mind. But one writer says she\u2019s got hers under control with this K-beauty brand\u2019s serum (which is conveniently available at your local Sephora). \u201cIn the morning, even my deepest, reddest, most under-the-skin blemishes have significantly improved and then disappear within about 48 hours,\u201d Popsugar writer Madison Meltzer says. In fact, we\u2019ve sung its praises here on Allure before too. The product in question is Dr. Jart\u2019s Cipacair Tiger Grass Re.Pair serum, and it\u2019s just what you need when you\u2019re about to hit the panic button on your complexion. The main ingredient is centella asiatica, an herbaceous plant that\u2019s been used for centuries to calm angry skin (the folklore goes that Asian tigers are known to roll around in it to get the most of its soothing properties). And now, we too can reap its benefits. Dr. Jart\u2019s taken the extract and combined it with a mineral solution containing copper, zinc, and selenium to create a soothing serum that forms a protective barrier over the skin. Centella asiatica is also rich in chlorophyll, which gives plants their energy. Gentle enough to be used daily, you can slather your face in this stuff. It\u2019s lightweight too, so you\u2019ll likely want to apply your regular moisturizer on top. You can expect to see rosacea, acne, and general sensitivity calmed. You only need a small drop of the pale green liquid to cover most of your face, too. Angry skin \u2014 rejoice! \"The longer I've used it, the more it's become a spot treatment rather than a part of my nightly routine,\" Meltzer writes, \"it's that good.\" If your skin loves this natural extract as much as Meltzer's, you'll be pleased to know it's one of four products in the Dr. Jart line that harnesses its power.\nThere's a cream, a color correcting treatment, and a pack of 30 individual packettes of an overnight mask. Of course, what worked for Meltzer won\u2019t calm everyone\u2019s hormonal acne, but for under $50, it's certainly worth a try!
