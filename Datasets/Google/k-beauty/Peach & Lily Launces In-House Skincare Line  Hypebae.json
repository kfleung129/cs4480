    "text": "Cult K-beauty retailer Peach & Lily has officially launched its in-house skincare line. Since the digital company is known for serving up the most innovative products of-the-moment, it goes without saying that some of the debut products have already sold out. The lineup consists of a Glass Skin Refining Serum, a Pure Beam Luxe Oil, a Matcha Pudding Antioxidant Cream and an Original Glow Mask Set featuring 20 masks. Two of the uber-popular items which have sold out on QVC are the Glass Skin Refining Serum and the Original Glow Sheet Mask. The serum is made up of a mixture of mainly peach extract and peptide complex which both hydrates, calms and brightens the skin, while the mask provides an original glow thanks to built-in antioxidants. To purchase Peach & Lily\u2019s debut skincare line, head over to the brand\u2019s web store. Pricing starts at $39 USD. Additionally, the drop includes a Super Reboot Resurfacing Mask which doesn\u2019t have a release date yet.
