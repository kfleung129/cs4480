    "text": "Billboard chart highlights from the K-Pop Hot 100 and beyond featuring Park Hyo Shin, Apink, Girls' Generation, Mad Clown, Super Junior-M, B.A.P, Crayon Pop, 2NE1, PSY, MBLAQ and more. By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJeff Benjamin Male solo singer Park Hyo Shin clinches the No. 1 spot on the K-Pop Hot 100 this week with his new ballad \u201cWild Flower,\u201d dethroning last week\u2019s chart topper by K-pop legend Lee Sun Hee. Considered by many as one of Korea\u2019s top male vocalists,\u00a0Park Hyo Shin was out of the spotlight for four years due to South Korea\u2019s two-year mandatory military service as well as a nasty contract dispute with his former agency.  After a few delays, the singer has released his highly anticipated comeback single on March 28, under Jellyfish Entertainment \u2014 home to Sung Shi Kyung and VIXX \u2014 and proved the promise of his killer pipes as he conquered various K-pop music chart TV programs without any major promotions. The ballad is about overcoming turmoil and difficulties, using wild flowers as a metaphor.

The K-pop veteran later revealed that he stripped out the 50-piece orchestra from the original track to fully deliver the sincerity of the lyrics. \u201cWild Flower\u201d at No. 1 means girl group Apink settles for the No. 2 slot with their new single \u201cMr. Chu.\u201d Should the new single not rise higher than the runner-up slot, it would be the adorable sextet\u2019s second No. 2-peaking single in a year\u2019s time, following \u201cNoNoNo\u201d released in July.  Continuing Apink\u2019s slew of bubblegum-pop singles, \u201cMr. Chu\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily push Apink into new or unexplored territory. Rather, \u201cMr. Chu\u201d seems to be a way to try to futher solidify themselves as K-pop\u2019s ultimate sweethearts. As Girls\u2019 Generation continue to evolve and show a more mature side of themselves, Apink seem ready to be the spritely, smiley girl group who wouldn\u2019t dare to touch a sexy concept like so many other female acts today. Following Apink is two former No. 1s: Last week\u2019s chart topper, Lee Sun Hee\u2019s \u201cDuring That Meet Your\u201d (below), slips to the No. 3 position in its second week on the chart; Plus \u201cSome,\u201d the collaboration between SISTAR\u2019s Soyou, Junggigo and Lil Boi of Geeks that ruled the chart for a record-tying seven weeks.  Following the success of last year\u2019s collaboration track \u201cStupid in Love\u201d with SISTAR\u2019s Soyou \u2014 which\u00a0hit No. 1 in September\u00a0\u2014\u00a0rapper Mad Clown released his 2nd EP \u201cFerocity\u201d on April 4. The lead single \u201cWithout You\u201d (below) features SISTAR\u2019s lead vocalist Hyorin and is the Hot Shot Debut this week at No. 5. The hip-hop ballad about the hardships of a breakup is heightened by Mad Clown\u2019s signature fiery spitting skills and Hyorin\u2019s smoky vocals. In the music video, model Cho Min Ho is portrayed as completely distraught man reminiscing about his past relationship. Will another pairing between Mad Clown and a SISTAR member snag a No. 1?  The chart\u2019s second highest debut belongs to Crayon Pop, who return to the Top 10 of the K-Pop Hot 100 with \u201cUh-ee.\u201d The energetic new single is the quintet\u2019s best showing since their viral hit \u201cBar Bar Bar\u201d reigned atop the K-Pop chart for a week in 2013.
