Speaking to ConfectioneryNews at Vitafoods in Geneva, Adrian Sagman, vice president of international sales and marketing at Carmit said:\u200b\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a milk chocolate for children on a daily basis to get some calcium in their body.\u200b \u201cThis one also has a tooth-friendly sugar ingredient so the parents don\u2019t have to worry about their kids taking too much sugar.\u201d \u200bThe product is sweetened with evaporated cane juice, palatinose. Asked why the company chose coins, he said it already had the technology to produce this format. \u201cThis way it is portion controlled, it\u2019s foiled and keeps for a fresh format.\u201d \u200bHe added the chocolate could also be made in bar or slab form. Calcium and vitamin content\u200b Each 6 g milk chocolate coin contains 150 mg of calcium. According to the Food and Nutrition Board, the recommended dietary allowance\u200b (RDA) for children aged 4-8 is 1,000 mg or 1,300 mg for those aged 9-18. Calcium has a string of European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)\u00a0authorized\u00a0health claims including \u2018energy-yielding metabolism\u2019 and \u2018muscle function\u2019 when a product is a \u2018source of calcium.\u2019 To be a\u00a0\u00a0\u2018source of calcium\u2019\u200b a product must contain 15% of an 800 mg recommended daily allowance per 100g \u2013 which is 120 mg. Carmit\u2019s coin also contains Vitamin D3 which aids calcium absorption. There is 5 mcg of vitamin D3 and 15 mcg of vitamin K in each coin. The EU has set the RDA for vitamin D at 5 mcg. The Food and Nutrition Board has set the recommended dietary allowance for Vitamin K at 55 mcg for 4-8 year olds, 60 mcg for 9-13 year olds and 75 for 14 to 18 year olds. Beauty chocolate: Antioxidant coins\u200b Carmit Candy\u2019s \u00a0\u2018Antioxidant-Rich Dark Chocolate Coins\u2019 use the \u2019beauty\u2019 ingredient Astapure from Algatechnologies. AstaPure is a form of astaxanthin, which Algatechnologies\u00a0derives from red algae grown in Israel. \u201cOn its own it tastes like seaweed \u2013 but we mask it and dark chocolate is a very good way to mask it.\u201d\u200b A series of attempts have been made to win an\u00a0authorized\u00a0health claim for astaxanthin including for beneficial effect on the immune system, blood cholesterol and joint maintenance, but all have been rejected. Each coin contains 1 mg of the ingredient. Sagman said that two coins were needed to get the desired effect. He said the product was for adults so the firm decided to sweeten the product with sugar, but added that a sugar-free version was possible.
