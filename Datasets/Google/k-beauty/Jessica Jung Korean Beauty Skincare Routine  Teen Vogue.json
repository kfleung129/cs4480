    "text": "By Sarah Wu As beauty trends go, K-beauty isn\u2019t particularly known for lending itself to a pared-down routine. Cool and innovative? Definitely. Time-saving? Usually, not so much. After all, it\u2019s the movement that brought us the 11-step skincare routine, which isn\u2019t exactly conducive to sleeping in. We will say, though, that K-beauty never fails to deliver amazing results, which is why we\u2019re always looking to the pros for the latest products and hacks we have to know. So when Jessica Jung took to Vogue\u2019s YouTube to share her (16-step!) routine, we were instantly mesmerized. Who better to break it down than a K-pop star and beauty guru, right? Here\u2019s what we learned after watching her go through her morning routine: it\u2019s heavy on skincare from a brand called Blanc & Eclare, which stocks K-beauty standbys like sheet masks and ampoules. We also now know that it\u2019s totally encouraged \u2013 especially for those who long to live like K-pop royalty \u2013 to start your day by spraying your favorite skin mist liberally, and not just on your face! \u201cOn flights or where it\u2019s really dry, I spray it all over the place,\u201d she explains. Her makeup leans toward subtle, neutral shades that are easy to apply and basically impossible to mess up. A few of her favorites include the budge-proof L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris Colour Riche Eyeliner in Black, NARS Blush in Miss Liberty, and Giorgio Armani Rouge Ecstasy Express Moisture Rich Lipcolor in Flesh. In other words, there\u2019s a nice balance of drugstore and high-end, so you don\u2019t have to worry about splurging too much if you see something you like. Check out the video for the rest of her beauty hacks! We might not be incorporating all 16 into our daily rotations, but thanks to the rising temps, we\u2019ll definitely be trying that skin mist tip ASAP.
