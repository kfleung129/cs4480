Who among us, really, isn't constantly striving for\u00a0Kardashian-level lashes? And to get there, we all have torture chambers' worth\u00a0of eyelash-curling\u00a0devices in our beauty bags. But none are as interesting as what Korean women\u2014AKA our makeup messiahs\u2014have dreamed up as a hack. In an interview with\u00a0Byrdie,\u00a0Insider Beauty\u00a0founder\u00a0Angela Kim revealed that the latest K-beauty trick\u00a0entails cutting off the two ends of a wood\u00a0Q-tip, heating up the remaining\u00a0stick with the flame from a lighter, and then using it to \"lift\" the lashes from below. Note: A regular Q-tip with a cardboard or plastic stick will be, um, a bit of a fire hazard, so make sure you use the wood kind. When Byrdie's\u00a0editor put it to the test, she found that when used in tandem with a traditional, stainless steel curler, as well as mascara, it was like a push-up bra for her lashes that lasted all day. Enticing, no? It was like a push-up bra for her lashes that lasted all day. And confession: Eyelash curlers, particularly electric ones, kind of freak me out. They\u00a0make\u00a0me feel like I'm one spastic movement away from losing every last lash. (Not unlike\u00a0Miley's recent misfortune\u2014yikes.)\u00a0So even though this involves heat, its non-clampy nature is totally appealing. Not to mention, I can get even more mileage out of my\u00a0Glossier lighter\u00a0\ud83d\ude07.
