    "text": "By Gillian Fuller In 2014, Asian beauty e-tailer Soko Glam launched its annual Best of K-Beauty Awards, honoring the year's top Korean beauty products. Now, three years later, following the crowning of this year's 10 winners, the K-beauty shop has decided to take the celebration one step further \u2014 with a shopping extravaganza, along with a deep discount to boot. For a limited time, Soko Glam is offering 15 percent off (!) to all winners \u2014 starting right now. The discount, which you can get using the code \"BOKB17\" at checkout at sokoglam.com, may not seem like much at first glance \u2014 but considering not one of the hundreds of available products exceed $70 regularly, we'd say it's pretty significant price-slashing. Unsure of what to score at the sale? This year, winners include products from nearly every category: skin care (Soko Glam x CosRx Triple C Lightning Serum), hair care (British M Organics Annatto Hair Oil), and makeup (Etude House's beloved Dear Darling gel lip tints). Unfortunately, the sale only lasts until the products sell out on sokoglam.com \u2014 so scroll on ahead to see which winners are worth your hard-earned cash, and get to ordering. You know we'll be doing the same. This top-rated hair oil smoothes flyaways and tames frizz without weighing down the hair, thanks to a blend of lightweight oils (including anatto, pumpkin seed, and argan). The lightweight formula also protects the hair from environmental and UV damage \u2014 two major contributors to dull strands. ($67 reg; $56.95 sale) With more than 20 percent vitamin C, this skin-brightening serum is a must-have in our get-glowy beauty routines (and we\u2019re not alone: It once had 10,000 person wait list). The inexpensive fluid \u2014 which, thanks to its high concentration of antioxidants, helps to promote brighter, clearer and more-even skin \u2014 usually retails for $27, but you can snag a bottle (or two) right now for just $22.95. If there's anything you should buy right now, it\u2019s this \u2014 because you can bet it\u2019s going to sell out fast. ($27 reg; $22.95 sale) By Aliza Kelly By Gabi Thorne By Gabi Thorne Made with moringa seed extract and iris extract, this rich cleansing cream pulls triple-duty, removing makeup, dissolving dirt and oil, and boosts collagen production. It\u2019s also a great pick for those with sensitive skin, as \u2014 with all of ENature\u2019s products \u2014 it\u2019s formulated without parabens or artificial fragrances (both of which can worsen irritation in sensitive complexions). ($23 reg; $19.55 sale) We're huge fans of makeup that actually stays put \u2014 and this super-affordable lip tint certainly fits the bill (one tester proclaimed it would \"basically last through the zombie apocalypse\"). There are eight shades available, all of which give the lips a pretty, popsicle-stained effect that, as mentioned above, seriously lasts. We'll probably be buying them all. ($5 reg; $4.25 sale) This sprayable serum (one of our all-time fave K-beauty buys) stars antioxidant Vitamin C to brighten the skin, plus centella asiatica extract to calm inflammation and redness. Plus, it's sprayable. Does it get any cooler than that? (No, it doesn't).
