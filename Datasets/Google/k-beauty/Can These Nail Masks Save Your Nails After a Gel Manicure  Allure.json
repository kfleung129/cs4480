    "text": "By Renee Jacques Gel manicures are a great way to keep go chip-free for a few weeks, but they're not always great for your nails\u2014especially if you habitually peel the gel off at home, rather than getting it removed properly in the salon. But new \"nail masks,\" such as the ones sold by Korean beauty site Soko Glam, contain goat's-milk extract that supposedly strengthens brittle nails, as well as fruit extracts to soften cuticles. A writer for the site tried out a product called Sally's Box Friendly Milk Nail Masks, and she claimed it saved her nails after they were damaged from gel polish.

We asked Randy Schueller, a cosmetic chemist from The Beauty Brains, to review the ingredient list in the nail masks and he said they appear to moisturize nails due to their \"relatively high\" glycerin content. \"Glycerin is known to be a good moisturizer because it can bind water molecules,\" says Schueller. \"When the nail is moisturized, it's more flexible, so it can stand up to more wear and tear.\" Would you give these nail masks a try?
