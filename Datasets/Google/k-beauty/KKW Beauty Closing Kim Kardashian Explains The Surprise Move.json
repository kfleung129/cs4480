A post shared by KKW BEAUTY (@kkwbeauty)  It seems 2021 is a new season for Kim Kardashian in many ways. First, she initiated divorce proceedings with her husband of seven years, Kanye West, back in February. Then she closed the book on the show that started it all, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, last month. Now it seems she\u2019s ready to bring that fresh energy to her business affairs, namely her successful beauty line KKW Beauty. Taking to Instagram earlier today, Kardashian announced that KKW Beauty is officially closing \u2013 for now, any way. The entrepreneur shared that the brand\u2019s website would be \u201cshutting down\u201d to make way for a new direction. \u201cTo our loyal customers, it all started with a contour kit and expanded to eyes, lips, body and many incredible collections over the past four years,\u201d she wrote. Kardashian revealed that the KKW Beauty website would cease operations from midnight August 1 \u201cso that we can come back to you under a completely new brand.\u201d  A post shared by KKW BEAUTY (@kkwbeauty)  KKW Beauty was first launched in 2017, well before the wave of celebrities launching direct to consumer beauty lines became a thing. The brand went on to do well with a number of memorable collaborations and campaigns and a retail launch into Ulta Beauty. Then in 2020, Kardashian sold a 20 percent stake in the brand to cosmetics giant Coty for a cool US$200 million, signalling that big things were on the horizon. Coty \u2013 which also acquired a majority stake in sister Kylie Jenner\u2018s Kylie Cosmetics in 2019 \u2013 seemed poised to take the KKW Beauty brand global, but now it seems a relaunch will arrive first. Kardashian indicated her excitement at creating \u201cnew formulas that are more modern, innovative and packaged in an elevated and sustainable new look.\u201d  A post shared by KKW BEAUTY (@kkwbeauty)  While Kylie Cosmetics is undergoing its own rebrand, it makes sense for KKW Beauty to follow suit. Kardashian alluded to the notion that the relaunch could see her many beauty businesses \u2013 she also owns\u00a0KKW Fragrance and recently filed a trademark against SKKN BY KIM\u2013 housed \u201cin all categories from one single website.\u201d It\u2019s also assumed that she\u2019ll drop the \u2018W\u2019 from the name, given her recent split from West. The KKW Beauty website is running significant sales in the lead up to the site closure, so if you\u2019re wanting to snag a piece of cosmetics history, now\u2019s your chance. In the meantime, Kardashian promised fans the brand\u2019s hiatus won\u2019t be permanent. \u201cThank you so much for being on this incredible journey with me, and I promise we won\u2019t be gone for too long.\u201d topics:\nmakeup, Kim Kardashian, Kanye West, KKW beauty Grace Publishing Pty Ltd. \u00a9 All rights reserved.
