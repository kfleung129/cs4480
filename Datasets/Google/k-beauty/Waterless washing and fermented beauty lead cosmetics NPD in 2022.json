    "text": "WGSN predicts usability and sustainability will drive key trends for the next 12 months Trends forecaster WGSN has unveiled its 2022 beauty trends, which centre around usability and sustainability, from water-saving hygiene to faster make-up routines. Among the six \u2018ones to watch\u2019, as highlighted by WGSN, is \u2018waterless washing\u2019, an evolution of waterless beauty encompassing showerless shampoo and no-water shaving products. \u2018Fermented beauty\u2019, meanwhile, taps into the desire for potent products and is driven by K-beauty and J-beauty trends. Fermentation releases enzymes that break down molecules so they can better penetrate the skin. The fermentation process also results in the formation of acids, such as lactic and acetic acids, which act as natural preservatives, prolonging shelf life. \u2018The two-minute make-up bag\u2019 features products offering smart beauty hacks to save on effort, money and commitment. The trend, said WGSN, aligns with the convenience of fast, low maintenance looks adopted during the pandemic. Another new beauty trend that emerged during lockdown is \u2018beauty snacking\u2019, a term for those micro beauty moments incorporated into consumers\u2019 lives to break up the monotony of lockdown or working from home, such as flash treatments and even skin care sweets. \u2018Wild bathing\u2019 takes its cues from the urge to reconnect with nature and people\u2019s embracing open water, outdoor swimming and therapies such as Japanese onsen. As this moves indoors, WGSN predicts that products based on seaweed and seawater, and bathing materials derived from nature will prove popular. Finally, moving inland, \u2018coastal-foraged ingredients\u2019 will incorporate skin care and personal care based on ingredients like kelp, sea fennel and algae, famed for soothing, detoxifying and hydrating benefits. Local, seasonal and wild-harvested will be keywords here. \u201cThe trends for 2022 are a translation of WGSN\u2019s global consumer expertise and product design knowledge, which spans teams working across the globe,\u201d said Clare Varga, WGSN\u2019s Head of Beauty. \u201cThe top beauty trends for 2022 reflect wider societal changes, as consumers continue to look to sustainably minded practises and products including waterless elements and longer shelf lives.\u201d Through digital, live and print products, Cosmetics Business informs and inspires business leaders and decision-makers around the world.
