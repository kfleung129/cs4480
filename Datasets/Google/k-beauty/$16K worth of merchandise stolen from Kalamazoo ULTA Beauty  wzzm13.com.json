The Kalamazoo County Sheriff Office is investigating multiple incidents of theft at ULTA Beauty. The incidents happened on July 11 and 13 at the West Main St. location in Oshtemo Township. Police say the crimes are committed by an organized crime group who have stolen up to $16,000 in merchandise, mainly perfume. Their tactic? Rush into the store and grab as much things as possible in less than a minute, then fleeing before an employee can stop them. While it has not been confirmed, police are led to believe the suspects are from Grand Rapids. Surveillance from the ULTA Beauty store has managed to get photos of them. The suspects have also been caught on video. If you or anyone you know have leads or believe the suspects look familiar, KCSO asks that you contact them or Silent Observer. Photos of the suspects are provided here: \u25baMake it easy to keep up to date with more stories like this.\u00a0Download the 13 ON YOUR SIDE app now. Have a news tip?
