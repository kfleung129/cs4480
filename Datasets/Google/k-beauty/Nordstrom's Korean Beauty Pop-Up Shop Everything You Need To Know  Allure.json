    "text": "By Gillian Fuller For those of us who live and breathe all things beauty, Korean beauty is a godsend: The foreign-born industry is packed full of innovative, fun products, often at super-low price points. Unfortunately, coming across these Asian beauty goodies isn\u2019t always easy, especially if you don\u2019t live within driving distance to a Sephora\u2014or want to pay an arm and a leg for foreign shipping charges. Luckily, access to K-beauty just got a lot easier, thanks to Nordstrom. The department store\u2014which made headlines earlier this week for dropping all Ivanka Trump products from its inventory\u2014just launched a K- beauty concept shop, bringing high-end Korean makeup, skincare, body products and more to the masses. Trust me: You\u2019re going to want to check this out. The pop-up shops, which are tricked out in kitschy Korean-inspired decor like fuzzy pink yoga balls and spinning light displays, launch at seven North American Nordstrom locations (in Seattle, Los Angeles, Dallas, Chicago,Vancouver, Toronto, and Bellevue, WA ) and online today, February 10. The shops feature more than 500 (!) beauty products, including cult faves from brands like Too Cool For School (we've obsessed with their Egg Mousse Body Oil) and Glow Recipe, to exclusive finds never before sold on this side of the Pacific. Best of all? Everything clocks in at under $100\u2014so you\u2019re safe to shop to your heart\u2019s (or wallet\u2019s) content. Unlike Nordstrom\u2019s new natural beauty section, which launched last month, the K-beauty concept shop is separate from Nordstrom\u2019s in-house beauty selection, and\u2014at least, for now\u2014temporary. Both the brick-and-mortar locations and the online shop will run through March 26th. However, according to Popsugar, if the pop-up proves successful, Nordstrom may consider permanently expanding its K-beauty offerings, making the world\u2014or at least, um North America\u2014a more diverse, prettier place for us beauty lovers.
