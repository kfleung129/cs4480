By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJeff Benjamin It has long been rumored that Will.i.am\u2019s anticipated \u201c#willpower\u201d album would feature K-pop act 2NE1 \u2014 a move that would bring the growing genre closer to the West. Many names were thrown out in the Black Eyed Pea\u2019s fourth solo effort \u2014 like British darling Cheryl Cole \u2014 but Blackjacks, the name of their dedicated fanbase held their breath until an official tracklisting came.

There are a few similarities between the leaked will.i.am/2NE1 collaboration \u201cTake The World On.\u201d Again, listeners hear a house-inspired piano banger on the chorus. As well, we hear 2NE1 showing off a more explicit side of their lyrical game. Leader CL raps on the first verse, \u201cThey get none of my kitty kitty. / On my sh-t \u2018cause it looks nice\u201d using several explicatives throughout the section. This is continues with the side will.i.am brought out on \u201cWorld\u201d when CL declares, \u201cYou and I / let\u2019s go multiply.\u201d Related\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBTS' V Drops Two Very Different Remixes of 'Slow Dancing' Solo Single\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t04/16/2013  But \u201cDumb\u201d is hardly a rehash of \u201cWorld\u201d as it breaks into a wacky, dubstep production on the verses as well uses far less Auto-Tune. Lead vocalist Bom and CL sound clear and powerful on their sections. Though, Blackjacks may be sad to hear members Minzy and Dara used sparingly. The inclusion of apl.de.ap is suspect too as 2NE1 is more than capable of holding their own as rappers and singers, but the extra appeal of a mini Black Eyed Peas reunion on \u201cDumb\u201d could bring in more listeners who may not know the group. \u201c#willpower\u201d will be released April 23. Recently, CL sat down with Billboard and predicted her group\u2019s K-pop comeback to place in April. With the month half over, it looks unlikely (schedules in K-pop change all the time), but if their surprise performance at PSY\u2019s Happening concert was any indication, 2NE1 is more than ready to hit the stage again.
