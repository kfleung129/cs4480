Yoga helps the little girl \"in her ballet and gymnastics,\u201d Khoriaty says. \u201cNow she\u2019s so good at it.\u201d   Singer-Songwriter Florence Khoriaty packs her yoga mat first when preparing for a trip. And the Montr\u00e9al artist has travelled regularly since she debuted her first CD at 21. Now 30, the prolific performer and single mother, known professionally as Florence K, has recently released her sixth studio album, I\u2019m Leaving You.  Khoriaty credits yoga for helping her voice, helping her stay strong helping her make an extra connection with her 7-year-old daughter, Alice Rose. She doesn\u2019t miss a day at her local yoga studio when she\u2019s home. \u201cIf I\u2019m not in town, I have my yoga mat and I practise wherever I can,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I discovered yoga it opened a new door to me.\u201d Two years ago, Khoriaty hit a low point after suffering a breakdown that made her stop everything. \u201cI saw it coming,\u201d she says. Years of hard work started taking a toll \u2014 she had recorded her second album while pregnant and hadn\u2019t stopped touring since. \u201cI was taking 20 planes a month,\u201d she says. Then she split from her daughter\u2019s father and the experience \u2014 coupled with the sudden shift to single motherhood \u2014 proved too much. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find myself anymore and I couldn\u2019t function,\u201d she says. \u201cI could go seven nights without sleep. I couldn\u2019t work, I couldn\u2019t focus \u2014 I had no concentration at all.\u201d And she had also stopped practising yoga earlier that year. Khoriaty\u2019s breakdown lasted three months. \u201cI was very well surrounded by my family, friends, my manager and my work team,\u201d she says. \u201cThey gave me the time and space that I needed to get back on my feet.\u201d She attended counselling with her daughter, to ensure Alice, then 5, understood what was happening. Once Khoriaty started eating and sleeping again, she returned to yoga, with an initial pledge to practise daily for one month. \u201cI do it every day now, no matter what,\u201d she says. Yoga has now become something mother and daughter do together. They sometimes do it spontaneously at the park or the beach. \u201cIt helps her a lot in her ballet and gymnastics,\u201d Khoriaty says. \u201cNow she\u2019s so good at it.\u201d Other lessons she learned from that bleak period include communication, organization, self-care and a positive outlook, she says. \u201cChildren listen and hear everything, so you want to live the best possible life,\u201d Khoriaty says. \u201cYou want to be an example for your children. I\u2019m her everything, so that means I have to take care of myself.\u201d Khoriaty still travels frequently, but everything negative has changed. She hired a nanny for when she\u2019s away. Wherever she is, she stays fully engaged with Alice. Sometimes they talk about when she was sick. \u201cI want her to accept herself with everything, the highs, the lows, the great moments, the tougher moments,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I want to give her the right tools to do that. \u201cI feel like my giving her the gift of yoga, I am giving her a tool for life,\u201d she says. Florence K performs at Toronto\u2019s Jazz Bistro, at 251 Victoria St., on Dec. 3.
