    "text": "Agenda-setting intelligence, analysis and advice for the global fashion community. Before Alicia Yoon launched Peach and Lily, the e-tailer known for bringing South Korean beauty to the American masses by curating products for the likes of CVS, Walmart and Ulta, she hosted a focus group to gauge what people knew about K-beauty. The year was 2012 and the result, she learned, was not much at all. \u201cIt was a big question mark,\u201d said Yoon, who saw an opportunity in the extremely limited K-beauty selection in New York\u2019s Chinatown and Koreatown, not to mention major department stores and beauty retailers. Enthusiasts seeking out hyaluronic acid ampoules and snail serums resorted to second-hand marketplaces like eBay, where quality and authenticity weren\u2019t guaranteed. Following a period of rapid growth at home and abroad in the 2010s, Korean brands like Sulwasoo, Laneige, Innisfree and Tonymoly can now be found on physical and digital shelves at Sephora, Bergdorf Goodman in the US, Selfridges and Boots in the UK, to name a few \u2014 the byproduct of a westward pivot of South Korea\u2019s export strategy to mitigate against an overreliance on the China market. The second half of the last decade saw South Korea become the world\u2019s fourth-largest exporter of beauty products, according to Bloomberg. European and American beauty conglomerates soon wanted in on the action, with L\u2019Or\u00e9al acquiring local brand Stylenanda\u2019s beauty arm 3CE in 2018, a year before Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies\u2019 $1.1 billion acquisition of Dr Jart owner Have & Be Co. Allure K-beauty edit Allure's K-beauty edit. Allure. (Courtesy) Estimated by Allied Market Research in 2019 to be worth $21.8 billion in five years time, K-beauty\u2019s future still looked relatively bright before the pandemic hit. The category\u2019s global rise hasn\u2019t been blemish-free though. \u201cThat golden boom period is fading away, but it\u2019s not completely over yet,\u201d said Maggie Kim, co-founder and former brand director of up-and-coming Korean indie brand Hince. Cracks started to appear in 2017 when Korean American journalist Euny Hong wrote in an op-ed for The New York Times, titled \u201cI Grew Up Around Korean Beauty Products. Americans, You\u2019ve Been Had,\u201d which contended that \u201cginseng and Jeju volcano water are not the whole story behind that flawless skin\u201d belonging to Korean women. Instead, she pointed to the country\u2019s status as a world plastic surgery capital. Once Covid-19 took its toll on the industry, it was revealed that Suh Kyung-bae, chief executive of K-beauty behemoth Amorepacific, which owns brands like Sulwhasoo, Etude House and Laneige, saw his fortune drop from $8 billion in 2017 to $3.6 billion in 2020. While it\u2019s true that K-beauty\u2019s top exports continue to inspire global brands\u2019 offerings \u2014 from sheet masks and foundation cushions, to double cleansing products \u2014 the maturation of the category, having penetrated markets like the US and Europe, means big and small players face fierce competition both at home and abroad. The struggle for differentiation has only intensified in the wake of the pandemic as businesses doubled down on ultra-experiential retail and content-centric direct-to-consumer channels to give them the edge. The Pandemic Effect K-beauty brands were well positioned to respond to customers\u2019 needs during the pandemic \u2014 Koreans wore face masks pre-Covid to combat dust pollution and are accustomed to addressing skin concerns like \u201cmaskne\u201d and damaged skin barriers, noted Peach and Lily\u2019s Yoon. Other curation businesses, like New York-based Soko Glam, have also found success and continued to see growth throughout the pandemic. \u201cWhen Covid-19 hit, there was a big emphasis on self-care and K-beauty\u2019s story fit in perfectly to that trend,\u201d said Liah Yoo, founder of Seoul-headquartered Krave Beauty. \u201cSuddenly, doing a 10-step skin care routine didn\u2019t seem superfluous but rather necessary to help you rebalance yourself and do something with all that extra time.\u201d Suddenly, doing a 10-step skin care routine didn\u2019t seem superfluous but rather necessary to help you rebalance yourself. The category\u2019s focus on skin care also insulated it from the decline in sales of colour cosmetics \u2014 a 55 percent year-on-year drop for prestige brands, according to a McKinsey report published in May. Even so, K-beauty hasn\u2019t been immune to the fallout. Yoon observed that some brand partners saw packaging suppliers pivot to PPE, leaving them in the lurch. Like fashion, beauty supply chains were hit by delays and cancellations. The situation has improved a year on, she added, but brands aren\u2019t out of the woods yet; the lack of tourists and a reliance on exports are still denting sales. Some trends that gained ground during the pandemic are here to stay. Yoon believes that current beauty concerns \u2014 like fighting environmental stressors and repairing the skin barrier \u2014 will be relevant in the long-term. Meanwhile, like their global peers, K-beauty players are intensifying their focus on sustainable, cruelty free products. Where brands had previously been put off by the heavy R&D investments and risks of betting on unfamiliar concepts, clean beauty has \u201cbecome the main leading trend,\u201d said Kim. K-Beauty\u2019s New Wave There has yet to be an independent beauty player capable of toppling hegemons like Amorepacific, Able C&C and LG. But Korea\u2019s younger upstarts are, as a whole, a force to be reckoned with. \u201cWhen you look at it from like the big conglomerates\u2019 perspective, collectively, the indie brands are taking market share,\u201d said Yoon. \u201cBut when you then look at it from an individual indie brands perspective, it\u2019s really hard.\u201d Part of the challenge is competing with conglomerates in a category renown for sophisticated, expensive R&D to produce \u201cunique textures, delivery systems, ingredients and packaging, all at competitive price points,\u201d says Charlotte Cho, co-founder of Soko Glam. Competition isn\u2019t limited to local players, where even global brands have been compelled to seek out manufacturing partners in Korea to get their hands on the same technology. Moreover, market dynamics have changed. Growth, which at a time swept across the category, is now concentrated among a select number of individual brands; more than 30,000 beauty businesses are licensed in Korea, according to Kim; and consumers are savvier and more demanding than ever. Up-and-coming brands can no longer follow their predecessors\u2019 playbooks. This is why Krave Beauty\u2019s Yoo doesn\u2019t market her brand, which has grown over 250 percent year-on-year since it launched in 2017, with a K-beauty label. \u201cI think it\u2019s a double-edged sword when a brand identifies strongly in a specific category,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier and faster to grow the brand reputation by riding trends, but it can hinder the growth of the brand in a long run.\u201d Post-pandemic, the 10-step routines K-beauty pioneered are due for an overhaul. \u201cWe need to figure out a way to excite people and tell our story without feeding into product overconsumption or neglecting our environmental footprint,\u201d said Yoo. It\u2019s no longer enough for new entrants to market themselves as K-beauty brands. \u201cA retailer might say, we\u2019re already carrying seven [of them,]\u201d said Yoon. \u201cWhat\u2019s your distinct point of view?\u201d Nonfiction A Nonfiction campaign. Nonfiction. Indeed, K-beauty businesses are realising that carving out a brand identity and building loyalty are worthier investments than churning out trending products. \u201cFads came and went around particular ingredients or conceptual items and all brands would jump on the bandwagon,\u201d said Cha Hae-young, founder of up-and-coming fragrance and body care brand Nonfiction. From sunscreen sticks to centella asiatica, players focused on releasing hit products at the same time, rather than developing their brand identity. This is changing. Smaller players like Nonfiction are proof that doing things differently pays off. \u201cOur goal is to make sure our customers say in confidence, \u2018I\u2019m a Nonfiction user,\u2019\u201d said Cha, who is already in talks to take the brand to other Asian markets. \u201cThat\u2019s our starting point.\u201d Rewiring Retail Touch Points As is the case across the globe, the pandemic boosted e-commerce growth in Korea\u2019s already sophisticated market to 22.3 percent annually in 2020, according to GlobalData. Behemoths Amorepacific and LG Household & Healthcare are among the major firms amping up investment in online channels to keep up with smaller, more agile upstarts. Amorepacific is \u201creaping significant results in online channels,\u201d Julien Bouzitat, chief marketing and digital officer at Amorepacific US, told BoF. Alongside a goal to hit 5.6 trillion won (just over $5 billion) in sales and 380 billion won ($343 million) in profit this year, the group aims to grow e-commerce sales by 30 percent. But it has some catching up to do. Jamie Ko, Seoul-based country and research manager at Euromonitor, attributed Amorepacific\u2019s shaky performance in 2020 to its being late to the digital game: the group saw revenues and operating profit drop 23 percent and 63 percent year-on-year, respectively. Alongside its moves online, Amorepacific is working towards profitability by reshuffling offline channels and supplying products to multi-brand stores. The group\u2019s priority has been \u2014 and continues to be \u2014 amping up brand awareness. Though it was founded in 1945 and is a household name in Korea, it has yet to build such a legacy abroad, said said Bouzitat. Giants cannot be dependent on their conventional, market-dominant distributors anymore. \u201c[Giants] cannot be dependent on their conventional, market-dominant distributors anymore,\u201d said Hince\u2019s Kim; rather, Korea\u2019s discerning beauty shoppers need to be swayed by creative and convincing digital marketing. Like Chinese firms, diligent Korean players are accustomed to tailoring their marketing content and strategy to individual formats and platforms in their local market like live-streaming, which is growing rapidly. \u201cEach sales channel now comes with like a very distinctive way that you need to market,\u201d said Yoon. This has implications outside of South Korea: the market, like others in Asia, is where new digital strategies are taking shape before trickling westward. If K-beauty innovators take their strategies abroad, brands in the US and Europe will follow their lead. For Nonfiction\u2019s Cha, sales in owned channels are consistently outpacing those at multi-brand retailers and concept stores. But she isn\u2019t any less discerning when it comes to wholesale. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about how much [a wholesale partner] can sell \u2014 it\u2019s more about how they have established their brand image and trust with consumers,\u201d said Cha, whose products are currently stocked at Korea\u2019s Sephora, 10 Corso Como, and The Conran Shop in addition to Nonfiction\u2019s direct-to-consumer channels. Physical Retail Innovation Outbreaks and closed borders have deserted Seoul\u2019s major shopping districts like Myeong-dong and Itaewon. But where K-beauty brands had already invested in making their native stores destinations in their own right before the pandemic hit, they are already better positioned to welcome shoppers back to stores once infection cases drop, said Yoon. Before the pandemic, South Korea\u2019s government aimed to draw 20 million overseas visitors to its shores in 2020, having welcomed 17.5 million in 2019. Seoul in particular has become a global beauty hot spot for tourists and industry insiders like Yoon, who like many in the industry would make the rounds in Gangnam and Myeong-dong to discover up-and-coming trends and technologies.

(ED JONES/AFP via Getty Images) Unlike in larger markets like the US, where beauty brands must establish themselves in crucial cities and districts to make an impact, K-beauty players can reach most of their local target audience through setting up shop in Seoul alone, Yoon added. This allows brands to experiment with and truly invest in their offline locations. Amorepacific-owned Aritaum\u2019s Gangnam flagship features a music lounge and photo booth to mimic a K-pop theme, with overhead lighting rigs and a product \u201cstage\u201d to match. Multi-brand retailer Oliveyoung\u2019s Myeong-dong flagship includes cubicles where visitors can try on scents without being overwhelmed by products in their vicinity. At Eco Your Skin\u2019s Chungdamdong spa, Skin Lab L, products are arranged by ingredients, customers undergo a skin consultation to figure out their \u201cskin age\u201d and are recommended personalised treatments, like oxygen blast facials, accordingly; records are kept to map out long-term progress and boost brand loyalty. Though experiential retail and \u201cretailtainment\u201d have been buzzwords for years, Yoon has yet to see brands in the US catch up. \u201cKorea is still much further along in delivering what experiential retail really looks like,\u201d she said, hoping that Korean brands will take their learnings from home to locations abroad.
