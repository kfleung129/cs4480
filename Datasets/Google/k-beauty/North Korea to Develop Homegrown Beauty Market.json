    "text": "Print No media source currently available  North Korea is asking its young, middle-class women to give up international cosmetics and use products made in their own country. The cosmetics campaign comes as international trade restrictions tighten, and products made in other countries become even more difficult to get. Pushing homegrown beauty has been a political goal since the days of the North\u2019s first leader Kim Il Sung. But the effort has become stronger under his foreign-educated grandson, Kim Jong Un. Recent defectors and North Korea experts say the campaign is having some success because of the popularity of South Korea\u2019s K-beauty movement. The K-beauty movement uses products with natural ingredients that are plentiful in both Koreas. But North Korea\u2019s attempt to create K-beauty products of their own has met with some quality issues. Manufacturers also have difficulty importing the few foreign ingredients that cosmetics require. Leader Kim Jong Un once dismissed North Korean beauty products, saying they make \u201craccoon eyes,\u201d reported the Japan-based Choson Sinbo newspaper in 2015. But Kim has since visited cosmetic factories several times with his wife to popularize the products. Earlier this year, North Korea\u2019s state-run television KRT showed a video about Pyongyang Cosmetics Factory. It showed a woman replacing Chanel products with North Korean products. \u201cLots of foreign customers living in the state visit our shop,\u201d Yang Su Jong told Reuters on a rare visit to the capital last year. She is a sales assistant at Pyongyang Cosmetics Factory. Chanel, in response to Reuters\u2019 questions, said it did not export products to North Korea. It suggested the products were illegal copies. First lady and a girl band North Korea has long controlled its peoples\u2019 appearance. Blue jeans and clothes with writing in English were banned under Kim\u2019s father, Kim Jong Il. The closed country was trying to keep Western influences out. But that has changed since Kim came to power in 2011. He and his wife, Ri Sol Ju, began making public appearances. Ri, a former musician, wore colorful clothing that appealed to a desire for self-expression, explained Nam Sung-wook. He is a professor of North Korean studies at Korea University. \u201cKim Jong Un\u2026gave rise to first lady Ri Sol Ju, who furthered the regime\u2019s interest in cosmetics,\u201d he said. Kang Na-ra is one North Korean defector who said she used to buy South Korean cosmetics at private markets that help form the North\u2019s informal market economy. \u201cI really wanted to copy (K-beauty) makeup\u2026when I was in the North,\u201d she said. Today North Korean women are asked to wear the kind of clothing and makeup used by either the first lady, or the all-woman \u2018Moranbong\u2019 musical group. Moranbong is North Korea\u2019s answer to South Korea\u2019s popular K-pop music. New markets and limits Pyongyang Cosmetic Factory shipped some Unhasu brand cosmetics to a new store in Moscow in May, Russia media reported. \u201cKorean Care\u201d is another Russian cosmetics shop selling South Korean products online. It started importing North Korean beauty products directly from Pyongyang last year. The company targets Russian women and has more than 10,000 customers. It says the products are popular because of their natural ingredients. \u201cIt was especially interesting because it\u2019s North Korean,\u201d said Margarita Kiselyova. She is a Russian customer who bought several products. \u201cI am satisfied with the quality,\u201d she added. A major South Korean cosmetics company called Amorepacific tested 64 North Korean products. It found some had small amounts of harmful ingredients. Amorepacific told Reuters it did not have additional details about the tests. I\u2019m Susan Shand.  The Reuters News Agency reported this story. Susan Shand adapted it for VOA Learning English.
