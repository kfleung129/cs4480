Healthy, soft, and natural skin was seen to be the most attractive because it exhibited modesty and caution, which are qualities that contribute to inner beauty. Women from middle-class families stayed true to themselves by applying light, natural, and spontaneous cosmetics rather than the thick makeup popular in other regions of Asia.
