    "text": "The Seoul-born brand's BB cream, treatment essence and snail cream will soon be available at Target stores. Beauty Editor, West Coast Target\u2019s Korean beauty news keeps on coming: The retailer is putting products from Missha on shelves. Twelve best-selling stockkeeping units from the BB cream powerhouse, which has been available on target.com since 2015, are launching in nearly 750 stores on Jan. 15. In select locations, they will be joining the 13-item lineup curated from various brands by Peach & Lily\u2019s Alicia Yoon to make a major statement about the\u00a0penetration of K-beauty in the American market. \u201cNot only has K-beauty been growing extensively, but our products have been going viral all over Asia. They\u2019ve already been established around the world, and that\u2019s why Target is bringing us in now,\u201d said Sena Lee, national account manager at Missha\u2019s U.S. arm. \u201cThis is a very big deal for us because we\u2019re reaching out to all consumers in the U.S. It will be so easy for them to see the brand, become aware of it and buy it.\u201d Related Articles\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tBeauty Features\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\tBobbi Brown on Three Years of Jones Road\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tRetail\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\tCoperni Brings Parisian Chic to Shanghai With Machine-A Pop-up Priced from $6 to $49, Missha\u2019s assortment within Target will include the BB cream M Perfect Cover in four shades with SPF 42; the primer M BB Boomer; treatment essence, treatment essence mist, treatment essence mask and night-repair ampoule offering from the brand\u2019s Time Revolution range; and snail cream, snail sleeping mask and snail hydro-gel mask from the Super Aqua Cell Renew collection. There are three times as many Missha products housed on Target\u2019s web site for consumers seeking\u00a0to dive deeper into the brand\u2019s merchandise. \u201cBrands normally have a skin-care line or are just focused on makeup. We have both, and we have quality ingredients and technology for both,\u201d Lee said. She pointed out M Perfect Cover exemplifies Missha\u2019s merging of the best of makeup and skin care. It contains skin-care ingredient stalwarts such as such as chamomile extract, rosemary extract, hyaluronic acid and ceramides to sooth, hydrate and rejuvenate skin while providing coverage to hide imperfections. The BB cream has been Missha\u2019s number-one product online at Target, but Lee underscored the Time Revolution items are hits as well. She highlighted that fermented yeast extract makes up 80 percent of the treatment essence\u2019s formula. \u201cThat\u2019s very condensed,\u201d Lee touted. She said the wrinkle-care and brightening ampoule product, which features bifida ferment to strengthen the skin\u2019s barrier and saccharomyces ferment filtrate for antioxidant properties, is also a strong seller. Missha\u2019s owner, the publicly traded Seoul-based Able C&C Co. Ltd., is the third-largest South Korean beauty company trailing the Amorepacific Group and LG Household & Health Care. During the first half of last year, Lee disclosed it generated roughly $210 million in revenues. In 2015, she said its revenue turnover totaled approximately $407 million. Missha is known for an enormous, affordable selection topping 1,300 sku\u2019s spanning skin care and makeup, and has sold more than 50 million BB creams since 2007. In addition, it makes K-beauty splashes by bringing out unusual ingredients like snail slime, a primary component of its Super Aqua Cell Renew products. The brand\u2019s history in the U.S. dates\u00a0back to 2005, when it opened a Manhattan store. Today, Missha has 11 stores in the country, notably two in New York.\u00a0Worldwide, Missha has some 2,300 branded stores spread across more than 40 countries. Outside of its own stores, Missha\u2019s American retail network exceeds 1,100 doors with the entrance into Target units. Bed Bath & Beyond, Harmon and Urban Outfitters are among the other retailers that carry Missha.
