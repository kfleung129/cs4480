Of particular interest will be a spotlight on the insatiable rise of country-led beauty trends. Think K-beauty is still the big one to watch? Think again\u2026 Gabriella Beckwith, senior analyst for beauty and fashion at Euromonitor International \u2013 set to present a snapshot tour of the world\u2019s top beauty hotspots said interest in country-branded beauty had snowballed in recent years, propelled a peaked interest in foreign travel and culture. Speaking to CosmeticsDesign-Europe ahead of the show, Beckwith said: \u201cIn the last few years, hotspot brands have become increasingly powerful as consumers cultivate stronger regional identifies, care more about authenticity, and supporting their own local economy and communities.\u200b \u201cHotspot brands allow consumers to place cultural attachment to their products, providing something more meaningful than just a simple beauty purchase.\u201d\u00a0\u200b Beckwith said out of all the country-led movements, Korean beauty had been the most talked in the last decade. \u201cK-beauty emerged as a beauty powerhouse following the so-called Korean Wave in the early 2000s, whereby South Korean popular culture such as K-drama and K-pop began to circulate internationally, and the country saw a rise in inbound tourists. The South Korean beauty industry has since prospered, both locally and internationally, and today is best known for its 10-step skin care routines, unique product innovations, and eccentric packaging.\u201d\u200b However, she said K-beauty had \u201cmatured in recent years\u201d, \u200bwith market growth of beauty and personal care products in South Korea up just 0.9% in 2018, compared to 6.5% in 2016. K-beauty giants like AmorePacific and LG Household & Health Care had also reported weaker performances recently, she said. \u201cIt appears consumers may be turning to new hotspots such as Japanese, Chinese, Australian and Scandinavian beauty.\u201d\u200b Asked which of these were the \u2018ones to watch\u2019 in 2020, Beckwith said: \u201cJapan and China are the two biggest hotspots to watch.\u201d\u200b Japan, she said, had a \u201crich heritage as a leader in beauty manufacturing\u201d \u200band was also a \u201cbreeding ground for science and technology\u201d.\u200b Beauty products from Japan, therefore, tended to be associated with \u201cefficacy, high-quality and benefit-led features\u201d, \u200bshe said. \u201cFor this very reason, Japanese beauty (J-Beauty) is experiencing somewhat of a resurgence, as consumers globally prioritise quality over quantity, particularly within skin care. Rather than a heavy focus on local ingredients, the essence of J-Beauty is about science, whereby success is driven by intense R&D, innovation and formula breakthroughs.\u201d\u200b For China, Beckwith said interest surrounded its \u201chistorical roots\u201d\u200b and the fact the country was home to \u201cancient beauty rituals and skin treatments\u201d\u200b, including jade-rollers and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). \u201cChinese brands are now reviving and cashing in on local beauty traditions such as TCM, which appeals to Chinese consumers of all ages, being widely familiar with the ingredients. Chinese TCM brands such as Pechoin, Herborist and Inoherb are striving to rebuild consumer confidence in local brands.\u200b \u201cC-beauty is also benefitting from the rise in micro-influencers exhibiting pride in Chinese-made brands and promoting this to young Chinese consumers through digital platforms such as WeChat, Weibo and Little Red Book,\u201d \u200bshe said. German and Brazilian beauty brands were also worth watching closely in the near future, Beckwith said. Many brands in Germany, for example, were being founded by doctors, dermatologists or scientists and had a \u201cstrong association with engineering, functionality, and targeting specific skin conditions, with product claims that tend to be scientifically backed,\u201d\u200b she said. And in Brazil, there was a clear rise in beauty brands capitalising on the \u201cabundance of exotic ingredients\u201d\u200b found in the country\u2019s native eco-system, she said. Beckwith said understandably there was debate as to whether country-branded beauty trends would quickly rise and fall like a fad in the \u201cever-changing beauty industry\u201d, \u200bthese hotspots tended to bring much more than a bit of marketing to the global beauty world. \u201cTake Japanese beauty, for example, which is built almost entirely around creating efficacious and science-backed formulations. Efficacy remains one of the biggest priorities for consumers, and brands globally continue to take inspiration from Japan\u2019s forward thinking and tech-led beauty market,\u201d\u200b she said. Similarly, K-beauty had succeeded for so long because beyond the \u201cfun and kitsch packaging\u201d, \u200bthe trend brought great innovation and new product ideas, she said. \u201cSheet masks, for instance, have become a staple in the beauty regimes of many consumers globally, as well as a core part of the portfolio of major beauty players.\u201d\u200b So, whilst interest in particular countries may shift, the fascination with global beauty hotspots will continue to be an important trend to watch this year.
