Now, the Korean megastar has teamed up with MAC Cosmetics to release a K-Beauty-inspired makeup collection, and the range is positively spellbinding. Drawing on the aesthetic of tarot cards and astrology, the MAC Cosmetics x Pony Divine makeup collection features products designed to help you nail those big K-Beauty trends, like the perfect ombr\u00e9 lip and radiant, lit-from-within skin. \u201cMy collection with MAC is super meaningful to me in that I am able to bring K-Beauty, Korean culture, and Asian beauty and culture to the global market,\u201d said Pony in a press release released by MAC Cosmetics. And the products look absolutely dreamy in their celestial-themed packaging. Included in the line is a ground-breaking new product: the Matte Lip Mousse. It has a weightless formula and a misty soft-matte finish to help you perfect the sought-after, gradient lip trend that\u2019s huge in K-Beauty right now. Also featured in the collection are whimsical new shades of MAC Cosmetics\u2019 Extra Dimension Skinfinish and a shimmery version of the cult-favourite Prep + Prime Fix+ makeup setting spray to help you achieve the elusive \u2018glass skin\u2019 look. The range is set to drop on 2 October at Mecca Maxima and then 7 October at MAC Cosmetics stores and maccosmetics.com.au.
