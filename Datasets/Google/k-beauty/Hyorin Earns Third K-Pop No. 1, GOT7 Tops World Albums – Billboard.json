    "text": "Chart highlights from the K-Pop Hot 100 and beyond featuring SISTAR, Hyorin, GOT7, 4Minute, Rain, FTIsland, B1A4, Girl's Day, Brave Brothers and more. By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJeff Benjamin Another week, another SISTAR member topping the K-Pop chart. The girl group\u2019s leader earns her third solo No. 1 with \u201cGoodbye,\u201d a single off the soundtrack to popular Korean drama \u201cMy Love From the Star.\u201d The ballad showcases Hyorin\u2019s signature airy vocals as well as her belting powers toward the end.  Remarkably, \u201cGoodbye\u201d becomes Hyorin\u2019s third solo No. 1. While only six other acts can boast having three or more K-Pop No. 1s, the feat becomes even more impressive when one remembers the 23-year-old already has four chart toppers with her girl group SISTAR. (No. 1s are only officially considered for each act) Related\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBTS' V Drops Two Very Different Remixes of 'Slow Dancing' Solo Single\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t01/31/2014 Busker Busker, IU, K.Will and SISTAR all have four K-Pop Hot 100 No. 1s as Hyorin joins Lee Hi and Davichi in the three club. Further proving the popularity of \u201cYou Who Came From the Stars\u201d is another song from the soundtrack, Lyn\u2019s \u201cMy Destiny,\u201d at its former peak of No. 2. Lyn\u2019s ballad has fluctuated inside the top of the K-Pop rankings for five weeks now. \u201cGoodbye\u201d at No. 1 means that Lyn\u2019s attempts to earn her second No. 1 have again been blocked, but with four weeks at No. 1 in 2012, her ballad \u201cTo Turn Back the Hands of Time\u201d is still one of the longest-running K-Pop hits to date. Watch the official music video for \u201cMy Destiny,\u201d featuring scenes from \u201cMy Love From the Star\u201d and see if you get addicted too.  Further down the chart we see K-pop icon Rain and one of two of his new singles, \u201cLa Song,\u201d at No. 6. Since the K-Pop Hot 100\u2019s mid-2011 creation, Rain had not released music until breaking his hiatus in January 2014 with his \u201cRain Effect\u201d album. With its new peak, \u201cLa Song\u201d becomes his highest-charting entry yet. It was just two weeks ago that the song had jumped to No. 9, following with a drop down to No. 13 last week and now sits comfortably at No. 6 in its fourth week. The song\u2019s surge in popularity likely comes after Rain performed with a South Korean music legend Tae Jin-A, a veteran trot singer. The duo has combined its powers on recent performances of \u201cLa Song,\u201d helping it rocket back up the chart. Watch a performance below from K-pop music chart program \u201cMusic Core\u201d that already boasts more than half a million views on YouTube.  After earning one of the K-Pop Hot 100\u2019s biggest singles of 2013 with \u201cWhat\u2019s Your Name?,\u201d girl group 4Minute and super-producer Brave Brothers continue making chart magic with their latest collaboration, \u201cGetting Fatter,\u201d at No. 10. The catchy new single is the latest track released celebrating Brave Brothers\u2019 10th anniversary in the industry. More surprise artists will be revealed as the year rolls on.  On Billboard\u2019s World Albums chart, rookie boy band GOT7 has snagged the No. 1 slot with debut EP \u201cGot It?\u201d GOT7 is certainly not the first K-pop act to top the chart \u2014 fellow boy bands SHINee, B.A.P, EXO and Super Junior-M all did in 2013 \u2014 but the group does benefit from timing: It\u2019s the fastest act to hit No. 1 on World Albums chart after its debut. A mere 16 days after debut single \u201cGirls Girls Girls\u201d was released, \u201cGot It?\u201d was revealed as No. 1 on the World Albums chart. K-Town recently named GOT7 one of the five K-pop acts to watch in 2014.\u00a0Watch its debut music video for \u201cGirls Girls Girls,\u201d which rises to No. 36 on the K-Pop Hot 100, from No. 52, in its second week.
