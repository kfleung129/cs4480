She\u2019s survived an entire decade in the industry but Rosie Huntington-Whiteley\u00a0recalls how difficult it was starting out as a model at the age of 15. The Victoria\u2019s Secret Angel has opened up about her early years in the biz in an interview with\u00a0The Guardian\u00a0and says she was instructed by her agent to stick to a ridiculously strict diet. One agent even advised her to eat just \u201ca single piece of sushi a day\u201d, the British beauty revealed. Thankfully, her response to the agent was \u201cGo f*** yourself!\u201d. The 26-year-old, who is the face of Australian makeup label ModelCo, says the industry has changed drastically during her 10-year career because models now have to be \u201cmore real now than ever\u201d. \u201cEverybody wants to know the models,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s more engagement \u2026 You\u2019re no longer this one-dimensional image. It\u2019s more expected now for supermodels to be smart, to have opinions, to have a personality.\u201d Last week, British former teen model Georgina Wilkin opened up about her eight-year battle with anorexia and blamed the industry for pushing her to that point. \u201cIf you weren\u2019t thin enough you were sent out of the room immediately,\u201d she told the\u00a0Telegraph.\u00a0\u201cI was sent out. At the end of the day, my modeling career lasted for three years and as a result, I\u2019ve had anorexia for eight, and I\u2019m still battling it today. \u201cFor the sake of a couple of years of modeling success, it\u2019s just not worth it.\u201d This article originally appeared on News.com.au.
