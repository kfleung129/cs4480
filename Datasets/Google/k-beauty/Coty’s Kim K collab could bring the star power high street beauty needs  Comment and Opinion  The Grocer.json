    "text": "Source: Twitter (@kkwbeauty) By Daniel Selwood2020-06-30T14:08:00+01:00 Many things about Kim Kardashian West are big. Foremost is her star power. Remember how she \u2018broke the internet\u2019 by stripping off in 2014 for Paper magazine? The breadth of her career is also huge: socialite, reality TV star, actor, author, entrepreneur and musician. Just as massive are her Instagram following (177 million at time of writing) and her husband\u2019s ego. Of course, it\u2019d be remiss not to mention curvy Kim\u2019s most prominently large feature, which, of course, is\u2026 her personal wealth. It\u2019s now an estimated $900m (\u00a3734m) following her business deal this week with US cosmetics giant Coty. The company has bought a 20% stake in Kardashian West\u2019s KKW Beauty company for $200m (\u00a3163m). It\u2019s a deal that could prove a boon for both parties. Kim can now afford all the gaudy leather outfits she and Kanye need. Coty, meanwhile, has the opportunity to benefit from her gigantic influence \u2013 and it\u2019s much needed. As data and analytics provider GlobalData says, the company \u201cis depending on the strong personality and social media-driven KKW after its other brands are struggling\u201d. That\u2019s certainly the case in the UK. Like many of its big-name rivals, Coty is suffering on the high street. The cosmetics category lost an unsightly \u00a351.5m in value last year as price-savvy shoppers turned to online and/or cheaper make-up, such as Superdrug\u2019s Revolution offer [Nielsen 52 w/e 7 September 2019]. Coty\u2019s biggest UK make-up brands, Rimmel and Max Factor, dived by 6.1% and 11.9% respectively. Could the aforementioned star power of contouring superfan Kardashian West turn things around? Celeb-backed make-up brands can prove hugely lucrative, as Fenty Beauty has proven. The brand created by pop megastar Rihanna \u2013 in partnership with Louis Vuitton owner LVMH \u2013 is valued at $3bn after less than three years on the market (having been Harvey Nichols\u2019 biggest-ever beauty launch). So, the combo of Kardashian West\u2019s rep and Coty\u2019s reach could prove a lucrative proposition for the cosmetics market. The two parties intend to focus on entering new beauty categories and global expansion beyond her existing product lines. Though probably not immediately. The so-called new normal doesn\u2019t seem to include a strong desire for cosmetics. At least not in the UK, where hopes that Covid-19 would have a lipstick effect on the category have been well and truly dashed. Shoppers have shied away from buying mascara, concealer and the like \u2013 causing overall value to plunge \u00a348.1m between March and April [Kantar]. However, the future of beauty looks brighter. \u201cThe sector is expected to bounce back in 2021, and reach a forecasted full recovery by 2023,\u201d GlobalData notes. And with Kim Kardashian West by its side, Coty could soon be enjoying some serious booty.    Sign in to comment on this article Not logged in before? Register for FREE guest access today.
