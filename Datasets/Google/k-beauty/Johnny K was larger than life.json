His widow, Laura Prentice, recalls Toronto restaurateur John Katsuras, who died Sept. 28 at age 60. This article is over a year old, and the information within may be out of date. John Katsuras with daughter Kevi and wife Laura Prentice. When he wasn\u2019t smiling, John Katsuras was laughing. It was strange, really. If you visited one of the restaurants he ran with wife and chef Laura Prentice over the past 30 years, his grin was a fixture, as steadfast as her exquisite cooking, the flawless service and the moody atmosphere.  I can still see Johnny K, as friends called him, beaming in a white jacket at the entrance to Gus, a sprawling bistro that would morph into a nightclub as the skies darkened over Bay St. I can still see him perched at the bar, sipping a beer from the bottle at The Playpen, the last joint he opened in 2011. \u201cHe was never afraid to try anything,\u201d says Laura as we meet for lunch at Globe Bistro, a few days after the funeral. \u201cThe only thing he was afraid of was leaving me and my daughter.\u201d Her voice trails off. We blink back tears. They met in 1977. Disco had infiltrated the city and Johnny, then 23, had just returned from a trip to the French Riviera. He wanted to animate Toronto with the same nocturnal glitz of Saint Tropez. He wanted his city to be fabulous. One night, inside a midtown club called Hippopotamus, their eyes met and Johnny\u2019s smile was practically a high beam, outshining the strobe lights. As if in a trance, Laura stepped toward it. She would never step back. They swayed to Donna Summer\u2019s \u201cLast Dance.\u201d They became best friends and, soon, a romance bloomed. For the next 37 years, they were inseparable, one of this city\u2019s great love stories. From the start, Johnny followed his own instincts, even when they ran counter to prevailing wisdom. When he opened Pan on the Danforth in 1994, he wanted to nudge the area\u2019s Greek cuisine in a new direction. So he banned souvlaki from the menu, a decision that baffled some and intrigued others, including Mick Jagger, who quietly returned more than once for the sea bass. The following year, they opened Lolita\u2019s Lust across the street. \u201cLolita\u201d was Laura\u2019s nickname. So she objected to this venue moniker on the reasonable grounds that it was embarrassing. Johnny laughed. He said it was the perfect name. Besides, he added, there wouldn\u2019t be a sign out front. Instead, he just painted the entire building green. This was the pioneering vision that powered so many of their places, a list that included Queen Street Eatery, Tazmanian Ballroom, Krush, Tomi-Kro, Johnny K and The Liberty, which opened in 1989 as Johnny was recovering from a serious car accident, one that no doubt conjured a haunting childhood memory. It was Christmas Eve, 1970. Johnny was 15, at home with his mother Voula and two younger brothers. There was a knock on the door. When Johnny answered, a policeman relayed unthinkable news. His father had been killed in a car accident. Johnny never talked about this heartbreak. But losing his father as a boy clearly left a sense of transience in the man. Johnny was obsessed with reinvention. He was terrified of getting stale. His feet, sometimes clad in gold Hugo Boss runway shoes that only he could pull off, were always moving. But even as he marched ahead, into the unknown, he was mindful of the past. His restaurants were filled with vintage artifacts from thrift shops. The Art Deco light fixtures inside The Playpen came from the Imperial Oil building on St. Clair. \u201cA place needs to have soul,\u201d he would say. \u201cOtherwise, what\u2019s the point?\u201d As new restaurants opened with seven-figure renovations, Johnny hunted for this elusive soul. As the industry became more corporate, with faceless investors and backers, the couple financed their own ventures. This could be stressful. But in those moments, Johnny never lost his focus or his passion for the theatrics of running a restaurant: the energy, the excitement, the interesting people. \u201cBefore we opened the doors each night,\u201d recalls Laura. \u201cHe would smile and say, \u2018It\u2019s show time.\u2019\u201d When he wasn\u2019t at work, Johnny listened to music. His tastes were eclectic, including Roy Orbison, Kid Rock, Lou Reed, Grace Jones, Bruno Mars and P. Diddy. He devoured certain movies multiple times, including The Godfather, Saturday Night Fever and The Bourne Supremacy series. One of his great joys was watching goofy films, like Dumb and Dumber, with beloved daughter Kevi. He could play backgammon for hours on a beach. He loved the ocean, especially sailing the Caribbean with friends and Laura by his side. Until cancer claimed his life on Sept. 28, at the age of 60, few in the city lived with the same intensity. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s really hit us yet,\u201d says Laura, who went through her own struggle with cancer in 2002. \u201cHe was larger than life. He touched so many people. Where I go without him, I don\u2019t know. I have no idea.\u201d Before a celebration of his life last week, Laura wrote Johnny a final letter. It ended with the following: \u201cI will miss you so much. Nothing will taste the same without you. I\u2019ll see you on a beautiful beach one day with a Miller High Life and we\u2019ll dance.\u201d vmenon@thestar.ca Vinay Menon\nis the Star\u2019s pop culture columnist based in Toronto.
