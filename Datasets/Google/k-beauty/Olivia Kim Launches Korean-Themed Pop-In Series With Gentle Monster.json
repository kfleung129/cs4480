Conceptual eyewear line Gentle Monster launches the series on January 6, followed in February by a shop featuring the obsessively fun world of K-Beauty. March brings forward-thinking Korean fashion brands curated by Olivia Kim, Vice President of Creative Projects at Nordstrom. Gentle Monster, the youthful and cult favorite Korean eyewear company will offer a selection of 40 styles of men's and women's frames reflecting the brand's unique design sensibility with angular and rounded styles fit for high fashion magazines and casual everyday wear. Included in the selection will be six styles exclusively available at Pop-In@Nordstrom. \"Gentle Monster is excited to be a part of Pop-In@Nordstrom,\" said Taye Yun, VP Gentle Monster USA. \"This amazing opportunity allows us to reach out to Nordstrom customers through space and design. Although we have been present in select Nordstrom stores, Pop-In provides us with the platform to creatively connect directly with customers and introduce our brand in a new and exciting way.\" Each Pop-In location was created with a unique look and design, yet with a common thread mixing a variety of fabrics and textures as the structure, like a thick knitted wall or chiffon drapes to suggest an atmosphere of tranquility. Fabric walls are accented with mirrors and objects to create a unique experience for the visitor, following the brand's ethos of using space and design as tools to lead visual conversations with its loyal fan-base. For the launch, Pop-In partnered with the Gentle Monster team to produce unique virtual reality and 360 video content that allows customers to explore the experience in Gentle Monster flagship stores in Shanghai, Nonhyeon-dong and Bukchon stores in Seoul, South Korea, as well as the Downtown Seattle Nordstrom Pop-In shop. Pop-In@Nordstrom x Gentle Monster will be found at Nordstrom.com/POP and in the following Nordstrom locations: Link to Dropbox with all product and editorial imagery - https://www.dropbox.com/sh/rt9k8qunnh6hycp/AAACP3lVLK3bTGscEgxs9CDda?dl=0.
