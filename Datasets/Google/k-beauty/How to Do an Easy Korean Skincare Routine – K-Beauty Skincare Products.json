I am by no means lazy when it comes to my beauty routine (like, I even floss every day), but I never could wrap my head around doing a full 10-step skincare regimen every morning and night. Sorry, but a sheet mask twice a day was just never gonna happen for me. But when I spoke to Charlotte Cho, cofounder of the insanely popular K-Beauty site Soko Glam\u2014and owner of the dewy skin of my dreams\u2014I realized that I\u2019ve had it wrong this whole time. \u201cIt\u2019s not about having a certain number of steps in your routine at all,\u201d says Cho. \u201cIt\u2019s about being educated about what you could include in your routine to get great skin and having the right products that do the right things in the right order.\u201d (What\u2019s that thing about knowledge is power...? Oh, right.) \u201cWe\u2019ve been saying it from the beginning that you don\u2019t have to take K-Beauty literally and do all 10 steps, because it\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all model,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s here to show you the options and categories you might not have known were available, so you can choose what\u2019s best for you and your skin type.\u201d Basically, skincare is your own journey and it\u2019s not meant to be a manual, so instead of introducing the below 10 steps as a strict guide, I\u2019ll present them as a skincare ~menu~ of sorts. Familiarize yourself with all the categories, then pick and choose what makes sense for your skin goals. With a custom routine like this, nice skin is basically a guarantee. Step one is actually the first part of a two-step process called double-cleansing, and it starts with a cleansing oil (a makeup-removing formula that gently breaks down and dissolves makeup, grime, and oil, then washes them away cleanly). Whether your cleansing oil comes in the form of an oil with a pump or a balm that melts into the skin, the application is the same: Massage a quarter-size dollop into dry skin (yes, it needs to be dry) for 20 seconds, then rinse it off. Don\u2019t worry\u2014cleansing oils are water-soluble, meaning they won\u2019t leave behind an oily, pore-clogging residue. Cho says the most skin-changing discovery she\u2019s made from the K-Beauty life has been the double-cleanse, and for good reason: It gets your face really, really clean without stripping it or irritating it since you\u2019re using only gentle formulas. So after rinsing away your oil, cleanse a second time with your favorite water-based face wash, which could come in the form of a cream (for dry skin), foam (for oily skin), or gel (for combination skin). When it comes to exfoliators, you have two options: physical and chemical. A physical exfoliator is gritty, rough, or nubby (think scrubs, washcloths, and facial brushes) that works to physically slough away dead skin cells for a smoother surface. The only (major) downside? Physical exfoliators are often way too harsh for most people, especially those with sensitive skin, since they can create micro-tears in your skin\u2019s surface. Fun! Instead, Charlotte recommends using a microfiber cloth or a gentle mask with natural sugars if you insist on exfoliating physically. Or, you know, you could just use a chemical exfoliator. They sound intense, but chemical formulas rely on skin-loving acids to gently dissolve dead skin cells, smooth bumps, clear pores, and fade discoloration. The benefits are major and usually way less irritating that a physical scrub. To be extra safe, stick with BHA acids (beta hydroxy acids, like salicylic acid) for oily, acne-prone skin and AHA acids (alpha hydroxy acid, like lactic or glycolic acid) for sensitive or dry skin, and use one of these formulas just once a day, ideally at night. Washing your face, while important for removing dirt, makeup, and oil, can often leave your skin stripped of its natural oils. To bring your skin back into balance, Charlotte recommends following your cleanse with a hydrating toner. \u201cMany toners tend to be alcohol-based and drying, but in Korea, toners are about hydrating,\u201d she says. \u201cThe whole philosophy of the Korean skincare routine is about adding more hydration and nourishment to the skin versus stripping and drying it out.\u201d Toners are typically very watery and absorb easily into your skin, so they should be applied to clean, dry skin as one of the first steps in your routine. You can either use a cotton pad to swipe it across your skin or pour some into the palms of  your hands and press them into your skin. Now that your skin is cleansed and prepped, you can move forward with all the fun treatment options. What you decide to use in these next four steps is totally up to you (this is where the customization really comes into play), but Charlotte adds that for a Korean skincare routine, essence is an absolute staple. Korean essences are typically watery, like toners, and can be applied with the palms of your hands or in a spray mist form. \u201cBUT WAIT!\u201d you cry. \u201cAren\u2019t toners and essences the same thing?!\u201d Yes and no. They\u2019re very similar in a lot of ways (consistency and packaging), but basically what you don\u2019t get from a toner, you would then supplement with an essence. \u201cToner is going to bring hydration back to your skin,\u201d says Cho, \u201cbut essences usually contain some concentrated active ingredient that goes above and beyond what toner can provide,\u201d like brighteners, softeners, and plumpers. Apply them over your toner, in lieu of your toner, or skip them altogether! Remember: This is a menu, not a recipe. Ah, sheet masks. Another K-Beauty favorite. If it\u2019s the weekend and you\u2019ve got an afternoon to kill, treat yourself to a mask, but don\u2019t stress over it otherwise. Sheet masks come in many different formats and styles, but the main goal here, again, is hydration. \u201cMost of your skincare will evaporate as it dries, so the idea of K-Beauty is that the more you hydrate and layer, the more you lock in those ingredients and the more positive effects you\u2019ll see,\u201d Charlotte says. You\u2019re probably familiar with the concept of a serum, but an ampoule? Maybe not so much. So fast facts: A serum has concentrated active ingredients that address a specific concern, like dullness, dark spots, fine lines, etc., and an ampoule (sometimes referred to as a booster) is similar but has a higher concentration and is usually only used when you really need it\u2014like after a night out or a bad night\u2019s sleep. Serums/ampoules are a bit thicker than essences but thinner than moisturizer, so make sure to apply them early in your routine, before any creams, lotions, or oils. An eye cream might be too thick to layer under makeup during the day, but at night, it\u2019s an insanely good source of hydration for your itty-bitty fine lines. Apply it all around your eyes (including over your lids and under your eyes), making sure to use your weakest finger\u2014your ring finger, to be exact\u2014to gently pat it into your skin.    Listen, moisturizer is one of the nonnegotiable steps in any skincare routine, because your face needs this final layer of hydration to function properly\u2014kind of like how your body needs water to survive. Not only does it act as a barrier to lock in all the hydrating products you\u2019ve been adding up to this point, but it also helps restore your skin\u2019s health. The moisturizer you choose depends on your skin type, so if you have dry skin, try a richer cream formula, and if you have oily or acne-prone skin, go for a gel formula. Or if you\u2019re a little bit of everything, try an emulsion\u2014a K-Beauty cross between a gel and a cream. Emulsions are silky and lightweight but creamy enough to deeply hydrate skin. Apply them morning and night, especially during colder months. And here\u2019s the other nonnegotiable step of your skincare routine, because skin cancer is scary, and dark spots, hyperpigmentation, and premature aging aren\u2019t that fun either. But even if you hate the feeling of sunscreen or you\u2019re afraid it\u2019ll break you out, that\u2019s not an excuse, because there are so many different options that are guaranteed to work with your skin type. And in K-Beauty, it doesn\u2019t matter which sunscreen you choose, as long as you\u2019re wearing it every day. Because if you\u2019re not protecting your face from sun damage, you\u2019re pretty much undoing all of the skincare steps you just took. Sheet masks are expensive. Serums are expensive. Wear sunscreen, and don\u2019t waste them. Now that you\u2019ve reached the end, you may go forth and pick and choose which steps are best for you\u2014whether that\u2019s all 10 or just a few.
