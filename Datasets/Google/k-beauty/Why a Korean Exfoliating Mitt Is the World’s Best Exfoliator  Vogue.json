Before there was BB cream or cushion compacts, before the 10-step skin-care routine swept the country, Koreans were mad about exfoliation. So while others may turn to fine terry-cloth wands and high-tech sonic cleansing devices to shed their winter skin, my mind has called up the Korean washcloth, a simple exfoliating mitt that does the trick at 80 cents a pop. Made from pure viscose, with four telltale black stripes running along the seams, the ultra-abrasive cloths are a staple at Korean spas, or jjimjilbang. There, you can pay for some 20 minutes of torture, as a bath attendant sloughs the dead skin off your body, removing ddae\u2014the Korean word for dirt or grime\u2014and exposing the raw pink layer beneath. Or you can shell out $5 to buy a pack for your home and render your skin baby soft anytime. Ask any young Korean (including this one), and you\u2019ll no doubt hear how much she once hated those towels. To this day, there is a particular shade of electric green that gives me chills, conjuring memories of sitting in the tub while my mother sandpapered the skin off my arms. \u201cSee how clean it is?\u201d she would say, pointing at the pilling dirt and dead cells, only adding to my horror. Yet we do come to adore them. It\u2019s an intense treatment that takes time to grow into\u2014one that\u2019s gained a cult following at Korean spas\u2014and is increasingly available stateside, turning up in the form of Dermasuri\u2019s mitt or in bulk on Amazon. It took two decades, but I\u2019ve finally come to appreciate the brutal simplicity of the Korean washcloth\u2014especially when repairing my legs after a long, dry winter. A few tips to consider: Scrub only after a long soak, which softens the skin, then wet the mitt and apply a soothing soap. Green mitts are the standard, while other cloth colors come in varying degrees of strength, pink being the softest and blue being the most abrasive. Exfoliate your body just once a week, at most, and avoid the face. Above all, please spare the children. Eventually, they\u2019ll come around.
