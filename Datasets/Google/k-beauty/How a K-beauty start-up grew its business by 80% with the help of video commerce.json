It took more than seven or eight years since we started the brand,\u201d\u200b said Jeff Yoon, the brand\u2019s senior marketing director. Yoon said the firm was very aware that they had to focus on building up brand awareness from the start. \u201cThe conventional way of doing business is to go through a franchise or a wholesaler, but we has a different approach of going online first. But we did not focus on just selling products. We wanted to build the brand name in Korea.\u201d\u200b He added that the company built up its name by using social media marketing to target younger consumers. \u201cWe noticed that the younger generation of consumers were beginning to pay more attention to their looks and we used social media marketing methods to reach out to them.\u201d\u200b Yoon expressed that the advantage of social media marketing was its ability to transcend the limitations of time. \u201cThere\u2019s no day and night on social media, so we were able to work all day and all night as well.\u201d\u200b The hard work of building up brand awareness paid off for the company. \u201cAfter we became well-known online, we entered franchises like Olive Young and Watsons\u2026 and they came to us,\u201d \u200bsaid Yoon. However, Yoon said Grafen exploded when the company began filming short videos about its products for its social network channels. \u201cWe started the video commerce method just two years ago and it was a real turning point for us.\u201d\u200b Yoon elaborated that the company recognised there were limitations to showcasing its products in more conventional ways. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t expect consumers to come to our website to read about our products anymore. It\u2019s not enough, not today. People don\u2019t pay much attention and they don\u2019t want to waste their time reading articles on all our products.\u201d\u200b To capture consumers\u2019 short attention spans, the firm decided to tell its story through videos. \u201cEven a 10 or 20 second video is enough to help our consumers understand the function and efficacy of our products. We usually try to put in all the messages we want to deliver to our consumers.\u201d\u200b This marketing method has proven so successful for the brand, the company has hired an in-house team to churn out content. This year, the company will be focused on expanding its presence into South East Asia. Mainly, the company is focused on Singapore but it is also looking into Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand, said Yoon. Yoon expressed confidence in the male grooming market in SEA, stating that it was currently in a similar position as South Korea was before. \u201cIn South Korea, the younger consumers started to pay more attention to their looks, so the market grew very fast. We believe the same thing will happen in SEA countries.\u201d\u200b However, Yoon stressed the company does not plan to focus on men\u2019s grooming. He revealed the company planned to launch two new brands targeted at women: JULYME and BEQUE. JULYME will include skin, hair and body care products, while BEQUE will focus on colour cosmetics. Yoon said the company would continue to use its video commerce marketing method to launch the two brands in Korea and in SEA. \u201cWe have a proven track record. We know how to introduce products into market. The idea is to take our successful video commerce model and bring it to SEA.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u200b Copyright - Unless otherwise stated all contents of this web site are \u00a9 2023 - William Reed Ltd - All Rights Reserved - Full details for the use of materials on this site can be found in the Terms & Conditions Related topics\nBrand Innovation\nBusiness & Financial\nMarket Trends\nEast Asia\nSouth East Asia\nAsia in Focus\nSkin Care\nHair Care\nColor Cosmetics Show more  Content provided by Naolys | 07-Jul-2023\n                     | White Paper Naolys presents HairRevive [MM+Zn], a pioneering plant-based ingredient revitalizing hair.
