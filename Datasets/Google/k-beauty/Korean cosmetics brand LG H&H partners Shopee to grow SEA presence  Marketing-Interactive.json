This comes as LG H&H aims to\u00a0scale up its eCommerce business and capture new online buyers. The partnership will be led by Sean Lee, head of overseas business division at LG H&H and Chris Feng, Group President at Sea. Both companies will also work together and bring more brands under LG H&H onto Shopee, and identify new collaboration opportunities in areas such as marketing and exclusive product launches. LG H&H also aims to be top ten brand principal in the health and beauty category on Shopee. In fact, the brand had already launched some of its brands on Shopee such as The Face Shop, belif and su:m37 previously. Last month, it also launched its luxury brand The History of Whoo on Shopee Mall and Shopee Premium through a regional campaign in Southeast Asia. Shopee Premium was launched in 2020, and has scaled efforts to grow the premium segment by onboarding popular international and local premium and luxury brands, as well as elevating the customer experience with new features, Shopee said. LG H&H's Lee said that with Shopee as its key priority eCommerce partner in the Southeast Asia, the eCommerce platform will be able to provide deep insights on the local market landscape, and LG H&H can leverage its expertise of using data-driven approaches to understand consumer behaviours on eCommerce.
