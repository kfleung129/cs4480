    "text": "Daniela Rogulj July 18, 2016 Following the global trend and huge popularity of Korean cosmetics, the online store www.lily.hr has opened a new showroom in Zagreb called Lily K-Beauty.  It was only a matter of time before a showroom introducing premium K-Beauty products opened in Zagreb, promoting the so-called K-Beauty wave. K-Beauty is an umbrella term that includes premium cosmetic products and access to care, which in short term transforms your skin from the inside out. The Korean approach to beauty won the world over thanks to its innovative products, natural ingredients, and quickly visible results. Oftentimes Korean cosmetics are described as a premium product at drugstore prices. The concept of this new trade in Zagreb is a multi-brand showroom where products will be continuously updated, with new hit products and brands entering the rotation after testing. This way, the most exclusively efficient products will always be represented in the showroom. The showroom will be designed to function as a \u201cbuy online, pickup in store\u201d for customers in Zagreb, but also as a place for testing the store\u2019s products. Lily K-Beauty will be located at Amru\u0161eva 6 in Zagreb.
