And whenever there is a new beauty trend on the block, we look forward to trying it out, isn\u2019t it? So get ready, as we have yet another trend for you today; and if have dry or combination skin then this one is just for you! Slugging \u2014 the new trend \u2014 has taken the internet by the storm. But before you jump right in, find out what it is all about. What is slugging? Unlike the detailed 10-step skincare regime, slugging (thankfully!) requires just one step, and is tailor-made for those who love the \u2018glow-from-within\u2019 or the \u2018dewy\u2019 skin look. The basic principle behind this trend is to protect the barrier of your skin and making sure it remains hydrated which, in turn, will make it glow and look supple.

A post shared by Jennifer Casasola (@jencasasola)  This one-step, one product trend only requires you to apply a thick layer of petroleum jelly on your face before you sleep at night. The idea behind sleeping with a thick layer of jelly is that given its occlusive nature, the jelly will clog the skin pores keeping skin issues at bay. But, remember that this step works best for dry skin or combination skin. Begin by double-cleansing \u2014 a mainstay of Korean beauty (know more about it here). Once done, follow your regular skincare routine \u2014 toning, moisturiser, serum and then finally apply a thick layer of petroleum jelly and sleep! When you wake up, remove the remnants of the petroleum jelly with a soft napkin and there you have glowing soft and supple skin.

If done correctly, it helps the other products perform better, too.\u00a0This simple step also heals the barrier of your skin.
