    "text": "By Devon Abelman If you're unaware of the wonders of Korean beauty lip tints, let us educate you real quickly. First of all, they stay put forever and a day. You can swipe them on in the morning, eat a whole 12-inch pizza, and still have stained lips. With that in mind, they're perfect for those who prefer a low-maintenance beauty routine or the no-makeup makeup look. However, this is a major downside to them for some people. A majority of the shades available are vibrant, popsicle stain-like shades that are anything but subtle. A Redditor who goes by hoseokked wrote on the Asian Beauty subreddit, \"We all love our AB lip tints, but the proliferation of light or bright pink/red/orange shades are simply not wearable for a lot of folks who like a more subtle look, have darker skin tones, pigmented lips, or just plain don't like those colors on them.\" She went on to ask, \"What are your favorite lip tints that come in other colors? Which brands have you noticed come out with more of these types of nude or MLBB shades? Do tell!\" In case you have no idea what MLBB means, it's a fun acronym for my lips but better. Several of her fellow Redditors offered up their suggestions for K-beauty's best nude lip tints, and here are some of the most popular ones. If you have fair skin, Redditors suggest... \"The Innisfree Eco Flower Tint in Rose is my HG lip tint,\" lovelysile suggested. \"The thicker you apply it, the pinker it gets, but with just one thin layer, it looks like a really pretty MLBB-ish shade with a hint of pink. It takes about a minute for the color to take hold, so I just take a bit of it off with a tissue and get a really nice MLBB shade overall that lasts a while and fades evenly without being patchy.\" \"The new additions to the Holika Holika Pro Beauty Enamel Volip Tint are all MLBB colors, and they're fantastic because they wear off really evenly and naturally,\" amfiguous explained. \"My favorite is Victorian Red, which is more of a natural, brown/ dark pink on me.\" By Aliza Kelly By Gabi Thorne By Gabi Thorne \"On me, it doesn't look so light as it does in the photo they are using,\" auburrito said of her top MLBB lip tint. \"It's more a neutral peachy pinky brown on me.\" If you have medium to deep skin, Redditors suggest... This best of the best nude lip tints has a \"a nice dusty mauvy pink\" hue was suggested by jincesspeach. By Aliza Kelly By Gabi Thorne By Gabi Thorne A user called spaziobeat has olive undertones and loves this deep rose hue. \"The formula is great \u2014 super buttery, pigmented, and transfer proof,\" she explains. \"As long as my lips are nicely exfoliated, this applies really nice and creamy,\" melsautomatic said. \"I think the finish mimics the look of your natural lips, as it's neither glossy or matte. It just kinda melds in with your lips in the most flattering way. It applies fairly true to its color \u2014 a pinky brown that leans a wee bit more pink. My lips are naturally a darker plummy shade, and the color still shows well.\" By Aliza Kelly By Gabi Thorne By Gabi Thorne \"The new love of my life is Canmake's Lip Tint Jam in Cherry,\"  A Redditor named KomiHaruSmile wrote about the lip tint, which is actually from Japan. \"My lips are pretty pink/plum, and this gives them a gorgeous subtle tint that's just a little deeper than the natural color. I love it.\" Someone even offered up an application technique: \"I realize the best way to achieve something close to the usual MLBB is to apply a thin layer on bottom lip, smack lips together, reapply a little as needed, then use finger to just smooth it around,\" they wrote on the thread. \"Using the finger to spread helps to ensure even application without applying too much, and I think that helps tone down the brightness a bit.\" Noted.
