    "text": "Departments More Connect With Us  Going undercover as a Pacific Roller Derby diva is tough enough, but looking gorgeous while doing so? That requires extensive training in the field (of beauty). Last week's episode of Hawaii Five-0 proves actress Michelle Borth is an expert at both. In the new Spring issue of HONOLULU Shops (also viewable here), the new Honolulu resident shares her top makeup picks. Below, she reveals the go-to skincare products that help her look absolutely arresting.\n\n\n\n\n\t\"I think sun protection is the number one priority to maintaining healthy skin, so I never leave the house without sunscreen. My favorite is SkinMedica Environmental Defense SPF 50. It's waterproof and not greasy, like most sunscreens tend to be.\"\n$45, SkinMedica.com.\n\n\t\"A daily must-have for me is a proper moisturizer. My favorite is Mesoestetic Hydra-Vital Factor K. It's rich in vitamin E and biomineral salts and goes wonderfully under makeup.\"\n$66, SkinDirect.com.\n\n\n\t\"As an actress, I have to be in full makeup almost everyday, so it's essential for me to have a facial cleanser that can remove all that makeup without drying out my skin. I've found Osmosis Deep Clean Facial Cleanser to be the very best! It removes even heavy mascara but still leaves my skin feeling silky smooth and hydrated.\"\n$18, DermStore.com.\n\n\t\"I love how body oils give my skin an extra boost of moisture. My favorite is Fresh Sugar Body Oil \u2013 it has a wonderful light scent of rose and absorbs quickly into my skin.\"\n$45, Fresh.com and Sephora.\n\n\n\t\"Once a week, I like to give myself a deep cleansing mask to prevent breakouts. Peter Thomas Roth's Sulfur Cooling Masque is a wonderful clay mask that has aloe and eucalyptus in it and leaves my skin feeling extra clean.\"\n$40, PeterThomasRoth.com and Nordstrom.\n\n For Michelle Borth's top makeup picks, pick up the new Spring issue of HONOLULU Shops or click here, and catch Borth as Lt.
