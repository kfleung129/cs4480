By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJeff Benjamin Crayon Pop\u2019s viral hit \u201cBar Bar Bar\u201d may have hoped to have \u201cGangnam Style\u201d-like legs, but its two-week stint at No. 1 has been stopped by a singer from chart queens SISTAR. The group\u2019s lead vocalist, Hyorin, has reached the top spot with a solo track recorded for the soundtrack accompanying popular South Korean drama show \u201cMaster\u2019s Sun.\u201d The piano ballad \u201cCrazy of You\u201d showcases the diva toning down her Mariah Carey-esque belting in favor of a hushed, whispery vocal approach.

Remarkably, half of those No. 1s have come just this year, with Hyorin spending six weeks at the top, so far. With Hyorin snagging the No. 1 slot, that means Crayon Pop will have settle for No. 2. Just below them is EXO, whose single \u201cGrowl\u201d grows even hotter, hitting a new peak of No. 3 after four weeks on the chart. Bumkey\u2019s collaboraton with Dynamic Duo, \u201cAttraction,\u201d slips one spot to No. 4 after debuting a slot higher last week. Last weekend, Crayon Pop, EXO and Dynamic duo all performed in Los Angeles as a part of KCON 2013 and Mnet\u2019s special L.A. taping of K-pop chart show \u201cM COUNTDOWN.\u201d Girl group Kara return to the K-Pop Hot 100 with a pre-release single, \u201cRunaway.\u201d The light rock track precedes their officially promoted single, \u201cDamaged Lady,\u201d coming Sept. 2. Fans last saw Kara on the K-Pop Hot 100 with synth-pop single \u201cPandora,\u201d which peaked at No. 3 in summer 2012. The girls have actually found more chart success in Japan, earning two No. 1s on the Japan Hot 100 (\u201cElectric Boy\u201d and \u201cThank You Summer Love\u201d) since that time.   The four-member rock band CNBLUE\u2019s new track, \u201cFeel Good\u201d (released Aug. 23), debuts at No. 15 this week. As the title suggests, the single is an uplifting song with lyrics focused on the idea of freedom and fun. Member Jung Yong Hwa helped with production. The music video, where the boys perform and go camping, generated over 350,000 views since its Aug. 22 release. In other CNBLUE news, the quartet was selected as a representative band for Samsung\u2019s 2013 Galaxy Music Project, a marketing program that was created to provide an innovative way for consumers to approach music through various mobile applications.  The ballad trio 4Men\u2019s new soundtrack single, \u201cI Love You I Love You I Love You,\u201d for Korean drama \u201cEmpire Of Gold,\u201d leaps to No. 16 from No. 52 this week. The heartbreaking ballad was written and composed by member Kim Young Jae and expresses a man\u2019s regret at realizing his love for a woman too late. 4Men has released a slew of soundtrack hits, including \u201cReason,\u201d \u201cOnly You\u201d and \u201cI Couldn\u2019t.\u201d  This week K-pop also makes it mark on Japan with idol group SHINee\u2019s new Japanese single \u201cBoys Meet U\u201d at No. 2 on the Japan Hot 100. The high-energy pop track (that recalls the style of One Direction) marks the group\u2019s highest Japanese chart showing since their debut single in the country, \u201cReplay \u2018Kimi Wa Boku No Everything,'\u201d which hit No. 2 in July 2011.
