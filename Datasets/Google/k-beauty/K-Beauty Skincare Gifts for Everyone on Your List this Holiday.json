    "text": "View Our Print IssuesBack to Main Site  See Our Newsletters Share November has arrived, and we\u2019re *officially* gearing up for the holiday season. With so many loved ones on our list, it can be overwhelming to find a gift that\u2019s just right. May we suggest: the gift of healthy, radiant and clear skin? While you\u2019re probably already familiar with the delights of K-Beauty (sheet masks and essences and sleeping packs, oh my!) there\u2019s a good chance that your inner circle hasn\u2019t quite discovered Korean skincare beauty rituals yet. So treat them to the best of Korean skincare from cult-fave brand belif\u2014trust us, making your list and checking it twice has never been easier. If your bestie knows the joys of jet-setting around the world, she also knows about the parched skin that accompanies long flights, layovers, and jet lag. Treat her to belif\u2018s Moisture Miracle Set, a trifecta of *megadose* moisture containing The True Cream \u2013 Moisturizing Bomb, Moisturizing Eye Bomb, and Aqua Bomb Jelly Cleanser. Together they provide intense hydration for a healthy glow that\u2019ll take her from arrivals to departures and everywhere in between.  After long hours of squinting at the computer screen, your work wife knows the value of a good eye cream (if she doesn\u2019t, she\u2019s about to!) Gift her belif\u2019s Aqua Surf\u2019s Up Moisturizing Eye Bomb Set, which features a full-size Moisturizing Eye bomb and two deluxe minis of belif\u2019s best-selling moisturizers, formulated with hydrating comfrey leaf and elasticity-boosting pennywort. She\u2019ll feel pampered and extra bright-eyed at your next quarterly meeting, and have you to thank.   So your sis already knows the delights of K-Beauty? Then she\u2019ll really appreciate a super-hydrating boost to her winter skincare regimen (it\u2019s just what everyone needs during cold winter months). Your average beauty rookie may not appreciate the significance of a splash of a hydrating toner, but the truly skincare-obsessed will be over the moon with belif\u2019s Aqua Bomb Hydrating Toner, a Sephora-exclusive specifically designed for Aqua Bomb lovers, formulated with moisture-locking baobab and smoothing honeysuckle.  What to get the woman who gave you life? While it\u2019s hard to find a gift that compares to everything she\u2019s given you, belif\u2019s Youth Creator-Age Knockdown Bomb comes pretty close. This anti-aging serum comes in the form of a uniquely textured bouncy gel that fills in fine lines and pores flawlessly, and boosts elasticity for smoother, firmer skin. It\u2019s packed with ingredients like winter aster to support a healthy complexion and water pennywort to soothe skin. So you *might* just be Mom\u2019s favourite this year.  Ask any new mom about her sleep schedule, and there\u2019s a good chance she\u2019ll respond \u201cwhat sleep schedule?\u201d To make her precious hours of shut-eye count more, gift her belif\u2019s Aqua Bomb Sleeping Mask, an innovative jelly-pudding sleeping mask that replenishes fatigued, dull skin with a burst of hydration, giving her that \u201cI-just-slept-10-hours-straight\u201d look she craves. It has the power to rejuvenate and wake up skin overnight. The pillow-proof formula is lightweight and fuss-free, meaning mama can slather it on before bed and wake up feeling refreshed (even if it\u2019s at 3 a.m. to a baby monitor). Bonus: It\u2019s also great for warding off the \u201chungover\u201d skin after a night of cocktail-filled holiday festivities.  Whether you\u2019re close friends or friendly colleagues, your secret santa is sure to love the limited edition Ho-Ho Holiday Kit because it\u2019s perfect for every single skin type. The cult lineup features belif\u2019s must-have skincare minis curated to keep skin extra hydrated and glossy, so they\u2019ll be glowing all the way through winter and into the New Year.
