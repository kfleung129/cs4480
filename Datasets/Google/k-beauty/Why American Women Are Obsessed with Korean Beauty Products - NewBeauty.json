    "text": "For years, industry insiders have known that some of the most interesting things in beauty come from Korea. Everything was kept under wraps until the digital revolution allowed for American women to take notice. It all started with BB cream, the single product that put Korean beauty, also known as K-Beauty, on the map. Since then, interest in K-Beauty has piqued. Want to know where it all stemmed from and what\u2019s slated to be the next big thing? We\u2019ve got the story right here.

Skin care is the main focal point and it\u2019s\npresented in a way that makes it more enjoyable and relaxing than a chore.\nHealthy skin is the essence of a beautiful look, and Korean women go above and\nbeyond to get it. Hydration is so major that you will actually see women\nmeasuring their moisture levels with pocket-size moisture-level testing devices\nto keep a pulse on when their skin needs an immediate hydration boost.   Not all products are kitschy. Sure, some K-Beauty products are known for\ntheir cute packaging, but most items are packed with powerful ingredients and\nsolid at reasonable price points.   Korea is the new beauty superforce. Korea is the leader in beauty innovation,\npacing about 10 years ahead of the rest of the world. \u201cUntil retailers began\nmaking Korean beauty products accessible in the U.S., American consumers hadn\u2019t\ntaken note of all that was offered over there. Then, the dialogue about Korean\nbeauty rituals, new ingredients and product categories\u2014as well as word-of-mouth\nbuzz from consumers\u2014started to take off,\u201d says Alicia Yoon, founder of Peach & Lily, a K-Beauty e-tailer.   Korean beauty consumers are savvy. According to Charlotte Cho, founder of\nSokoGlam.com, Korean beauty companies are at the forefront because consumers\nare super picky about what they want and are quick to make judgments on\nproducts. \u201cKorean beauty consumers are savvy, so cosmetic companies need to be\non their toes and constantly churn out the best product at the best price. In\nthe Western world, there\u2019s not this same sense of urgency to innovate. For a\nproduct to \u2018make it,\u2019 it has to contain awesome ingredients and have\neye-catching packaging so that it really stands out.\u201d   It\u2019s more than a trend. \u201cIf it were just one product or trend that were popular, this whole K-Beauty sensation would just be a blip, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s\nbecome a lifestyle and a mindset,\u201d says Cho.   New products are on the horizon. There are a lot of new things coming out of\nKorea, and one of the newest is splash masks to improve skin texture.\nSplash masks contain botanicals, fruits and lactic acid to retexturize skin.\n\u201cThey take the 10-minute facial to a 15-second splash. You get an instant\neffect,\u201d says Christine Chang of GlowRecipe.com. Get it in Blithe Patting Splash Mask\u00a0($48).   And, new textures are coming out, too. Products that provide a 4-in-1 multitasking\nbenefit are big, and some, like  Shara Shara Honey Bomb All In One Ampoule\u00a0($40) have unique, jelly-like textures, too.
