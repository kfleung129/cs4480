    "text": "Fashion  It seems like every day there's a new it-beauty product or gadget on the market, but Korean beauty products have officially reached mainstream popularity. According to Fashionista, Macy's is launching a Korean beauty shop just in time for holidays, in conjunction with e-commerce site Peach & Lily. Known for curating the top K-beauty products for customers, the company is going brick-and-mortar for the first time. Ever since the rise of sheet masks, interest in K-beauty has reached a fever pitch, and now you won't have to take a chance online in order to see what the hype is about. Fashionista reports that the \"Peach & Lily shop-in-shop is set to debut next week in the Flushing, Queens, store in New York,\" so you can add the products to your holiday shopping list. Peach & Lily will host an in-house mini-store filled with gadgets and top of the line skin care finds. \"It was very much a conversation about what we thought and where we wanted to be. I really wanted to be in the Flushing location because skin care is really important there,\" Alicia Yoon, founder of Peach & Lily, told Fashionista. \"There are brands like Le Mer and Chanel and SK-II. It\u2019s so elevated and that really stood out to me.\" According to the Peach & Lily site, Yoon's Korean skincare education is a big part of why she wanted to start her online store. \"We started with Korean and Japanese beauty products and rituals because these amazing time-tested beauty traditions were largely missing from the beauty dialogue and shelves in the U.S. a few years back,\" Yoon writes on her site. \"Education and personalization are hugely important.\" So important, in fact, that the Macy's Peach & Lily locations will offer in-store beauty coaches that will check up with their clients to see how their skin is feeling. I call that excellent customer service! It's been a big year for K-beauty products. Check out some of the coolest Peach & Lily offerings \u2014 because it's about more than just sheet masks.
