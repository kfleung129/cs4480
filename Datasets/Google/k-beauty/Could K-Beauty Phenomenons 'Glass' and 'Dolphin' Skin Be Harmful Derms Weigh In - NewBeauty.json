    "text": "If you\u2019re anything like me, then having a clear, glowing complexion is at the top of your priority list. But achieving the status of having \u201cglass skin,\u201d which refers to a complexion that is as reflective as glass, or \u201cdolphin skin\u201d\u2014skin that looks wet and shiny\u2014might be more complex than it sounds. What does it takes to achieve the reflective face of our dreams? And is it actually harming the skin? Two top dermatologists weigh in. The LowdownOriginating in Korea in 2017, \u201cglass skin\u201d took social media by storm and has been trending ever since. It signifies the just-got-a-facial type of shine that just hits right, and if something is trending for three years, it\u2019s not just a fad. \u201cDolphin skin,\u201d on the other hand, is new to the game, and also praises the exfoliated and natural skin glow, but with a little help from the magical powers of makeup. \u201c\u2019Glass skin\u2019 refers to skin that is glossy, pore-less and smooth,\u201d says New York dermatologist Julie Russak, MD. \u201cIt usually refers to very well hydrated and healthy skin that naturally reflects light.\u201d Dr. Russak also explains that the younger and healthier you are, the more cytoplasm\u2014it protects the skin cells from damage and consists of 90-percent water\u2014you have, making it easier for your skin to reflect light. \u201c\u2019Dolphin skin\u2019 is achieved by layering silky primers and light-reflecting highlighters in multiple ways to enhance the high points of the face,\u201d notes Dr. Russak. While \u201cdolphin skin\u201d is more achievable due to the concealing effects of makeup, she thinks that rocking the glass skin look is always more beautiful, \u201cbut most importantly, having healthy skin benefits you in the long run,\u201d she adds. Steps to PerfectionAccording to Newport Beach, CA dermatologist Zenovia H. Gabriel, MD, you need to hydrate and protect your skin as much as possible to achieve the coveted \u201cglass\u201d look. \u201cFlawless skin begins with a foundational routine suited to your specific skin type and skin issues,\u201d she says, adding that your daily lineup should consist of a cleanser, treatment, moisturizer and sunscreen. Her go-to products? \u201cI love a gentle cleanser like the CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser ($15) and a moisturizer that includes ceramides or hyaluronic acid to lock in moisture.\u201d Dr. Gabriel adds that corrective procedures like lasers, chemical peels or injectables are another way to achieve tighter skin. For \u201cdolphin skin,\u201d it\u2019s all about the makeup. A product we\u2019ve been loving under makeup for bouncy skin is the Peach & Lily Skin Shield Blurring Primer ($34). Formulated with a plant-based silicone alternative and combined with potent vitamins, it serves as your skin\u2019s bodyguard and adds an extra layer of protection. Hydration StationThey look stunning, but could these trends be too hydrating or even damaging to the skin? The doctors say no. \u201cDehydrated skin is more of a concern than over-hydrated skin,\u201d notes Dr. Russak. \u201cDry skin means there is a decrease in oil production; dehydrated means the skin is lacking a protective barrier, and therefore cannot maintain internal moisture.\u201d Dr. Gabriel also notes that over-hydrated skin is not a very common complaint she sees from patients. \u201cThe skin should be moisturized twice a day to protect and plump\u2014moisturizers that include ceramides are the best for retaining optimal moisture,\u201d she explains. If you\u2019re concerned about excess oil, try a light cream like the Biossance Squalane and Probiotic Gel Moisturizer ($52). Bye-Bye Pores\u201cPores are an essential compound of skin health; they allow our natural oils to reach the skin\u2019s surface to provide a protective and lubricated layer,\u201d says Dr. Gabriel. But if they\u2019re really large, they can make your skin texture look much less smooth, which makes makeup application much harder. \u201cIf you want to shrink pores in a healthy way, take a deeper look at your skin: Do you have rosacea? Is acne an issue? Are they hereditary? This will help you pinpoint what your skin needs.\u201d Dr. Russak explains that using a retinol can help to decrease sebum production in the skin, which will shrink the pores. \u201cMicroneedling is a great way to achieve that glossiness, too,\u201d she adds.
