A petite woman with a short bob, Suh's understated demeanor hides her popularity in fashion circles and with South Korean celebrities. She\u2019s gone on tours with K-pop idols and worked on countless ads and photoshoots, all from the heart of the New York City Koreatown salon she co-owns with her husband. \u201cI like working with celebrities because I can be more imaginative,\u201d Suh, 44, told NBC News through a translator. \u201cWhen I work with a client in the salon, I work within the realm of what they want, but for stage you can be freer.\u201d RELATED: Korean Beauty Products, Once Niche, Are Entering the U.S. Mainstream The stage has been where much of Suh\u2019s work has been displayed. She traveled with Korean girl group the Wonder Girls and the Jonas Brothers during their 22-state tour in 2009 and more recently styled Korean singer Gummy as well as Kim Jong Gook and Haha, stars of the Korean variety show \"Running Man.\" Suh moved to the United States 11 years ago from Seoul, where she worked at a hair salon in the fashion forward Cheongdam-dong neighborhood. The move was difficult, but the city inspired Suh more than any other. Her salon reflects the inspiration, featuring a light fixture made out of musical instruments and a crystal chandelier. \u201cAt first it was hard to get business and adjust to New York City,\u201d Suh said. \u201cBut after I figured out that doing fashion here was really unique, I fell in love with the city. My eyes opened up once I came to New York. In Korea, there\u2019s a certain look that\u2019s trendy. But here, because of the diversity, there\u2019s so many different styles to work with.\u201d https://www.instagram.com/p/9bcZc_ual2 \"My eyes opened up once I came to New York. In Korea, there\u2019s a certain look that\u2019s trendy. But here, because of the diversity, there\u2019s so many different styles to work with.\" Suh\u2019s Cheongdam-dong connections helped her become the in-demand makeup artist and hair stylist in New York for Korean stars. JYP Entertainment, one of Korea's largest entertainment agencies, chose her to style the Wonder Girls over several other stylists. She remembers working with the singer Rain and actresses Lee Yeon Hee and Han Hyo Joo, but said she's worked with too many stars to recount them all. Other clients include Korean boy band TVXQ, actor Lee Min Ho, and Seattle-raised entertainer Jay Park. \u201cAt first I didn\u2019t really dream of working with celebrities, but then I found out that was the field I liked,\u201d Suh said. \u201cWhen you start doing hairstyling, people tend to go through a lot of slumps because it\u2019s so hard. For me it was pretty smooth. I got lucky, so I was able to dream big. I never dreamt of quitting.\u201d As interest in Korean beauty products have increased, Suh has worked on ad campaigns for the K-beauty brand Peach and Lily and drugstore cosmetic brand Kiss. The rise in popularity excited her, and she said her salon has been busier than ever. During New York Fashion Week, Suh had no time to spend at Kakaboka, working on location at fashion shows nearly the entire week instead. \u201cSince K-beauty became more popular, an increasing amount of people have come to the salon for Korean makeup,\u201d Suh said. Her K-Beauty\u2013America love affair goes two ways, she said, noting how New York City has changed her and others she knows. \u201cI think Koreans love New York City because there\u2019s more to see here,\u201d Suh said. \u201cThere\u2019s more arts, fashion. There\u2019s everything here. I\u2019ve been to Europe and other places, but there\u2019s nothing like the city. I feel younger since I\u2019ve been working here and work with young, fashion-forward people. I became more open-minded.\u201d RELATED: Filthy Rich Barbershop Gives Celeb-Status Cuts With a Hometown Vibe In the future, Suh wants to teach more people in New York about Korean beauty and launch a hair care line that will negate the damage done from frequent hair treatments, perms, and coloring. She also wants to help sustain the Korean beauty trend, which she is glad to be a part of. \u201cI feel really proud that Korean makeup is getting more popular,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to get my name out there more about makeup. I want to make K-beauty bigger.\u201d Follow NBC Asian America on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Tumblr. \u00a9\u00a02023 NBC UNIVERSAL ",
