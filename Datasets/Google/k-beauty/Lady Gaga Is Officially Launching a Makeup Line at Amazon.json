    "text": "In late 2018, Lady Gaga's hawk-eyed fans noticed a blank website called HausBeauty.com\u2014and immediately deduced the singer was launching a line. Today, we finally got a confirmation. Type in the URL and you'll be redirected to HausLabs.com\u2014the landing page for Haus Laboratories, Lady Gaga's very own makeup line. The singer posted a promo video today featuring herself and a set of diverse models all dancing in glittery makeup. Poised for a September launch, Business of Fashion reports that Gaga's line will include multi-use color products for cheeks, eyes, and lips in six shades, and a kit containing all three products at $49. Lip gloss sold separately will be $16. A full color collection is in the works. Considering how much of a beauty risk-taker she's been throughout her entire career, we can't wait to see what colors and products she will dream up. Gaga has partnered with Amazon, which will launch Haus in nine countries (including US, France, and Japan) simultaneously. This is the first major beauty brand sold exclusively on Amazon, which recently just launched its own in-house skincare line, Belei, in March. Gaga's line, of course, will be all about inclusivity and celebrating beauty in all forms. \"No message of self-acceptance, no deal,\" she told BoF. \u201cI have a platform in the world. God gave me this voice for a reason, I don\u2019t know why, I ask myself that question all the time, but I\u2019m sure as hell not going to put out a beauty brand that is going to drive insecurity and fear into people. This is about liberation.\u201d The Haus Laboratories team already has 15 people, with alums of Milk Makeup and Benefit Cosmetics. Gaga's very own longtime makeup makeup artist Sarah Tanno, who worked with Marc Jacobs Beauty as global artistry ambassador, will come on board as the Haus Labs' global artistry director. \"To do this with my best friend and my muse has been one of the most gratifying experiences,\" Tanno wrote on Instagram. \"I hope you all feel very empowered by what we have created and love yourself. Art is subjective, it\u2019s how you see yourself.\" Haus Laboratories will be available for pre-order starting July 15.
