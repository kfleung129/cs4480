    "text": "EXO's Chanyeol and South Korean model Lee Ho Jung shows off their acting chops in the music video for K.Will's \"You Don't Know Love.\" By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJeff Benjamin K-pop vocalist K.Will dropped the music video to his new single \u201cYou Don\u2019t Know Love,\u201d two days after dropping his fourth EP \u201cWill in Fall.\u201d The visual for the bouncy R&B track stars EXO member Chanyeol and South Korean model Lee Ho Jung. Chanyeol\u2019s starring role is sure to delight fans of the boy band who have only seen the 20-year-old\u2019s acting skills via an occasional cameo in Korean drama TV shows (like one this year in \u201cRoyal Villa\u201d with bandmate Sehun). The video details the breakup between Lee and the EXO rapper its inevitably frustrating, conflicting emotions. Watch below.

Watch as the pair try to keep their minds busy, doing odd jobs around the house while their minds keep returning to the happier times of the relationship \u2014 complete with the 20-year-old singer flashing a cute smile at each recollection. The video concludes with the duo returning to the spot they broke up and reunite to eliciting one more adorable grin from Chanyeol. As fun as it is to see the pairing of the model and the EXO MC, \u201cYou Don\u2019t Know Love\u201d is yet another music video in which K.Will does not appear. The K-pop crooner is a handsome dude, a 31-year-old who looks as fresh as any other idol singer. Perhaps by letting other celebrities take the stage in his music videos, it allows for his voice to be the aspect people focus on, instead of anything superficial. K.Will crooner certainly delivers the full package (look-, vocal- and stage presence-wise) when performing live. Watch a recent performance of \u201cYou Don\u2019t Know Love\u201d below.  K.Will has racked up two No. 1s on the K-Pop Hot 100 (\u201cPlease Don\u2019t\u201d and \u201cLove Blossom\u201d in November 2012 and April 2013, respectively). Look out for \u201cYou Don\u2019t Know Love\u201d and the \u201cWill in Fall\u201d EP tracks to shake up the chart when it\u2019s refreshed Thursday morning.
