Manila (CNN Philippines Life) \u2014 Being the \u201cNational Sweetheart\u201d is a label that Anne Curtis has arguably lived up to \u2014 what with her endearing attempts at singing, her contagious laugh regularly heard on a noontime show, and most recently, her obsession with K-Drama. \u201cThere are only [16] episodes and that's it. There's no season two, so you really get hooked,\u201d she says of the general format of K-Dramas. Indeed, it has inspired her many pastel outfits matched with ankle-length socks. She would even sometimes wear these looks with that vague half-cute, half-worried expression only K-Drama actors can seem to perfect. \u201cThere are only [16] episodes and that's it.

She would even sometimes wear these looks with that vague half-cute, half-worried expression only K-Drama actors can seem to perfect. Dressed in a baby blue peter pan-collared skater dress, she continues to gush about K-Drama: the locations, the actors, the actresses, she says, are all stunning. \u201c[K-Drama] teaches us about everything that they do \u2014 how their lifestyle is, their seasons, their culture,\u201d she explains, almost trying to contain her excitement.

She had told her partners at BLK how they should come up with this collection, as it still falls in line with what the brand is all about, which is \u201cuncomplicated beauty,\u201d the makeup\u2019s tagline.

But when you look at [their makeup], it's all very simple. It's not heavy, it's very light,\u201d she says. It seems Anne can\u2019t escape the value of makeup, especially with her line of work, but she also says that she\u2019s always been just \u201ca cheek tint kind of girl.\u201d \u201cWhen I see [K-Drama] actresses or actors, they're always so flawless.

While K-beauty looks effortless, another side of it is also known to be \u2018complicated\u2019 as evidenced by the aforementioned 10-step skincare routines, the \u201cglass skin\u201d trend, and even rhinoplasty and double eyelid surgical procedures. Anne is quick to say that K-beauty skincare is a whole different playing field, and what BLK is focusing on is how Filipinos can achieve a simple look through makeup.

Of course, there\u2019s an issue always hovering over the beauty and cosmetics industry in general, which is that it contributes to social pressures placed upon women to subscribe to unrealistic beauty standards. When asked about this, Anne goes back to reiterating the kind of simplicity that they are advocating for at BLK.

Even before the K-beauty collection, everything was very simple,\u201d she says. \u201cMy freckles were shown, I only used what was needed. No fake lashes, very uncomplicated. Because it means you don't really need much or [you can] keep it simple.\u201d \u201cIf you look at even our campaigns.
