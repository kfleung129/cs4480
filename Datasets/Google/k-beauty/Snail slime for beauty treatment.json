TOKYO, Japan \u2013 Having live snails crawl on your face sounds like the thing of nightmares, but in Japan, one company is hoping people will be prepared to pay for it. Starting Monday, July 15, women who want to slough off dead skin, clear their pores or roll back the years can submit themselves to five minutes of beauty treatment by these mollusks. \u201cSlime from snails helps remove old cells, heal the skin after sunburn and moisturize it,\u201d said Manami Takamura, a spokeswoman for the Tokyo-based beauty salon Ci:z.Labo, as she placed three snails on a woman\u2019s face. \u201cThis way, you can have 100 percent pure snail essence directly on the skin.\u201d Snail slime is believed to have an anti-aging effect on human skin, and some cosmetics are already sold with this essence. But Ci:z.Labo is going a step further in what it says is the first live snail treatment in Japan. As part of the salon\u2019s \u201cCelebrity Escargot Course,\u201d customers will get five minutes of snail therapy, along with massage and other facial treatments. The snail treatment costs 10,500 yen ($105.65). Sayaka Ito said she found the treatment so \u201cnice\u201d she almost fell asleep. \u201cYou can feel the snails moving on your face. At first, it is surprising, but it\u2019s actually rather nice,\u201d she said. \u201cMy skin really does feel smooth and moist.\u201d Tempted?
