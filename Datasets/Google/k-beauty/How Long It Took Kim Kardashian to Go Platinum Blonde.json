And if you have naturally dark hair, actually getting it to an icy blonde shade is also a commitment to basically a full day sitting in a salon chair. Just ask Kim Kardashian West. After revealing her new Mother of Dragons-like hair color, she took to her app to share her inspiration behind the change and exactly how long it took her to get there. Spoiler: It was almost a full 24-hours. \"I've been talking about going blond again for a long time, and I'm so happy I did!\u201d she wrote. \"I know a lot of people initially thought I was wearing a wig, but it's my real hair. My amazing stylist, Chris Appleton, dyed my hair and got it to the most perfect platinum, silvery-white color.\u201d VIDEO: Kim Kardashian West Looks Like Barbie in Skin-Tight Latex Dress at Tom Ford Chris Appleton is the same celebrity stylist who recently took Katy Perry platinum and is now even wearing a silvery color himself\u2014one that Kardashian has called \u201cthe modern version of platinum blond.\" To eliminate as much damage as possible, the first round of Kardashian\u2019s hair coloring took a whopping 12 hours. But that wasn\u2019t the end of it. \"The last time I went platinum, a few years back, I dyed it in one sitting and never gave it the proper time, so this time I sat there 12 hours straight. Then, we did another 5-hour session. In the end, SO worth it.\u201d On top of that 17 hours, Kardashian said she had to spend a week wearing yellow hair while adding Olaplex to it and conditioning it. Then, they toned the hair and lifted it to her current color. \u201cI\u2019m so happy with it and want to keep it a while!\u201d Knowing the Kar-Jenners, a \u201cwhile\u201d is one time stamp that is not so easily defined.
