    "text": "By Sarah Kinonen Obsessed with Korean beauty but can't seem to ever get your hands on the stuff? Well, get your credit cards ready because the wait is over. Peach & Lily for Target is set to hit stores later this month. As a refresher, Peach & Lily is a Korean beauty site founded by Alicia Yoon, and the brand is launching an affordable (and super-convenient) collection with the mass retailer. And if we're not mistaken, this is the first K-Beauty collab available somewhere as ubiquitous as Target. Now, who's excited? (We are, duh.) As avid fans of the (many) ahead-of-the-curve skin-care and makeup innovations Korea has brought us over the past couple of years (think: cushion compacts, face patches, and even cleansing balms, there's no question we're super-stoked to hear the best of K-beauty is heading to mass markets\u2014and to the holy mecca of mainstream, a.k.a. Target, no less. Beginning January 22, a 13-piece curated collection of Peach & Lily K-beauty favorites will officially launch at Target with prices as low as $3.50 for each of the three varieties (Calming, Firming, Lift-Up) of single-use Mizon Face Masks (center) and maxing out at the $38 Mizon Snail Repair Cream, which contains a stomach-turning and impressive 92 percent snail extract. Other highlights we'd suggest peeping out: The set of seven botanical-extract based Ariul Sheet Mask Skin Texture Improvement Facial Mask Treatment for $20 (left, above), the nourishing and antioxidant-rich Lagom Spray Skin Texture Improvement Facial Toner for $21 (right, bottom), and the hydrating ceramide-spiked Caolion Stick Moisturizing Facial Moisturizer for $16 (right, top). More K-beauty news: Peach & Lily for Target comes just a few months after the brand launched a self-branded collection, a trio set of hydrating and paraben-free sheet masks, aptly named the Dream Sheet Mask Collection, which, yes, we're still obsessing over. (Especially in this god-awful weather.) If you're as hyped as we are over the Peach & Lily for Target news, mark your iCals because the collection is set to launch on January 22 on target.com, and we see it selling out fast.
