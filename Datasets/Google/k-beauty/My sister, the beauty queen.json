MANILA, Philippines \u2013 \u201cShe was really nerdy\u201d is how Victor Young describes his big sister, Miss World Philippines 2013 Megan Young. Up until last August, the 23-year-old former reality show contestant and ABS-CBN talent was just Victor\u2019s ate [older sister]. Today, Megan is a full-fledged beauty queen. On Saturday, September 28, she\u2019ll be competing for the crown of Miss World 2013 in Bali, Indonesia. Victor is the second of the Young siblings, Megan being the eldest, and actress Lauren, the youngest. While Megan never really hid her desire to enter the entertainment industry from her family and friends, the world of beauty pageants was, Victor admits, something of a shock especially when they first saw Megan sashay down the stage in what has now become her trademark pageant walk or pasarela. \u201cI mean, I always see her in heels especially when she hosts events,\u201d explains the 21-year-old graduating college student. \u201cBut the full beauty queen look is so different.\u201d By \u201cfull beauty queen look\u201d Victor means the full blown hair, thick stage makeup, tan skin, dramatic gown and sky-high heels. \u201cI mean, I know it\u2019s her; she still looks like my older sister. But then just seeing her there on stage, especially during the long gown competition [in Miss World Philippines 2013], it was just overwhelming for me and everyone else we were with. \u201cWe all just wanted to cry. I\u2019d never seen her that pretty.\u201d He means this in a good way, of course. Victor describes Megan as \u201cthe typical ate: independent, protective, but not overly. She looks after me almost like another kind of mom.\u201d He adds, \u201cWe tell each other everything. It\u2019s exactly like how you would talk to a best friend or, sometimes, a therapist. We give each other advice.\u201d Now that a crown and a sash form part of Megan\u2019s daily outfit, there is, Victor admits, a slight difference in his older sister now. \u201cIt\u2019s like she became nicer,\u201d he says with a smile. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t talk to her, she just seems nicer. She now gives off that certain aura around her that she\u2019s a beauty queen, and beauty queens are supposed to be nice.\u201d Beauty queens are supposed to be perfect, too. \u201cSince the pageant, she became more cautious of what she does, unlike before. If you compare her with me, for example, I go out and hang out with friends, grab a few drinks. People don\u2019t know me so I can do whatever I want. But Megan has that mindset that people know her and that she has to be careful. But she\u2019s still the same ate for me.\u201d Victor describes to Rappler the moment he became the brother of the beauty queen: \u201cI remember talking to Lauren during that finals night, that Megan had so many awards, and that I felt like the judges were just going to give her all the awards but not the crown. But when she got the crown it was just, \u2018Wow. I can\u2019t believe she won.\u2019\u201d The change hasn\u2019t just been in Megan. \u201cOne positive thing [out of her win] is that everyone\u2019s getting together to support her,\u201d says Victor. \u201cIt\u2019s not just us, her immediate family \u2014 also our cousins, aunts and uncles. All of our relatives from abroad are actually getting together making Facebook pages, updating everyone, making t-shirts and are planning to go to Indonesia to support her.\u201d The one negative thing the win has done, though, is that \u201cwe\u2019re all separated right now. Lauren\u2019s always working, so she\u2019s never home. Meanwhile, Megan is out of the country. So the only person at home is me. We don\u2019t really get to see each other that often now.\u201d But they still get to talk to each other over social messaging apps. \u201cWe\u2019ve actually gotten used to it.\u201d As for his hopes for the upcoming finals night, \u201cI think the qualities any other person would want a beauty queen to have, Megan has: she\u2019s a good person, is giving, approachable and hospitable. I think those qualities will help her win.\u201d Victor points out with a sly grin \u201cif she says something about world peace, I think she\u2019s going to lose.\u201d WATCH: Rappler\u2019s interview with Miss World PH 2013 Megan Young Check out the childhood photos Victor shares exclusively with Rappler:         \u2013 Rappler.com  Rappler will LIVE blog the Miss World 2013 coronation night on Saturday, Sept 28, 7pm Philippine time.
