    "text": "From sunscreen to sheet masks. It\u2019s no secret that Seoul, South Korea, is a skincare-obsessed city. So, for Seoul Fashion Week, we asked four Korean models\u2014Sunghee Kim, HyunJi Shin, HoYeon Jung, Yoon Young Bae and Sora Choi\u2014to share their beauty tips. From their love of sheet masks to their diligent SPF beauty regimens, here is how these models look runway-ready at all times. Sunghee Kim @_sungheekim Product you cannot live without during Fashion Week: Dermartlogy Ageless Cream. I\u2019m using this product every day when cleansing, too. Good skin starts with: Drink water, and I\u2019m using Whal Myung Skin Elixir as mist and skin toner. Your ultimate Korean beauty rule: Most Koreans make sure to apply sheet masks two to three times a week.  P.S.: You can buy mask packs for $1 in Korea. HyunJi Shin @iamhyunjishin Product you cannot live without during Fashion Week: I have dry skin, so it\u2019s super important for me to stay hydrated! La Mer is great. Good skin starts with: My dad has always had great skin, so I think I\u2019ve inherited some of his great genes.  Every day before I go out I put on sunscreen\u2014it\u2019s the basics to great skin. Your ultimate Korean beauty rule: Water, sleep, and always remove your makeup before bed. Sora Choi @sola5532 Product you cannot live without during Fashion Week: Because I put on and erase makeup multiple times throughout the day during Fashion Week, I always prioritize basic skincare. I always put on sheet mask before I go to bed. Recently, I\u2019ve been using ones from Dr. Jart+. Good skin starts with: I always put on sunscreen, no matter where I go or what I do. Even when I\u2019m not planning on stepping out for the day, I put on sunscreen to maintain my skin tone. For daily moisturizing and skincare, my favorite is Dior Hydra Life; it keeps my skin bright and smooth. Your ultimate Korean beauty rule: I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a \u201cKorean\u201d beauty rule, but I try to have my makeup look as natural as it can be. Think your typical \u201cno makeup\u201d makeup, with slightly dewy skin, rather than looking too matte. HoYeon Jung @hoooooyeony Product you cannot live without during Fashion Week: Sheet masks. During Fashion Week, my skin becomes sensitive, so I always put on a sheet mask before I go to bed. It soothes my skin! Good skin starts with: Drinking two liters of water a day, washing your face only with water when it\u2019s morning, don\u2019t touch your face often with your hands, and make sure to wear sunscreen! I try not to give my skin a strong stimulation and I try to protect the fluids and oils that come from my body as much as possible! Your ultimate Korean beauty rule: I think Korean beauty seems to be more focused on skincare than makeup! Yoon Young Bae @mulan_bae Product you cannot live without during Fashion Week: Kyusoku Bijin Cool Refresh Sheet Foot Patch.  I use it after a day of hard work. If I put this on my foot or my leg, it will feel so refreshing and improve that body part\u2019s condition. Also, after any long-distance flight, that is the BEST thing! Good skin starts with: Oil Cleansing. I always use an oil cleanser, because it both cleanses and makes your skin softer.  I think proper cleansing is the most important thing for good skin. Your ultimate Korean beauty rule: Korean facial masks are the most popular and famous items in K-beauty. Use them well, and your skin will be as healthy as it can be!
