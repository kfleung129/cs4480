The actor, now rebounding from the nixed nuptials, told Cyrus \u2014 whose new hit \u201cWrecking Ball\u201d recently landed atop the Billboard singles list \u2014 that she can keep her $250,000 engagement ring as a symbol of their relationship, RadarOnline reported. Hemsworth was very involved in the design of the ring, going \u201cback and forth\u201d with designer Neil Lane until settling on a 3.5-carat cushion cut diamond in a vintage-inspired gold setting flecked with tiny diamonds, Lane told the Daily News last year. \u201cHe wanted something really romantic and beautiful,\u201d Lane said after the pair announced their engagement in May 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s really romantic, so she\u2019ll always remember the day he gave it to her.\u201d A New York appraiser estimated its value at a quarter of a million dollars. Cyrus, 20, was wearing the ring when she last appeared in public with Hemsworth at the Aug. 8 premiere of his latest flick, \u201cParanoia,\u201d in Los Angeles. The doomed couple confirmed their split Monday. For Cyrus, it was a personal low right as her new song reached the top of the charts \u2014 with a huge assist from the YouTube viewers. Billboard\u2019s charts now factor in YouTube views, and \u201cWrecking Ball\u201d did monster numbers on streaming services last week, getting played 36.5 million times \u2014 with some 92% of those views coming from YouTube. But in the twerking singer\u2019s personal life, Monday was a really bad day. At the same time the couple said they were through, Hemsworth, 22, was spotted leaving a Los Angeles house with Mexican starlet Eliza Gonzalez. A steamy snap obtained by E! News showed the pair locking lips outside her Beverly Hills apartment Tuesday. The \u201cHunger Games\u201d hunk reportedly stopped by Gonzalez\u2019s home around 3:30 p.m. to give her a piece of luggage, possibly one left at his house after they reportedly spent the night together following a rendezvous in Las Vegas last weekend. Sources told E! that Hemsworth stayed only for five minutes, but the duo \u201clooked very happy together, chatting closely before the kissing started.\u201d Gonzalez, whose full name is Eiza Gonzalez Reyna, is a 23-year-old actress and singer from Sonora, Mexico. She recently ended an intermittent, two-year relationship with Mexican businessman Pepe Diaz, announcing the split on Twitter Aug. 12. \u201d title=\u201dLiam Hemsworth spends time with Eiza Gonzalez after splitting with his fiancee, Miley Cyrus. \u201d data-src=\u201d/wp-content/uploads/migration/2013/09/18/XZ2DD456Z42X2YIIWFCQHCYBLY.jpg\u201d> \u201cI\u2019m single for more than a month!\u201d she told her 760,000 Twitter followers in Spanish. She said she was happy ending one cycle and \u201cexcited\u201d about the future. Her Instagram account includes dozens of selfies showing off her supermodel stems and long flowing locks \u2014 and also showcases her sense of humor. \u201cI\u2019ve been single for a while and I have to say it\u2019s going very well,\u201d reads one message posted three weeks ago. \u201cLike \u2026 it\u2019s working out. I think I\u2019m the one.\u201d According to E!, the stunner only moved to Beverly Hills about two weeks ago to pursue acting opportunities in the U.S. Some highlights of Gonzalez\u2019s career include her big break at 16 when she snagged a lead role in Mexican soap opera \u201cLola, Once Upon a Time\u201d and her musical efforts, which took off in 2008 after she recorded the first of her two studio albums. Hemsworth and Cyrus, who were together for four years, met in 2009 when they co-starred in \u201cThe Last Song\u201d in Georgia. They were engaged two years later. \u201cThank you for all the love today. I\u2019m happy to share this news with you all,\u201d Cyrus, who was 19 at the time, wrote on Twitter. \u201cI feel like all my dreams are coming true.\u201d Back then she was best known as the Disney star behind the blockbuster \u201cHannah Montana\u201d franchise. She later ditched her good girl persona and released the edgy hit single \u201cWe Can\u2019t Stop\u201d this summer \u2014 a grown-up party anthem complete with a racy video. Her provocative performance at the MTV Video Music Awards last month, which included simulated sex with a foam finger and twerking with \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d singer Robin Thicke, completed the transformation. Hemsworth didn\u2019t attend the Brooklyn show and reportedly was \u201cmortified.\u201d ndillon@nydailynews.com Copyright \u00a9 2023 New York Daily News ",
