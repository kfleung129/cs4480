    "text": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. A homeless man has embodied the spirit of Christmas by offering a student his last $5 so she could get a taxi to get home safely after a night out. Dominique Harrison-Bentzen, 22, was so touched by the man\u2019s gesture of kindness, she is now spending 24 hours on the street to raise money for him to rent his own apartment. Her campaign has been retweeted by former Stone Roses frontman Ian Brown. The British beauty queen has already raised a staggering $20,000 for the good Samaritan, who is known only as Robbie. Harrison-Bentzen told The Mirror the homeless man stepped in to help her after she lost her ATM card during a night out in Preston, in Lancashire, England. The University of Central Lancashire student said, \u201cI suddenly realized that I had no money and a homeless man approached me with his only change of \u00a33 ($5). \u201cHe insisted I took it to pay for a taxi to make sure I got home safe.\u201d RT @CurlyClaire13 Please donate \u00a33 to help Robbie #Prestonshomelesshero get a deposit for a flat http://t.co/WblgiEjrUL \u2014 Official Ian Brown (@ianbrowncouk) December 10, 2014  Harrison-Bentzen, a finalist in the Miss Preston beauty contest, was so touched by his act of kindness that she ended up posting a status on Facebook in a bid to track him down to thank him. \u201cHe has been homeless for seven months through no fault of his own and he can\u2019t get work due to having no address,\u201d Harrison-Bentzen told The Mirror. \u201cAnd I simply can\u2019t just give him the money, I have to go through the right channels. So I will be spending 24 hours through the day and night as a homeless person to understand the difficulties they face each day.\u201d It turns out that Robbie\u2019s good turn was not just a random act of generosity \u2014 the homeless man has come to the aid of many people in Preston, returning missing wallets to pedestrians and offering his scarf to keep freezing locals warm, The Mirror reports. Harrison-Bentzen said she didn\u2019t end up accepting Robbie\u2019s offer \u2014 but wanted to pay him back for his generosity, to her and others who have since shared their stories. ",
