    "text": "Ewan McGregor has a lot on his plate right now with both T2 Trainspotting and Disney\u2019s live action version of Beauty and the Beast both hitting theaters on Friday. He\u2019s a busy man and doesn\u2019t have time for the fuss over the gay character in Beauty and the Beast. McGregor, who plays Lumi\u00e8re, everyone\u2019s favorite candlestick, in the Disney film, stopped by The Late Show and when Stephen Colbert asked him about the some of the controversy over Josh Gad\u2019s character, Le Fou, who director Bill Condon said was gay, McGregor provided the vocal equivalent of rolling his eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s a gay character!\u201d McGregor told Colbert. \u201cIt\u2019s 2017, for f\u2013k\u2019s sake!\u201d The real shocking revelation was that McGregor admitted that he has never seen the original animated version of the film. \u201cI have never seen it, the original. Is it good?\u201d McGregor asked. Colbert couldn\u2019t quite believe the sacrilege he was hearing. \u201cHow could you possibly avoid Disney?\u201d Colbert wondered. \u201cHow did you escape from the black hole that is \u2018Be Our Guest?\u2019\u201d McGregor tried to explain: \u201cIt\u2019s not because I didn\u2019t want to,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026I don\u2019t know. It wasn\u2019t one that they watched, I guess.\u201d He then continued to say that not seeing the original was good for his art. \u201cIt was quite handy, in a way, because when you\u2019re going to play a part that\u2019s so well known, it\u2019s quite good if you don\u2019t know it so it can be yours. I didn\u2019t have to try and sound like the guy who did it in the cartoon in the \u201890s.\u201d Nice save, McGregor. Contact us at letters@time.com. ",
