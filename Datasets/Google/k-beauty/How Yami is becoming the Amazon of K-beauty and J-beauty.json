    "text": "With its new $50 million Series B funding round, Asian online marketplace Yami is doubling down on beauty. Last month, the 9-year-old e-commerce marketplace announced the funding round led by investment companies Altos Ventures and Balsam Bay Partners, which brings its total funding to $60 million. Existing investors J.P Morgan and GGV Capital also participated in the new round. Originally started as an e-commerce outlet for Asian packaged food in the United States, Yami has invested heavily in building up its beauty business. As the retailer has invested more in beauty marketing and ridden the wave of the K-beauty boom in the U.S., beauty now accounts for 35% of its total sales, up from 10% in 2014. \u201cThe beauty category is definitely going to get bigger and represent a higher percentage of the business in the future,\u201d said Alex Zhou, founder and CEO of Yami. \u201cMore non-Asian customers have started to recognize Asian beauty brands.\u201d The e-tailer sells over 30,000 Japanese, Korean and Chinese beauty products via a direct sales and marketplace model, with warehouses in both the United States and Asia. According to Zhou, K-beauty and J-beauty are the top categories, with K-beauty sheet masks from brands including Dr. Jart and Mediheal among the best-selling products. Prestige beauty is also popular, with SK-II sheet masks and Shiseido skin care also top sellers. K-beauty makeup from brands like 3CE is also popular. Zhou launched Yami in 2013 after spending four years as an international student from China studying in Kansas, where he was unable to find any Asian food at local grocery stores. He introduced the beauty division six months after launching food. \u201cSnacks and beauty are fast-paced Korean categories. That\u2019s why investors like to invest in this space because demand is growing,\u201d Zhou said. The platform launched beauty right ahead of the K-beauty wave in the U.S. According to Euromonitor, South Korea\u2019s beauty exports to the U.S. grew by 59% in 2015, for a total of $207 million. With the recent, massive popularity of K-beauty and Korean pop culture such as K-pop brands like Blackpink in the U.S., K-beauty brands have increasingly made their way into major beauty retailers like Ulta Beauty and Sephora. Yami differentiates itself by its \u201cdeep knowledge of the Asian supply chain\u201d and international freight, Zhou said. He added, \u201cbetter relationships with Asian brands\u201d means it \u201ccan offer more Asian beauty product selection at a cheaper price, compared to others in the U.S.\u201d The most recent funding round will be used to invest in talent, a mature supply chain, expanded beauty product selection and technology for customer research, said Zhou. It recently opened a Japan office, and it\u2019s in the process of opening a South Korea office and fulfillment center to \u201cestablish a direct relationship with all these Asian beauty brands,\u201d according to Zhou. Currently, he estimates 50-60% of the e-tailer\u2019s marketing budget goes toward beauty, working with influencers across\u00a0platforms including YouTube, Instagram and TikTok. While marketing efforts targeting U.S.-based Asian consumers are focused on promoting brands they are familiar with, Yami is targeting the entire beauty customer base in the U.S. via these social platforms. It is also investing in exclusive collaborations, recently launching a Yami x Ishizawa co-branded beauty box with the affordable Japanese skin-care label Ishizawa. \u201cFor non-Asian customers, we use different strategies [for marketing],\u201d he said. Those strategies focus on content, influencers and affiliate channels to educate them about new brands and products. This is especially useful for K-beauty, which has a rapid innovation pipeline, Zhou said. \u201cFor K-beauty, there\u2019s literally a new brand coming up every month,\u201d said Zhou. \u201cBut for J-beauty, [the industry] tries to be very stable.\u201d Get news and analysis about fashion, beauty and culture delivered to your inbox every morning.
