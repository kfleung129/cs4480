    "text": "By Sarah Wu Just when you thought manis couldn\u2019t get shinier than they already are, K-beauty is here to prove us wrong once again. We thought we had reached peak sparkle when we saw Gigi Hadid\u2019s shining, Swarovski nail art, but the latest trend to land on our radar makes crystals look dull in comparison, thanks to diamonds. Before you balk, know that we\u2019re not talking about real gemstones here \u2014 that\u2019s hardly an accessible way to accessorize your nails. Instead, diamond nails are an amazing update on the shattered glass nails trend we fell in love with last year. In case you\u2019re not familiar, the technique involves sticking prismatic pieces of cellophane on your nail beds, creating the look of glass shards. Some of our favorite examples came from South Korean manicurist and founder of Unistella salon, Eun Kyung Park. Naturally, she\u2019s also the genius behind this glittery upgrade. \u201cNEW #3D #leddiamondnail,\u201d she captioned the mesmerizing video, which we still can\u2019t stop watching. While she has yet to reveal the technique, we suspect she used the same, cut-and-paste method that gives the glass nail effect \u2014 but with holographic foils instead of cellophane. And, for an even easier take on the trend, you can always pair a holographic lacquer with a flake-finish topcoat. Shine bright! This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.
