To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. By Lauren Valenti At long last, Fenty Beauty is here\u2014and as usual, Rihanna did not disappoint. Nearly two years in the making, the singer\u2019s makeup range serves multiple roles, reimagining the basics every woman needs, such as blotting papers (yes, RiRi does, in fact, sweat) or foundation that makes \u201cskin look like skin,\u201d while serving up off-kilter offerings for those who want to go rogue in bad gal fashion. Would you expect anything less from a woman who wears a classic black smoky eye and shocking purple lipstick with the same aplomb? But to beauty\u2019s resident rule breaker, inclusivity is just as important as innovation. In Rihanna\u2019s case, that meant ardently fine-tuning formulas that work for all women, particularly with her long-wearing, shine-proof foundation, which comes in 40 different shades. \u201cI don\u2019t want women to [say], \u2018That\u2019s cute, but it only looks good on her,\u2019 \u201d says the star, who paired a canary ball skirt ensemble with an iridescent, gold-draped gaze, courtesy of her Match Stix Shimmer Stick in \u201cBlonde\u201d and Killawatt Freestyle Highlighter in \u201cTrophy Wife,\u201d for the brand\u2019s global launch party in Brooklyn. \u201cI wanted things I love that girls of all skin tones could [also] fall in love with.\u201d Her emphasis on diversity is also punctuated by her newly released campaign video, which features models of various ethnicities, including It girls Duckie Thot, Paloma Elsesser, Halima Aden, and Slick Woods. And rest assured, there\u2019s plenty more on the way. \u201cThere are endless possibilities,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re just going to have to wait and see.\u201d Ahead of the collection\u2019s global release on the Fenty website at midnight PST, here are the standouts every Fenty girl needs in her arsenal. *Pro Filt\u2019r Soft Matte Foundation Longwear Foundation, $34*\n\u201cIt has just the right amount of moisture and dries down to this soft matte that doesn\u2019t require a lot of powder,\u201d explained Rihanna of the featherweight formula, with its cutting-edge climate-adaptive technology. *Invisimatte Blotting Paper, $16*\nArriving in a lipstick-shaped compact with a hidden mirror for touch-ups, these fine blotting papers ensure skin that\u2019s photo-ready anywhere, anytime.
