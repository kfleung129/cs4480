    "text": "\"Is the time, expense, and effort really worth it?\" As a dermatologist who has\u00a0suffered from acne, I have\u00a0access to every\u00a0dermatologic prescription, but\u00a0my Korean\u00a0mother insists that\u00a0her\u00a0buzzy multi-step regimen is the remedy.\u00a0Like many Korean women, my mother\u00a0credits\u00a0her\u00a0flawless complexion\u00a0to the\u00a0super-intense skincare regimen\u00a0that American women have begun to adopt in recent years.\u00a0Studies have shown that South Korean women spend more money on skincare than dermatologic procedures. A traditional Korean skincare regimen goes something like this: pre-cleanse, cleanse, exfoliate, and then apply the following: toner, essence, ampoule, face mask, eye cream, emulsion and moisturizing cream. But is the expense, time and effort really worth it? Is there any science behind it?\u00a0What many K-beauty devotees don't know is that cosmeceuticals are not required to undergo stringent clinical trial testing,\u00a0unlike prescription medications, injectables, lasers, and devices. According to Zoe Draelos, MD, Consulting Professor at Duke University, the Korean approach to skincare has some validity\u00a0because, \"instead of using a strong surfactant, oil-based products help to\u00a0remove makeup, while water soluble products help\u00a0to eliminate any remaining makeup,\" she says.\u00a0\"The essence contains a humectant, which rehydrates the skin as so much sebum has been removed from the cleansing steps. A separate moisturizer is needed for the eyes because it is a dryer area, these products are usually more occlusive for more moisturization.\" While the jury is still out on 10-step skincare, one thing is certain:\u00a0An\u00a0arduous process\u00a0does not guarantee flawless.\u00a0Clear skin is\u00a0often\u00a0genetic\u00a0(and not all Asians have flawless skin). However, heightened skin-awareness\u00a0can improve bad habits such as\u00a0sleeping in makeup,\u00a0or skipping\u00a0daily sunscreen. Cleansing and moisturizing is essential, but if you don't use the treatments designed specifically to target your skin ailment, the likelihood of improvement with a skincare line is nil. \u00a0This is a skin care regimen to maintain your skin, not to treat chronic skin conditions. Consult with your dermatologist before incorporating such a regimen into your daily skincare routine. 13 Best Japanese Skin Care Products to Shop Amazon Is Having a Major Beauty Sale Right Now Why Matrix Could Be the Next Best Skin Treatment Claudia Sulewski Launches CYKLAR First Class Beauty 2023 The 14 Best Expert-Approved Setting Sprays Austin Butler Doesn\u2019t Think He\u2019s a Beauty Icon Jelly Nails Are Back and Better Than Ever The Best Spring 2024 Beauty Trends to Try Now Add These K-Beauty Prime Day Deals to Your Cart The 20 Best Pore Minimizers for Baby-Smooth Skin Laneige\u2019s Lip Sleeping Mask is on Sale Again A Part of Hearst Digital Media We may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. \u00a92023 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.
