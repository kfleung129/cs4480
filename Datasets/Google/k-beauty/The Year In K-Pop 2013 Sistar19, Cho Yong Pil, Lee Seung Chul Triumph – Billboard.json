    "text": "Sistar19's melancholic \"Gone Not Around Any Longer\" held the year's longest run for K-Pop No. 1 - and now it takes its place as the K-Pop Hot 100's top song of 2013. By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJeff Benjamin Last year, \u201cGangnam Style\u201d defined K-pop. Not only was the PSY smash the No. 1 song on 2012\u2019s year-end K-Pop Hot 100 chart, but it brought K-pop culture to a global audience. But in 2013, despite PSY\u2019s success, most Korean artists didn\u2019t succumb to copying to hit the top of the charts; opting for alternate routes to land themselves among 2013\u2019s top K-Pop Hot 100 entries.

Jam packed with clunky electro-pop, minimal drum\u2019n\u2019bass and drastic tempo changes, \u201cI Got a Boy\u201d was 2013\u2019s first new No. 1 \u2014 ending Lee Seung Gi\u2019s record-breaking, six-week reign.

While the genre mashing in \u201cI Got a Boy\u201d was smoothed over with peppy, oh-so-catchy hooks, other acts found success going darker: Sistar19\u2019s melancholic \u201cGone Not Around Any Longer\u201d held the year\u2019s longest run for K-Pop No. 1 with four weeks at the top \u2013 and now it takes its place as the K-Pop Hot 100\u2019s top song of 2013. BAE\u00a0CHI GI and Ailee\u2019s moody collaboration, \u201cShower of Tears\u201d was a winter smash and has come in at No. 4 on the year-end K-Pop Hot 100 tally. Monster\u00a0rookie Lee Hi compared herself to a thorny \u201cRose\u201d on her third chart topper; all of which utilized darker lyricism and chilling arrangements to hook listeners. But that doesn\u2019t mean K-pop didn\u2019t have loads of fun either. Girl groups like 4Minute, f(x) and SISTAR turned up the tempo to snag K-Pop Hot 100 No. 1s during the year.\u00a0And both 4Minute (\u201cWhat\u2019s Your Name?\u201d) and SISTAR (\u201cGive It To Me\u201d) have landed on the 2013 year-end K-Pop Hot 100 chart, at No. 6 and No. 8 respectively. THE BEST OF 2013: THE YEAR IN MUSIC MAIN PAGE The K-Pop Hot 100 also saw much-missed veterans return with feel-good tracks: Cho Yong Pil\u2019s \u201cBounce\u201d now owns No. 2 on the 2013 year-end K-Pop Hot 100. Lee Seung Chul brought bouncy synths for \u201cMy Love\u201d and has landed at No. 3 on the 2013 K-Pop list. Despite the colorful variety, the year\u2019s most unexpected success story comes from one who capitalized on PSY\u2019s hitmaking formula: Crayon Pop with their viral hit, \u201cBar Bar Bar,\u201d which earned the No. 9 slot on the 2013 year-end K-Pop Hot 100. The\u00a0rookie girl group hadn\u2019t even charted on the K-Pop Hot 100 with prior singles, but \u201cBar Bar Bar,\u201d with its quirky video, fun dance and catchy hook, sent the track on a slow, six-week rise to the top during the year. While the adorably-quirky \u201cstraight-five engine dance\u201d didn\u2019t catch international eyes a la PSY\u2019s horsey dance, it did captivate the K-pop scene to shoot the girls to domestic stardom. Last year, it was easy to pinpoint a track defining the 2012 in K-pop. One can\u2019t do that as easily in 2013. K-pop listeners showed lasting love for soundtrack ballads and uptempo bangers, supporting veterans and newcomers, embracing viral hits and honoring top vocal performances and proving that an artist showing a different side of themselves \u2014 whether as a soloist, in a sub-unit or via an innovative collaboration \u2014 can lead to big chart success.
