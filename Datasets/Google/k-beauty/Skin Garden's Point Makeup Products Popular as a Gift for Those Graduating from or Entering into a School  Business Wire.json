(Photo: Business Wire)  TOKYO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Skin Garden (http://www.skingarden.jp), \n      a K-beauty cosmetics shop located in Shinjuku, Tokyo, is crowded with \n      customers looking for gifts in the graduation and school entrance season.  From mid February, the graduation period, to April when entrance \n      ceremonies are held in schools, K-beauty cosmetic products are popular \n      as a gift item for those graduating from or entering school. For the college freshmen or those taking their first steps into the \n      \u201creal world,\u201d point makeup products to accentuate a single feature in \n      the face, such as lips, are popular rather than the overly fashionable \n      makeup. As a result of this trend, \u201cBerrisom Angle Lip Tattoo\u201d is very \n      popular in Skin Garden as a gift for people graduating from or entering \n      school. \u201cBerrisom \n      Angle Lip Tattoo\u201d is a lip gloss version of \u201cBerrisom \n      Oops! My Lip Tint Pack.\u201d It is easy to apply and the color is \n      long-lasting as if tattooed on the lips, which eliminates the need to \n      fix makeup. The lovely design that touches women\u2019s heart and the bright \n      colors add the popularity of this product. Skincare sets to moisturize the skin that has become dry because of the \n      use of heaters and cold wind in winter are also popular items for the \n      season. In Skin Garden stores, professional consultants provide \n      assistance so that the customers can pick out and purchase skincare \n      products that best suit their skin types. Jung Joo Park, Manager at Skin Garden said, \u201cAmong Japanese women, \n      K-beauty has been established as a trend. To reflect this, customers \n      looking for Korean cosmetics as a gift for people graduating from and \n      entering school are rapidly increasing.\u201d Continuously publicizing the technological power and excellence of \n      Korean cosmetics, Skin Garden, which has four branches in Japan, is a \n      K-beauty select shop offering over 500 varieties of Korean cosmetics \n      including Day By Day brand of Gyeongbuk Cosmetics Industry Development \n      Cluster.
