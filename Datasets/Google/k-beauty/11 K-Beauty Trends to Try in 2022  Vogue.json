So, what commitment will you be making to yourself in 2022? One good place to start is with your skin\u2014and the K-Beauty trends bound to take over in 2022. While eating clean and drinking less (especially after the holiday festivities), are obvious choices, let us make the case for specifically looking after your skin, the body\u2019s largest organ. And who better to advise on how to do this than the industry\u2019s leading K-beauty and skin care experts? From fermented tea and kombucha to red onion, these are the upcoming K-beauty trends you need to know about. \u201cIn 2022, there is going to be a lot more retinol-based skin care, and more unexpected findings on plant extracts that turn out to have beneficial properties, like red onion. On top of that, there is going to be a tremendous increase in awareness around the sustainable packaging and beauty movement.\u201d This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.  Then I Met You Birch Milk Refining Toner SOKO GLAM  Goodal Green Tangerine Vita C Dark Circle Eye Cream SOKO GLAM \u201cI think we will continue to see a move towards more vegan-friendly products and more sustainable packaging. It appears the market is moving away from sheet masks due to their single-use consumption, and more towards wash-off masks. I\u2019m also seeing many brands come out with more sensitive skin-friendly formulas and gentle, unscented formulations. Products featuring fermented ingredients which are known for their anti-aging properties as well are becoming popular, such as fermented tea and kombucha.\u201d  Benton Fermentation Essence SOKO GLAM  Skinfood Rice Wash-Off Face Mask SOKO GLAM \u201cI\u2019m seeing a big trend towards simplifying routines. Not that we\u2019ve abandoned multi-step routines, but multi-use products are really shining bright and catching people\u2019s attention. Any products that pamper the skin but also save time at the sink seem to be the new darlings.\u201d  Good (Skin) Days On The Bright Side Moisturizer SOKO GLAM  Beauty of Joseon Glow Serum SOKO GLAM \u201cMy trend for 2022 K-beauty would be more efficacy-based skincare products that highlight ingredients like vitamin C, retinol, and AHA/BHAs. With COVID-19 not going away anytime soon, more and more people are looking for ways to keep their skin in good condition at home after wearing a mask all day. [Look out for] multi-purpose yet efficacious skincare that can target different skin needs like anti-aging, skin brightening, fewer breakouts, and skin-smoothing.\u201d  Klairs Freshly Juice Vitamin C Drop SOKO GLAM  Isntree Clear Skin 8% AHA Essence SOKO GLAM \u201cVitamin A is still very popular, so I expect that more Korean brands will release retinol products in 2022. We will also see more skin care products that treat maskne, and makeup that is long-lasting which can be used while wearing a face mask, like transfer-proof lip products and cushion foundation that transfers less.\u201d  Dr. Different Vitalift-A Forte SOKO GLAM  Tony Moly Plump-Kin Retinol Eye Cream SOKO GLAM \u201cI see a rise in minimalist beauty, with formulas that contain no more than 10 ingredients for customers with sensitive skin. Brands like iUNIK are at the forefront of this trend. Sensitive skin is an increasing issue, and is definitely related to our stressful lifestyle and city pollution. \u201cThe pursuit of a healthy glow is very popular\u2014being confident in your own skin and focussing on healthy skin is one of the main trends in Korean beauty. Forget glass skin, opt for a simple routine with nourishing and brightening ingredients, like propolis and hyaluronic acid.\u201d  The Plant Base Waterfall Moist Balanced Hyaluronic Acid 100 SOKO GLAM  Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Oil Makeup Remover SULWHASOO \u201cIn 2022, based on consumer insights and what we see labs developing, I believe the big Korean beauty trends will focus on innovative ways for ingredients to be absorbed into the skin. For example, our Peach Slices Deep Blemish Microdarts deliver ingredients through our melt-tech. \u201cI also see continued innovation in sustainable ingredients and packaging, including compostable packaging for single-use items, like the Shangpree Marine Jewel Capsules. I\u2019m also excited for new kinds of ingredients that can be created in labs in a more eco-friendly way.\u201d \u201cSkin barrier repair and managing sensitive skin continue to be major trends. Delivering active ingredients and keeping skin dewy while calm will be big for 2022.\u201d  Peach & Lily Shangpree Marine Jewel Capsule SOKO GLAM  Peach & Lily Peach Slices Deep Blemish Microdarts SOKO GLAM \u201cFor the past decade, the demand for at-home and high-tech beauty devices, such as full-face LED masks and ultrasonic facial cleansers, has steadily increased. COVID has certainly accelerated this trend, with at-home beauty tech innovations now in demand globally. My prediction is that your next beauty product from Korea could come not from your typical Korean skincare brand, but a Korean tech giant, such as LG or Samsung.\u201d  Dr. Dennis Gross SpectraLite\u2122 FaceWare Pro DR.
