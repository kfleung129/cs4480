    "text": "Photo: Getty Images Mastering the perfect pout is no easy feat. (We admit, we are still diligently working on finding the balance between expertly pursed lips and just looking like an idiot.) Actress Keira Knightley, however, doesn't seem to have that problem. When she was filming her Oscar-nominated performance in Pride & Prejudice (2005), director Joe Wright famously put a ban on her signature pout. (It's rough when you are too good-looking for a role, isn't it?) But Knightley revealed on Graham Norton's television show yesterday that when the two joined forces on the Chanel ad campaigns in 2011, Wright begged for those plump lips to come back. \"We started doing Chanel adverts and he was like 'You know that pout we banned? Can we have it back and as much as possible?'\" she explained.  And of course, she nailed it. (She did it so well that the ad was eventually criticized being overly sexual.) Keira, teach us how to pout?
