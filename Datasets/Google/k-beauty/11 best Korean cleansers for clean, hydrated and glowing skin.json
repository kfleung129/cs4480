    "text": "Korean beauty products are the newest fad, and their water-based cleansers are amongst the best. These cleansers do a fantastic job of taking off dirt and grime from the face while maintaining the skin\u2019s pH balance, and come in such a wide range of formulations that you\u2019re bound to discover something that works well for your skin \u2013 without any adverse side effects. Before we dive right into our favourite water-based cleansers, we want to reiterate that a good rule of thumb for fabulous skin is to always cleanse it thoroughly, whether you have makeup on or not. The crucial step not only gets rid of all of the excess dirt, makeup, and impurities you\u2019ve accumulated throughout the day, but also helps prevent\u00a0breakouts, skin fatigue, and premature ageing in the long run. Korean cleansers are one of the best because they\u2019re not only known to be gentle, but also nourishing and pH-balancing, so your skin won\u2019t be stripped of its natural moisture. Instead, you\u2019ll be left with a clean canvas for the rest of your Korean skincare routine, such as essences, sheet masks, and moisturisers. Cleansers from K-beauty brands are known to be highly effective, and the majority of them are made with natural ingredients. And if you\u2019re looking to get into the double cleansing method that all South Koreans live by, here\u2019s a good place to start. The\u00a0two-step routine requires you to wash your face with an oil-based cleanser first, followed by a water-based cleanser. The first step draws out oil-based impurities such as SPF, sebum, and pollutants while the second step strips off debris like sweat and dirt. It\u2019s said to be an essential step in achieving the clear, glass skin that many\u00a0Korean celebrities and K-pop stars flaunt. Formulated with Jeju volcanic clusters, this\u00a0daily cleansing foam promises to remove impurities in the pores and absorbs excess sebum to keep your face clean. Its rich and plush whipped cream-like lather helps thoroughly cleanse and leaves skin feeling fresh after cleansing, without the typical tightness that most cleansers bring. If you have sensitive skin, you can\u2019t risk using the wrong products or something that is too harsh on it. Klairs Rich Moist Foaming Cleanser contains amino acids, which makes\u00a0it exceptionally mild and keeps your skin hydrated after each wash. The formulation contains hyaluronic acid, ceramides, and olive oil, which moisturise your skin without causing irritation. If you like foamy cleansers, this one\u2019s for you. The\u00a0gentle brightening cleansing foam is enriched with rice extracts and works up into a whipped cream like-texture to thoroughly cleanse your skin. The natural rice water solution also brings brightening properties, so you\u2019re left with glowing, radiant skin after each wash. A rich source of copper peptides, snail secretion filtrate \u2013 a key ingredient in\u00a0Mizon\u2019s Snail Cushion Foam Cleanser\u00a0\u2013 is renowned for its ability to accelerate healing and optimise cellular repair and renewal processes, so skin appears smooth, firm and luminous. The deep-cleansing formula lathers into a slightly \u2018sticky\u2019 foam that clings to impurities and helps to purify pores and diminish the visibility of blackheads. Hydrating and softening is the perfect first step in the Mizon \u2018snail repair\u2019 ritual and the perfect way to clarify all complexions without leaving skin feeling taut, dry or uncomfortable. Infused with nourishing duckweed, brightening citrus peel, and extracts harvested from the delicate inner shells of chestnuts, this cleanser lathers into a rich foam thanks to nonionic cleansing components to give a deeper cleanse while leaving skin hydrated, soft and balanced. Ideal for normal, combination and oily skin types, it washes away to leave a semi-dewy finish and a refreshed, hydrated feel. Wipe away the day with COSRX\u2019s Low-pH \u2018Good Morning\u2019 gel cleanser. Smooth and lightweight, this Korean cleanser is one of the best in the market today, and glides across your skin to effortlessly removing any trace of makeup, SPF or grime. The formula works to respect the natural 5-6 pH level that your skin requires, allowing the botanical ingredients to effectively cleanse without leaving your base stripped of natural essential oils. The Korean water-based cleanser has a unique cream-to-foam formula that, when applied, penetrates the pores and eliminates acne, blackheads, and dead skin cells, leaving behind flawlessly hydrated skin. Charcoal is present here, and helps\u00a0remove dirt and oil from the pores, while zinc calms the skin. The antioxidant qualities of the mushroom in this Korean cleanser works as a protective barrier for the skin. Made with 70% tea tree leaf water, this cleansing water goes beyond simply removing stubborn makeup and impurities. It also protects the skin with acne-fighting tea tree leaf extract oil alongside the tea tree water.

The award-winning Saem Healing Tea Garden Tea Tree Cleansing Water\u00a0is a one-step skin-friendly cleanser that doesn\u2019t require rinsing off, and works to eliminate pollutants and makeup while regulating sebum levels on the pores. The water-based product contains\u00a0Australian tea tree ingredient that removes excessive sebum in pores, as well as edelweiss flower, mallow flower and alchemilla vulgaris extracts to soothe the skin after a long day. The amazing blend of ingredients in Neogen Green Tea Real Fresh Foam Cleanser makes it ideal for oily, combination, or acne-prone skin. The core component is fermented green tea extract, which soothes, calms, brightens, moisturises, and nourishes the skin.
