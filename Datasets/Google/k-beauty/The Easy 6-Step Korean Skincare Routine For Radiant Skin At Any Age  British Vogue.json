By Hannah Coates Regardless of our age, when it comes to our skin, we\u2019re all on a quest for the same thing: a plump, glowing, and healthy complexion. In Korea, they call it \u201cchoc-choc\u201d, explains facialist and founder of 001 Skincare Ada Ooi, who counts everyone from Lady Gaga to Rooney Mara as clients. Far from the elaborate, 12-step K-Beauty skincare regimes you\u2019ve heard about, Ooi believes that skin like this can be achieved with half the number of steps. All you need is to know how \u2013 and in what order \u2013 to properly apply your products. Here, she shares her six-step skincare regime for your juiciest skin ever. By Georgia Day As with any good facial, your first step should be cleansing the skin effectively. To remove your make-up, look to a formula like Augustinus Bader\u2019s The Cream Cleansing Gel (\u00a350, Selfridges), or Comfort Zone\u2019s sumptuous Sacred Nature Cleansing Balm (\u00a344, Selfridges) to lift grime from the face, and use a muslin cloth to wash it off. Next, Ooi recommends using the AHC Aqualuronic Cleanser (\u00a318, LookFantastic) to double cleanse. \u201cIt\u2019s very different from most foaming cleansers \u2013 it starts foamy, but add some water and it has a very creamy texture, which means it doesn\u2019t dry out your skin,\u201d she says. She advises looking for cleansers that, like this one, contain hyaluronic acid molecules in a number of different sizes, as they create water pathways through which subsequent active ingredients can successfully make their way into the skin. If you thought toner was a thing of the past, think again. \u201cToning is one step that has been neglected in the UK for far too long, but in K-beauty it\u2019s extremely important,\u201d says Ooi. \u201cAfter you\u2019ve cleansed your face, your skin\u2019s pH will be all over the place \u2013 especially in England where the water is hard. When water is hard it means that even the gentlest of cleansers can be quite harsh to skin.\u201d Toning helps to balance out the skin\u2019s pH (it is naturally slightly acidic), which is important for a strong skin barrier. The toning step is also a chance to hydrate while the skin is still warm and pores are open after cleansing. Look for ultra-hydrating toners \u2013 avoid anything astringent or with alcohol\u00a0\u2013 with ingredients like hyaluronic acid, coconut water and vitamins, like Elemis Superfood Kefir-Tea Mist (\u00a325.95, BeautyBay). Ooi advocates adding a few drops into the palms of hands and then patting and pressing it into the skin. \u201cThis will help ensure all the formula sinks into the skin, rather than sitting on top of it, evaporating and taking the water in the skin with it. If you think about the motion of tapping and pressing, you can imagine how molecules will just roll into the pores. It\u2019s very important.\u201d By Hannah Coates If you suffer from acne however, applying it with a cotton wool pad is your best bet, Ooi says, pointing out that areas of acne indicate an imbalance of sebum that needs to be remedied. \u201cThink of the skin as a series of fish scales\u00a0\u2013\u00a0all the scales (or cells) should be aligned. If, however, you have a scab, blemish or cystic spot, the scales are misaligned, and water comes out and pollution and bacteria seep in. You need to fill those gaps with good, balancing products, like toner.\u201d Those with blemish-prone skin are especially likely to benefit from Medik8\u2019s new Press & Glow Daily Exfoliating PHA Tonic (\u00a325, SpaceNK), which is super-gentle and helps to keep the skin\u2019s surface clear and healthy while hydrating, unlike some acid toners which can over-strip the skin. By Alice Cary By Hannah Jackson By Hannah Coates Emulsion? What\u2019s that? In skincare, an emulsion is a lightweight, semi-transparent lotion that works to deeply hydrate the skin. \u201cSixty-five per cent of our skin is water, the rest is oil,\u201d says Ooi. \u201cThe emulsion step is to replenish the lipids and oil in the skin.\u201d As you did your toner, press the emulsion into skin \u2013 not forgetting the neck \u2013 and look for formulas that contain hyaluronic acid, ceramides and botanical extracts. We love DHC\u2019s Urumai Lotion (\u00a322, LookFantastic) and Origins Dr Andrew Weil Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion (\u00a332, Selfridges). Next up, it\u2019s serum time. The main criteria here is that you look after your skin and its specific needs. Hydration is always key, so a good hyaluronic acid serum, like Elizabeth Arden\u2019s Hyaluronic Acid Ceramide Capsules (\u00a345, LookFantastic), will suit every skin type. Other excellent serums to try are Aurelia Probiotics CBD Super Serum (\u00a364, CultBeauty) to calm, balance and hydrate, and Volition Strawberry-C Brightening Serum (\u00a336, CultBeauty) to boost radiance. While in Asia the concept of an eye cream for the face is now run-of-the-mill, we\u2019re just waking up to it over here. \u201cUsually eye creams contain more potent ingredients like peptides, and they\u2019re not as concentrated in the face creams,\u201d says Ooi. \u201cBut these new hybrid products are designed to be used all over, to help soften fine lines and wrinkles.\u201d L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s new Revitalift Filler Eye Cream For Face (\u00a319.99, LookFantastic) is packed with hyaluronic acid and works to plump, fill fine lines and hydrate, while AHC\u2019s Eye Cream For Face (\u00a326, LookFantastic) is full of vitamins and peptides to firm and nourish. \u201cEyes are one place where massage can really help. We look at our phones and sit in front of the computer for a long time each day, and our muscles around them cannot relax \u2013 even if you tell them to relax, they can\u2019t. That\u2019s why you get eye bags and \u201811\u2019 lines between your brows,\u201d she says. For a simple DIY massage, try pressing your thumb down on the inside tip of both brows to release tension, then pinch along the eyebrows. Then, use fingertips to gently circle the eye, moving along the cheekbones to inner corners. Ensure you don\u2019t drag the skin, and finish by pressing your temples. By Alice Cary By Hannah Jackson By Hannah Coates The last step in your routine is designed to seal in all of the products you\u2019ve used, and awaken and energise the face. \u201cYou want to do some vigorous massage at this point, to help your skin face the day,\u201d says Ooi. \u201cLoosen your wrists and just pat around your face. Jaw muscles are typically tense so break that tension down \u2013 use your knuckles to knead it.\u201d After applying your moisturiser, take your first two knuckles on either side of the jawline and draw them back towards the ear, working into any areas of tension. Shiseido\u2019s Enmei Ultimate Renewing Cream (\u00a3410, Harrods) is excellent for this, and although it is expensive, has been clinically proven to renew and energise skin. Kiehl\u2019s Super Multi-Corrective Cream (\u00a355, Selfridges) is another excellent cream that works well on all skin types, helping to boost elasticity and even skin tone.
