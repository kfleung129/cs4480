    "text": "Kim Ressler, a Corona del Mar resident, watched as a smart mirror scanned her reflection and analyzed her skin\u2019s problem areas. Then the mirror listed recommendations for skincare products available in Beautytap\u2019 store. The popular Korean beauty website has moved to a new retail location in South Coast Plaza. The company previously operated a pop-up store in the mall in 2018, and now has a shop in the beauty department at Bloomingdale\u2019s. Over 350 people attended the grand opening event, called K Beauty Pop, on Oct. 26, which included panels about the K-beauty regimen and the global rise of Korean culture. Guest speakers included \u201cLive from E!\u201d co-host Melanie Bromley, \u201cThe LadyGang\u201d podcast and TV show co-host Keltie Knight, legendary UCLA gymnastics coach Valorie Kondos Field, celebrity photographer MJ Kim and guitarist Se-Hwang Kim (formerly with N.E.X.T.), along with multiple fashion and beauty influencers. \u201cWe\u2019re in the day and age where we all need something personal to us, [but] we don\u2019t know what products we need,\u201d Ressler said. \u201cWe all need something different. Seeing what it says about your skin, and seeing what you need where is awesome. It\u2019s closer to personal than anything else.\u201d Beautytap CEO James Sun helped Ressler interpret her results. According to the mirror\u2019s report, her greatest concerns are large pores and dark circles, but overall, her skin is in good shape. \u201cIt\u2019s not God,\u201d Sun said of the smart mirror, \u201cBut it helps with analysis.\u201d The use of smart mirrors at Beautytap reflects Sun\u2019s goals for the company: a focus on technology and an improved buying process. A tech entrepreneur and 2005 finalist on Donald Trump\u2019s TV series, \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d Sun said that most retailers\u2019 beauty counters cater more to the brands they sell then to customers. Brands pay retailers to display their entire product lines en masse on counters or shelves, Sun said. \u201cBut now, if you look at the consumer, look at Instagram: when a lady or a guy puts a photo of their skincare or cosmetics regimen, you don\u2019t ever see one brand,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see six to 10 different products, and from different brands.\u201d In order to allow Beautytap\u2019s customers greater flexibility to mix and match their products, the company doesn\u2019t allow brands to pay for shelf or counter space in the store. According to the website, a sourcing team in Korea seeks out products based on innovation, and tests each one before deciding whether or not to carry in store. Products are organized by their order in the K-beauty process and the skincare need they address, then displayed at three different price points \u2014 affordable, medium and premium. That way, customers can easily formulate a beauty routine based on their skin concerns and budgets. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do that with [products from] Tom Ford or Clinique; we have to carry the whole line,\u201d said Preston Antonini, vice president and general manager of Bloomingdale\u2019s. \u201cI think that\u2019s the way the new shopper is looking at things, this personalized regimen.\u201d Sun and Beautytap\u2019s ultimate mission, though, is to introduce the world to Korean culture through the business. \u201cMy philosophical goal is really around trying to use beauty products as a way of promoting diversity and multiculturalism,\u201d said Sun, who is Korean American. \u201cBecause you\u2019re using products from Asia, you\u2019re learning about them and learning about other cultures, and you\u2019re being more tolerant.\u201d For Minji Cho, the co-founder of the Los Angeles based K-beauty content company Seoul of Skin, Korean beauty products aren\u2019t anything new. But having a physical store dedicated to them in Orange County is. \u201cI think K-beauty has been on the rise for a really long time, but having this event at Bloomingdale\u2019s shows that it\u2019s not a trend that\u2019s going to be here and gone,\u201d said Cho, who grew up in Seoul, South Korea. \u201cSeoul, I would say, is where women are the most obsessed with skincare and put in the most effort. And due to that kind of market, it has the most innovation and variety of products. So I think it shows that this K-beauty phenomenon is here to stay and will grow more.\u201d Support our coverage by becoming a digital subscriber. All the latest on Orange County from Orange County.
