By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJeff Benjamin Davichi stays strong at No. 1 for a second consecutive week, thwarting 2NE1\u2019s quest to snag the coveted spot. The duo, under Core Contents Media, has been killing the charts with various tracks this year, including \u201cTurtle,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Drink\u201d and \u201cBe Warmed,\u201d showing no signs of slowing down with the girls recently speaking about already planning their next album.

The track had a big debut last week, shooting up to No. 11 without a full week of sales, and missing No. 1 could be attributed to timing. 2NE1 has announced plans to release one single every month until October, making future chart toppers likely. The foursome can take solace in the fact they have earned over 6 million more music video views as \u201cFalling in Love\u201d approaches the 7 million mark.

Female soloist Ailee makes a big return on the charts with her comeback single, \u201cU&I.\u201d Vocally, the track plays off the same approach as Christina Aguilera and Beyonce with an old jazz throwback sound. The video showcases Ailee\u2019s fiercest look yet with high-fashion outfits showing off her legs, colorful eyeliner and a striking new red \u2018do. While solo singles \u201cHeaven\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll Show You\u201d peaked at Nos. 3 and 2 respectively, Ailee did earn her first K-Pop Hot 100 with her feature on BAE CHI GI\u2019s \u201cShower of Tears.\u201d Her singles have had proven longevity too. Don\u2019t count the Jersey native out for the top spot just yet.   Male soloist Jay Park storms the chart with his recently released single, \u201cI Like 2 Party,\u201d at No. 13 this week. The track was first previewed in Korea after being selected as the ending theme song for the premiere of Will Smith\u2019s new movie, \u201cAfter Earth.\u201d The song was produced by Jay Park and longtime friend Cha Cha Malone. The song has a powerful beat with heavy electro sounds topped off with an infectious hook, a perfect fit for the summer. In the music video, Jay Park flaunts his sculpture-like body and nimble dance moves, crooning and partying, with women in fun costumes and colorful wigs. The clip has scored nearly 700,000 clicks since its release on July 9 and also features a cameo from famous celebrity jeweler Ben Baller. Jay Park also represents K-pop as his EP \u201cI Like 2 Party\u201d debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard World Album charts. He even beats our popular Japanese pop artist KyaryPamyuPamyu\u2019s album \u201cNanda Collection.\u201d  Other chart highlights include Brown Eyed Girls\u2019 \u201cRecipe\u201d zooming up to No. 7 from No. 31.
