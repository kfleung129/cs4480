    "text": "The global club for creatives is now taking on the beauty industry. Here at LSA HQ, we\u2019re big fans of Soho House. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m allowed to say this, but our Editor-in-Chief is always there drinking tequila sodas and our Social Media Manager regularly hosts events in collaboration with the Hong Kong house. But before you accuse us of any sort of bias, let me just say I\u2019m clean. Guys, I\u2019m not even a member. So today\u2019s article is definitely not slanted; it\u2019s simply what I thought was some pretty cool news. In case you haven\u2019t heard \u2014 and you probably haven\u2019t, because it hasn\u2019t even been announced to members yet \u2014 the global hospitality brand and private members\u2019 club is branching out into the beauty space. Yup, that\u2019s right, Soho House is releasing its own skincare line. And it\u2019s named Soho Skin, naturally. First, like Aesop, Le Labo and our all other favourite genderless scent creators, Soho Skin\u2019s collection caters to all sexes \u2014 so inclusive! Next, it was developed not only by professionals, but also Soho House members themselves. The community was asked about their skincare goals and what they felt was missing in the current beauty market. All this makes me feel like Soho House is really onto something with its new venture. Ten hyper-functional products, designed to be used both at home or during your travels, come with the debut of Soho Skin. They include a cream cleanser, an eye cream, a face cream, a shaving gel, an exfoliant treatment and a brightening renewal serum. The complete Soho Skin collection is now available in all Soho House bedrooms and online via the\u00a0brand\u2019s website.
