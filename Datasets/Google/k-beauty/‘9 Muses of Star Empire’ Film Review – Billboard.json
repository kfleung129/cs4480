By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJeff Benjamin  K-pop haters will completely shift their paradigm after watching \u201c9 Muses of Star Empire.\u201d The eye-opening documentary \u2014 which makes its North American premiere on July 26 (more info below) \u2014 shows what goes into creating an act for the market. It follows the story of Korean record label Star Empire Entertainment, which spends more than a million dollars to debut girl group 9 Muses in 2010. If the story truly represents what goes on behind the K-pop scenes, then there\u2019s lots of tears, disappointment and rehearsing until you\u2019re sick. Playing off their Greek goddess-inspired name, 9 Muses are marketed as nine model-esque girls crafting sexy, sassy K-pop. While the viewer does not see how the original nine were selected, when one member leaves 9 Muses, the Star Empire execs go to an agency that show them binders full of women (seriously) for the company to pick one to add to the group. The shallow means necessary to become a K-pop star seem to be highlighted, as execs first and foremost need a girl who is similar age of the other girls and is tall with singing and dancing capabilities an afterthought.

The viewer heartbreakingly follows the likable singer as she enthusiastically tries to encourage her members to work hard, though her effort is met with crushing results when she is blamed for 9 Muses\u2019 lack of success and removed from the position. Moreover, while the doc highlights the glamorous life of shooting music videos and TV appearances, a dark side emerges in seeing the girls criticized for their makeup or when certain members get minimal TV show screen time. A critical moment of the doc comes when the group finally makes their TV debut and, despite a highly technical performance most Western girl groups could only dream of pulling off, 9 Muses\u2019 debut performance of \u201cNo Playboy\u201d is considered a disaster.   The second half of the doc comes after the \u201cNo Playboy\u201d debut when the mood is shifted with an unspoken (or unseen?) newfound focus on excruciatingly hard work. Now, rehearsals are absolutely mandatory even when the girls, bruised and bandaged from a car crash, continue their rigorous practice. A standout tragic moment comes when a sick member is crying in a backroom, telling another, \u201cI can\u2019t tell him that I\u2019m sick\u2026 they are the type of people who will give a painkiller and make me dance through tears.\u201d By the end of the documentary, it\u2019s clear 9 Muses\u2019 discipline changed the group as the girls rehearse in hallways a minute up until going on stage. But at what cost? The brilliant final scene ends with Sera singing a ballad in a rehearsal room. She tells the camera, \u201cThis could have been a beautiful documentary if it was up till our debut,\u201d agreeing that their lives became much more rigorous after their flaws were exposed on national TV. The doc leaves the viewer with an uncomfortable emotional stirring, wondering if these performers can truly be happy in the K-pop life, as Sera admits her stress is only relieved when she sings, despite a contradictory teardrop sliding down her face signaling otherwise. Despite a few typos on the translated captions, the documentary\u2019s message is clear: \u201c9 Muses of Star Empire\u201d is ultimately an examination of how humans treat each other \u2014 whether you\u2019re an artist or a CEO \u2014 while following dreams in the Korean entertainment biz. Directors: Hark-Joon LeeExecutive producer: Chung-Oh BangProducers: Suk-Kee Lee, Style Chosum and Min-Chul Kim, Mich & FilmsRunning time: 82 minutes North American Premiere: July 26 at Film Society of Lincoln Center, as part of its Sound + Vision series, at 4:30 p.m. There is another viewing on July 30 at 8:30 p.m. Get tickets here. Luckily, there is a happy ending for 9 Muses that the documentary doesn\u2019t show. The group is back together with nine members, which is beneficial for their namesake. As well, their latest single, \u201cWild,\u201d peaked at No. 18 on the K-Pop Hot 100 chart in May, continuing the group\u2019s upward chart climb.
