By Hannah Coates If you haven\u2019t yet heard of Dr Jart+, it\u2019s only a matter of time until you do. One of the best known Korean skincare brands \u2013 that has been instrumental in bringing some of the most enduring K-beauty trends over to the UK \u2013 it has recently re-launched here at Boots, to great relief from those who already swear by its products. The renaissance of the brand (which was founded in 2005 by ex-architect Chin Wook Lee and was later bought by Est\u00e9e Lauder in 2019) is accompanied by a seal of approval that all excellent formulas (think CeraVe and The Ordinary) enjoy: viral TikTok status. The brand\u2019s Cicapair Tiger Grass Colour Correcting Treatment has become a skincare sensation on the social media platform, which has a knack for propelling previously under-the-radar products to cult status. Combining soothing anti-inflammatory ingredients, like raspberry leaf extract and cica (otherwise known as centella asiatica or tiger grass), in a colour-changing cream, it neutralises redness and acts as a second-skin base. It is but one example of the brand\u2019s problem-solving, hybrid skincare products and, contrary to the traditional 12-step K-beauty skincare regime, makes stripping back the number of products one uses (also known as skinimalism) a breeze. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. By Alice Cary By Hannah Jackson By Hannah Coates The brand\u2019s product line-up comprises a few different \u201calbums\u201d, as they call it; to you and I, that\u2019s different ranges. The Tiger Grass Colour Correcting Treatment is a part of the bestselling Cicapair range, which harnesses the power of cica to relieve and repair sensitive skin caused by environmental factors such as pollution \u2013 the line includes everything from a serum to a calming gel cream. Then there is Ceramidin, which spotlights another ingredient du jour \u2013 ceramides \u2013 to help strengthen the skin barrier; the cream is a good first port of call. And finally, there is Vital Hydra, which is one for those with dehydrated skin thanks to five different types of hyaluronic acid in its formula. It is also formulated to look after our skin microbiome, more on which later. As a result of the Korean consumer\u2019s skincare know-how (they are fluent in \u201chome care\u201d which is the concept of taking your aesthetician\u2019s teachings and product recommendations home to carry on the treatment day to day) the products are all designed to tackle the problems that prevent one from having healthy, glowing skin. It is this that\u2019s behind its cult following: \u201cThe fundamental root of our business is about creating an exceptional and differentiated skincare solution,\u201d Lee tells Vogue. \u201cOur commitment to being skincare innovators drives us towards new cosmetic breakthroughs without the need to conform to traditional [brand] rules \u2013 which, in turn, allows us to create the most effective products for healthy skin, through using the most trusted and safest ingredients, coupled with our scientifically-backed delivery methods.\u201d It\u2019s no wonder that the brand saw double digital growth in 2020. By Hannah Coates Korean cosmetics brands are, he says, making rapid advances in technology, which allows for them to launch these hybrid products that help slash the amount of time spent doing one\u2019s beauty routine. And lest we forget, it\u2019s brands like Dr Jart+ that brought the concept of now staple products, like BB creams, to the West in the first place: \u201cIn 2004, I found a blemish balm that was used at the clinic for treatment purposes and I was amazed at this hybrid that combined two steps of a beauty routine \u2013 skincare and make-up,\u201d he says. \u201cI reinterpreted this blemish balm as BB cream and went full speed ahead in launching my brand \u2013\u00a0it is a bestseller to this day.\u201d So what can we expect to become the next big staple in our beauty regimes? Well, given the K-beauty market globally is expected to reach a huge $21.8 billion by 2026, when it comes to the science incorporated into each product to foster good skin health, it\u2019s only up from here. Lee, for one, has his game plan in check: \u201cThe microbiome is one of the areas Bill Gates chose as a key topic in global healthcare research and development,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the Korean market, it\u2019s a hot topic in various fields like cosmetics, household goods and food. Via our brand characteristics of pursuing dermatology-led skincare solutions, we\u2019re aiming to identify more technologies and ingredients that provide fundamental solutions to keep our skin healthy, and apply them effectively to products.\u201d The message? Prepare to learn even more about your skin microbiome.
