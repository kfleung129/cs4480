The retailer celebrated the opening of the Korean beauty brand pop-up stores with Hong Kong actress Charmaine Sheh and Korean movie star Park Eun Hye. They were joined by Hera head make-up artist Jinsu Lee in sharing their beauty tips with Hera fans and showing them how to achieve the signature K-beauty Seoulista look. According to DFS, the brand, known for its cutting-edge technology, is a favourite with trend-savvy women looking to emulate the K-beauty styles seen in K-pop music and K-drama TV shows. In order to help customers achieve the desired Seoulista look, the main pop-up store at T Galleria by DFS, Hong Kong, Canton Road will offer Seoulista makeup demonstrations by Hera\u2019s head makeup artist as well as a makeup touch-up service to customers. All four pop-up stores will offer a limited supply of product kits to customers with a minimum purchase. A DFS statement said: \u201cHera chose Hong Kong, the largest cosmetics market in Asia, for its first-ever pop-up stores, partnering with DFS to create a test-bed for the global market and a bridge to other Asian countries. Featuring best-selling fan-favourites, including the Olympia Le-Tan UV Mist Cushion, UV Mist Cushion and Age Reverse Cushion, the four Hong Kong pop-up shops bring local customers and international travellers first access to the Hera brand in Asia outside Korea.\u201d Tagged with: DFS Hong Kong ",
