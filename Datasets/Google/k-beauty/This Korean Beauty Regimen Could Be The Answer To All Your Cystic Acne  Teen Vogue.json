    "text": "By Sarah Wu It\u2019s patently untrue to suggest that any breakout is a welcome sight, but the deeply embedded blemishes known as\u00a0cystic acne cause a special kind of dread. If you\u2019ve encountered this skin condition before \u2014 particularly around a certain time of month \u2014 you already know what a complete pain these inflamed bumps can be to treat.\n\u00a0\nCue two of our favorite beauty sources to the rescue: K-beauty expert (and founder of Soko Glam) Charlotte Cho and the online goldmine of skincare secrets, Reddit. The duo came together when Charlotte discovered a\u00a0Reddit thread\u00a0on cult K-beauty brand\u00a0COSRX, which uses simple, natural ingredients to address the root of your acne issues. After thoroughly testing the line on her own skin, she decided to introduce it as the first acne-targeted collection curated through her site, a\u00a0major\u00a0stamp of approval that instantly got us curious.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter trying the products ourselves, we\u2019re here to tell you that this line is legit. It\u2019s packed with effective ingredients like snail secretion filtrate (good on dry patches, acne, and hyperpigmentation) and hyaluronic acid \u2014 so your complexion heals, but doesn\u2019t dry out. To get the scoop on using these products effectively, we turned to Charlotte for the seven-step, blemish busting tutorial. Here\u2019s the rundown:\n\u00a0\n1. Cleanse.\u00a0Ridding your skin of dirt and debris is one of the best ways to prevent breakouts in the first place. \u201cI use\u00a0the\u00a0COSRX Low pH Good Morning Cleanser\u00a0as the second part of my double cleanse,\u201d she says. The low pH of 5 won\u2019t strip your skin of its natural oils, but the inclusion of mild acids helps clear your complexion. The formula goes on as a clear gel and transforms into a foam as you work it in, meaning it removes makeup as well!\n\u00a0\n2. Tone.\u00a0Toning isn\u2019t always an essential step in your skincare routine, but a BHA toner like\u00a0COSRX Natural BHA Skin Returning A Sol\u00a0can make a huge difference on breakouts and rough spots alike. \u201cTap with fingers to absorb,\u201d instructs Charlotte. The key ingredient is a 60% concentration of black bee propolis, which helps inhibit bacterial growth while soothing and repairing skin. As for the BHA, that\u2019s paired with natural AHAs to control excess sebum and speed cellular turnover.\n\u00a0\n3. Exfoliate.\u00a0The next step is to penetrate deeper into your pores to completely clear away bacteria and debris. For this, Charlotte recommends the\u00a0[COSRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid](http://sokoglam.com/products/cosrx-aha-7-whitehead-power-liquid(, which harnesses more AHAs. \u201cIt\u2019s a powerful exfoliant,\u201d she notes. \u201cIt not only treats existing breakouts, but also prevents them from occurring.\u201d\n\u00a0\n4. Treat.\u00a0You can think of ampoules as the next step after a serum: similar formula, but a higher concentration of active ingredients geared toward skin in crisis mode. Dab0COSRX Centella Blemish Ampoule\u00a0on any breakouts \u2014 it\u2019s specifically formulated for sensitive, stressed-out skin. The base is made from\u00a0centella asiatica\u00a0leaf water, a medicinal herb that\u2019s used to treat wounds and small infections. As a bonus side effect, it also hydrates and promotes collagen production and elasticity, while reducing the appearance of pores (try applying a thin layer to your T-zone if you tend to get oily).\n\u00a0\n5. Hydrate.\u00a0It\u2019s important to keep skin moisturized, even when attempting to reduce breakouts. For a light layer of serious hydration, Charlotte likes the\u00a0COSRX Natural BHA Skin Returning Emulsion. It\u2019s ideal for keeping your skin clear because it mixes clarifying ingredients like AHAs and BHAs with hydrating additions like hyaluronic acid. The texture of an emulsion is that of a lightweight fluid, so those who shy away from thick, heavy moisturizers won\u2019t feel weighed down with product.\n\u00a0\n6. Heal.\u00a0Still with us? Here\u2019s our pick for the hero product of the line. You may be familiar with pimple patches, which have a pliable texture and adhere directly to your blemish. While they\u2019re usually only effective on surface acne, COSRX has somehow managed to make a version that helps treat cystic acne. \u201cThe\u00a0COSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch\u00a0treats acne for what it really is \u2014 an infected wound,\u201d says Charlotte, who refers to the product as an overnight miracle worker. \u201cIt even helps flatten and heal cystic acne faster,\u201d she adds. The thin, hydrocolloid patches work by breaking down debris and absorbing gunk from any type of breakout. Stick one on before you go to bed, and marvel in the morning.\n\u00a0\n7. Brighten.\u00a0So you\u2019ve successfully vanquished your blemishes, and now want to brighten any leftover hyperpigmentation. Your final step is the\u00a0COSRX Galactomyces Whitening Power Essence, which causes cellular turnover to move faster than its normal, 28-day cycle. The active ingredient is fermented yeast extract, which is the same star ingredient used in lines like Missha and SK-II. Charlottes parting tip for maintaining that clear complexion? \u201cBesides topically applying products, you can pay attention to what you eat,\u201d she advises. \u201cYou might want to test how dairy, coffee, or sugar affect your skin.\u201d Consider yourself fully armed to fight your next cystic acne breakout.
