And now, Avon\u2019s new collaboration with Korean brand The Face Shop makes it easier to shop these skincare and makeup must-haves than ever. We asked influencers Chloe Zhang and Vivienne Gliesche to put the products to the test, with seriously glowy results.  \u201cThe cushion products. I just love how they feel on the skin\u2014they\u2019re lightweight and moisturizing.\u201d \u201cIt takes me around 15 minutes to get ready every morning.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a little bit of both. Sometimes I like the matte or satin lipstick look, but sometimes I like to add a little gloss so my lips look extra full and moisturized.\u201d \u201cThe Foundation Cushion. It\u2019s extremely hydrating and the perfect shade for my skin tone, which is a lifesaver because I always find it hard to find a cushion that matches me. It\u2019s easy to apply and means I don\u2019t have to buy beauty blenders. I also find it\u2019s more of a natural look on skin compared to a lot of liquid foundations, which can be more heavy. And it gives your skin the perfect glowy, dewy look!\u201d  \u201cI love K-beauty products, especially skincare. Hydrated and glowing skin is the best base for any makeup. I always make sure my skin is nourished, which means that I can apply less foundation.\u201d \u201cTry a rich moisturizer, see how you like it and go from there. Too many different products all at once might be overwhelming and confuse your skin.\u201d \u201cOh, yes! Some might say it is the thing I am most passionate about. I love glowing, healthy-looking skin and will never go without highlighter when I do my makeup. I love placing it on my cheeks, browbone, inner corner of my eyes, and a tiny bit on the nose and forehead.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hard to choose, but the Oil Blending Cream for skincare and the Ink Serum Lip Tint for makeup. Both products are so hydrating and will make you glow!\u201d Share As someone who experienced adolescence in the early aughts, I'll be the first to admit that I love a celebrity-owned beauty line. In 2002, JLo launched Glow\u2014a skin-like fragrance housed in curvy frosted glass\u2014and I practically begged my mother to buy me a bottle. She eventually caved, and I was thrilled to own such a grown-up scent. Two years later, Britney Spears dropped Curious and you couldn't walk past a group of teenage girls without\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a dumpster fire\u201d is a sentiment echoed by thousands.
