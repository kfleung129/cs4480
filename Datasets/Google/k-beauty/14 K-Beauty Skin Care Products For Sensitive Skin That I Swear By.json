    "text": "(Beauty Report Card) It\u2019s gentle and leaves my face feeling fresh. I\u2019ve become more meticulous about my skin care routine as I age. Twelve-year-old me used to apply my mother\u2019s Pond\u2019s cream all over my face and call it a day, but now 29-year-old me uses products like rose toner, hydrating serums, and whipped argan oil face butter. (I\u2019m fancy, I know.) My collection of beauty go-tos has expanded significantly, especially when it comes to amassing K-beauty skin care products for sensitive skin. (I have extra dry skin, can\u2019t handle overly fragrant lotions or wipes, and I\u2019m prone to hormonal breakouts.) I\u2019ve found that K-beauty items, overall, are less likely to irritate my face and body compared to other non-Asian brands out there. You\u2019ll find cult-favorite labels from Seoul like Innisfree and Dr. Jart in my bathroom cabinet to new favs like Schwanen Garten. (I\u2019ll also never leave for a vacation without packing my trusty COSRX pimple patches.) Over the years, I assumed that K-beauty skin care formulations worked the best for me because, well, I\u2019m Asian, but I decided to dig a little deeper into why the products actually work. I spoke with Charlotte Cho \u2014 an esthetician, author, and founder of K-beauty brand Soko Glam \u2014 who clued me in. \u201cDue to the yellow dust phenomenon that occurs in Korea and can often irritate skin, Korean people identify with sensitive and dry skin, so many Korean beauty products are formulated to cater to those skin concerns,\u201d Cho shares. \u201cK-beauty provides great innovative and traditional ingredients that work to soothe, calm, and fortify \u2014 to make the skin stronger. Centella asiatica [an antioxidant-rich, medicinal herb], houttuynia cordata [a medicinal and edible herb], and lotus are all great examples of gentle yet fortifying ingredients. [Meanwhile] antioxidants, like ginseng and licorice, tackle inflammation, free radical damage, and dryness.\u201d She adds that this approach to skin care ingredients is a tad different than how the Western world views it. \u201cWestern skin care is [more] active centered. Actives are skin care ingredients like retinol, vitamin C, and acids that are a bit more intense and can cause some irritation,\u201d she says. Though many people use active products without any irritation, I, personally, haven\u2019t found the right concoction yet. I mainly stick to intensive, hydrating K-beauty treatments and anything labeled as \u201cgentle\u201d or \u201csensitive.\u201d For those on the opposite end of the dry spectrum \u2014 e.g. you have oily but sensitive skin \u2014 Cho emphasizes that there are plenty of K-beauty products to assist with those needs, as well. \u201cThis skin type requires more gentle, yet impactful, classic Korean skin care ingredients like green tea, licorice root extract, and snail mucin,\u201d she says. \u201cBuilding up and nourishing the skin barrier is key.\u201d If you have sensitive skin, perhaps it\u2019s time to incorporate a K-beauty product or two that\u2019s targeted to your needs. I\u2019ve included a few of my favorite gentle must haves, ahead, along with several of Cho\u2019s personal recommendations. Join me on the K-beauty train \u2014 I\u2019m never hopping off.
