In related news, the official music video for \u201cCrazy of You,\u201d at No. 2 this week, premiered on Sept. 3. The visual highlights emotional scenes from \u201cMaster\u2019s Sun.\u201d  Original Wonder Girl member Sunmi, who left the group in early 2010 to be replaced by current rapper/singer Lim, is now finding solo stardom with her first single, \u201c24 Hours.\u201d Despite missing out on over two years of overseas promotions with the Wonder Girls (including a proper U.S. single, \u201cLike Money,\u201d featuring Akon), Sunmi nets a big hit with a hard-hitting pop track enhanced with a tango-inspired section. The sexy music video has over a million views. Sunmi\u2019s high chart position is a good look for JYP Entertainment, who have only seen similarly successful results with their idol group 2AM on the singles tally. The \u201cqueen of OST,\u201d Baek Ji Young, makes a splash on the chart at No. 6 with \u201cIs Crying.\u201d The sorrow-filled ballad is the main soundtrack single to a popular Korean TV drama, \u201cGood Doctor.\u201d Baek Ji Young\u2019s vocal prowess tells a story of a broken-hearted woman who can\u2019t do anything but cry over her lost love.  Following the April release of \u201cLYn 8th #1,\u201d female vocalist Lyn (who had a four-week No. 1 with \u201cTo Turn Back the Hands of Time\u201d returns with the second part of the album, \u201cLYn 8th #2.\u201d Lead single \u201cI Like This Song,\u201d climbs to the No. 8 this week. Produced by Duble Sidekick (SISTAR, B.A.P, T-ara N4), the pop track is a melodic number built on acoustic guitar riffs and piano lines where Lyn expresses her feelings to a new crush. Another track off the release, \u201cSong For Love,\u201d is a R&B-influenced pop track which lands at No. 75 this week. Rising girl group SPICA makes a suprising chart move with their new single, \u201cTonight.\u201d Despite barely even cracking the K-Pop Hot 100 Top 40 since their 2012 debut, their latest rockets to the No. 9 slot for a massive debut. The success may be chalked up to the quintet having K-pop veteran diva Lee Hyori \u2014 who netted her own No. 1 single this year \u2014 acting as producer and style consultant for the girls\u2019 new single. Lee brought the group an up-tempo, accessible pop track that also showed off their powerhouse vocals, plus a flirty style that looks torn out of the summer catalog at Urban Outfitters. Watch the girls get their hipster on below: In other chart news, popular boy band TEEN TOP earns another Top 10 entry with their new single, \u201cRocking.\u201d Notably, the track was premiered live at KCON 2013 in Los Angeles last month.
