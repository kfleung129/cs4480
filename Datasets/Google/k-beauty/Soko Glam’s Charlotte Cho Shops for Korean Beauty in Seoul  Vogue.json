By Zoe Ruffner \u201cI calculated, and for 2016, I spent a third of the year in Korea,\u201d says New York\u2013based Soko Glam cofounder Charlotte Cho, who travels to Seoul upwards of eight times a year to source the latest and greatest of K-beauty for her online shop. And yet, despite her frequent flyer status, Cho admits that she has a hard time keeping up with the market: \u201cKorean products are changing so quickly. There\u2019s always something new on the shelves!\u201d For her most recent trip in June, this was no exception. For seven days, Cho traversed the bustling city seeking out unique finds to bring back with her from the likes of concept shop 3CE\u2014complete with a beauty counter, hair salon, and movie theater\u2014and Jakeunchai where she underwent a K-pop makeover. \u201cThe emphasis is on a heart-shaped face with a pointy chin,\u201d Cho explains of the favored look. \u201cThey\u2019re really about contouring as well, but in a more subtle way [than Americans]. It\u2019s not like Kim Kardashian.\u201d But don\u2019t be fooled by the plethora of clever cushion compacts and panda-patterned under-eye masks on offer. \u201cWhen people think of K-beauty they think, \u2018Oh, products!\u2019, but there\u2019s so much more to Seoul than makeup and skincare\u201d insists Cho, who squeezed in an aromatherapy tea tasting and acupuncture session, too. Here, from a custom lipstick\u2013making experience to a traditional ginseng foot scrub, a look at Cho\u2019s whirlwind of a week in Seoul, South Korea.
