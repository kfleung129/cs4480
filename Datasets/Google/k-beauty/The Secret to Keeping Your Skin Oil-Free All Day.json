From how to get rid of dark circles, to how to deal with the effects of hard water, to the secret to oil control on your skin \u2014 you've got questions and Cosmopolitan.com's beauty editor Carly Cardellino has answers.  Q: \"My dark circles can be covered with concealer, but the actual shadows never disappear. What can I do non-surgically?\" \u2014 @kayleeslaterIf you inherit fair or thin skin under your eyes, it's more obvious when blood pools there (often because of slower circulation from lack of sleep). This accumulation causes fragile capillaries to stretch and leak. A: Chances are your dark circles are part of your genetic makeup, since they're always visible. So, aside from camouflaging them with concealer (if yours are reading red, choose a concealer that is green to cancel them out, and if they're a darker brown, opt for an orange cover-up to diminish the look of them), there are a few things you can do to minimize their appearance. Neal Schultz, M.D., a cosmetic dermatologist in NYC, suggests getting seven (or more) hours of sleep each night, and then using a peptide-infused, collagen production-building product daily. One of Schultz's mainstays complete with peptides: Beauty Rx Skincare by Dr. Schultz Gentle Exfoliating Eye Therapy Cream, $50, beautyrx.com. He also recommends patting on an under-eye concealer with light reflecting particles that will distract from any darkness \u2014 try: Yves Saint Laurent Touche \u00c9clat Radiant Touch, $40, sephora.com \u2014 and wearing sunglasses, \"since when you squint in the sunlight it creates folds underneath your eyes and each fold of skin casts a shadow on your under-eye area, making your dark cirlces appear worse.\" Q: \"Is there a good hard-water shampoo/conditioner on a Pantene budget? #buildup #tangles\"  \u2014 @TheMonalysia A: Yes, there are actually a bunch of inexpensive options that can help with your hard water issue. Basically, what's happening to your hair is that the minerals, like iron, in the hard water are affecting it, leaving it too-soft and unmanageable, says , a celebrity stylist at the Serge Normant Salon in NYC. \"Plus, hard water has a tough time rinsing shampoo and other styling products out of your hair entirely, so often times you're left with a greasy film that's a build up of detergent that makes your hair feel dirty and oily and look weighed down.\" Tommy Buckett But don't worry, there is a light at the end of this tress tunnel. Buckett recommends using a detoxifying shampoo once a week to remove mineral and product build up; that way your hair looks healthy clean with a side of volume. One Buckett likes is: Garnier Fructis Pure Clean 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner \u2014 it contains zero silicones, parabens and dyes, leaves your hair super clean and full of body, and it's affordable! Q: \"What is the best oil control makeup or secret? An hour after mine goes on I need a blotter sheet..help!\" \u2014 @bananana713 A: The secret to controling the oil on your face, so that your makeup doesn't slide off midday comes down to these four things:  washing your face with an  in the shower \u2014 that way you're already decreasing the amount of oil on your skin from the start.
