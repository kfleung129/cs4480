    "text": "If you haven\u2019t heard of K-Pop or K-Beauty, then you\u2019re probably living under a rock. Jokes aside, the hype surrounding Korean skincare is not new and it isn\u2019t dying anytime soon. If you have heard of terms like \u2018glass skin\u2019, \u2018mirror skin\u2019 or the famous \u201910 step Korean skincare\u2019, then you have unknowingly become a part of the Korean juggernaut. Korean beauty products are more popular than ever in India, with more and more Korean brands launching here. India\u2019s haircare and skincare markets were estimated to be worth a whopping Rs 38,339 crore in 2020 as per Euromonitor. As per a survey conducted by \u2018Rakuten Insight\u2019 and published by Statista, about 39% of Indian women respondents stated that their skincare routines consisted uber 25% of K-Beauty products. About 3% of women surveyed said that their entire skincare routine consisted of K-Beauty products. If that\u2019s not indicative of the growing prevalence of K-Beauty products, then we don\u2019t know what is. The lockdowns and the pandemic shifted the focus from makeup to skincare and that is a big shift in the beauty industry. Korean skincare products appeal to Indians because they use traditional and natural ingredients, and that is also a major trend this year. So if you are a beauty enthusiast, here are the Korean skincare\u00a0 trends and products that will be everywhere this year. Table of Contents Image Credit- iStock Korean skincare uses a lot of traditional herbal ingredients and they are also called \u2018Hanbang\u2019 ingredients. Some of the popular ingredients are ginseng, green tea, licorice, lotus root etc. These ingredients cater to a variety of concerns when added in a product.

It\u2019s always a great practice to check with a dermatologist while layering different AHAs and BHAs, as acids work on removing dead skin and can irritate the skin if not used properly. Balance is key while layering actives for best results. Image Credit- iStock As people are becoming more conscious about what they apply to their skin, companies are sitting up and taking notes. This is leading to more plant based, vegan and chemical free products.

A very successful example of hybrid skincare is the BB or CC cream. This also works very well when two or more popular ingredients are offered in the same product. As people look for options that are more effective, we will see more multi-use products. Image Credit- iStock Retinol is a product that skincare geeks swear by and why not? It's one of the most effective skincare ingredients in the market. This hero ingredient works like magic, as it prevents wrinkles, brightens skin and minimises breakouts. But like all good things, this ingredient also needs to be used in moderation. Korean products are now using retinol but in lesser potencies as it decreases the risk of overwhelming the skin without changing the results.
