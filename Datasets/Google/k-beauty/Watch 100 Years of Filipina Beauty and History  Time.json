    "text": "The folks over at Cut Video have released the sixth episode of 100 Years of Beauty, taking us not just through a century of beauty in the Philippines, but of Filipino history too. The video begins with the Spanish-American War at the turn of the century, when indigenous women were adorned with tribal tattoos and shell headpieces. After U.S. took control of the country, American trends began to heavily influence Filipino beauty. By the 1920s and \u201930s, women were inspired by jazz and the silver screen \u2014 glamorous updos with heavy makeup became in vogue until Japanese occupation began during World War II. After the war, the Philippine\u2019s film industry boomed and mestiza (half-Filipino half-Caucasian) actresses set the trend for red lips and rosy cheeks. America kept influencing beauty trends throughout the \u201960s, with big bouffant hair inspired by Jackie O and Imelda Marcos, the wife of Filipino dictator Ferdinand Marcos, moving to the hippie style of the \u201970s. By the 2000s people turned to Korean music and television for style and beauty trends and long straight hair became popular. As the video fast-forwards to present day, K-pop and American culture still dominate women\u2019s styles with full wavy hair and dark brows. Write to Helen Regan at helen.regan@timeasia.com. ",
