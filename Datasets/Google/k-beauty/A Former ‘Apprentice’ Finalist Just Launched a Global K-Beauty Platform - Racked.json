When he auditioned, he asked the producers why there had never been an Asian male on the show before. He says they essentially told him, \u201cNo offense, but Asian males don\u2019t make for good television.\u201d Sun proved them wrong, making it to the finals, where he ultimately was \u201cfired.\u201d He went on to become a serial tech entrepreneur, his most recent company being K-beauty site W2Beauty (more on that shortly). He founded companies like Pirq, an app that functions as a digital loyalty program, which he later sold. He also founded Dramabeans, a popular English-language site that dissects Korean dramas and K-pop with 14 million users. He made headlines during the presidential campaign in 2016 when he went on CNN with a few other former Apprentice contestants to denounce Trump\u2019s message. Trump responded by calling them all \u201cfailing wannabes.\u201d Sun says he declined to respond. For the last three years, Sun, who is Korean American, says he has given probably 200 speeches on diversity and globalization. \u201cI\u2019ve realized why people are not receptive of [certain] cultures... It really comes down to exposure and education,\u201d he says on a Skype call from Seoul. \u201cDramabeans made me proud to see all these non-Koreans appreciate and love Korean culture and food and music. I realized through business there is a way I can help fight prejudice and bias and increase the exposure of diversity in our world.\u201d When asked about his interactions with Trump and whether or not he had any conversations with him about the experience of being Asian in America, Sun says, \u201cI had several conversations with him about it. I would say that Trump overall respects the Asian culture; he understands that there are complexities in it, but he has some stereotypes as well.\u201d Like what? \u201cI remember one episode, there were some problems with the computer system and he\u2019s like, \u2018Hey James, uh, aren\u2019t you really good at that kind of stuff?\u2019 And I go, \u2018Why would I be good at that kind of stuff?\u2019 You know, moments like that.\u201d Sun has moved on and is now attempting to spread the message of another Korean cultural moment, K-beauty. He says he was interested in buying a site, and purchased W2Beauty, a small blog in Korea that sold a few products. He relaunched it in March with 7,500 products and global shipping capacity. The company, which is registered in the US, has raised seed funding, and Sun hopes to raise \u201ca couple million dollars\u201d more in the next few months in series A funding. The company has offices in Seoul and LA, and has 11 full time employees. Like what you\u2019re reading? W2Beauty has three arms through which it hopes to engage people: sales of products, editorial, and a community platform. It\u2019s hard not to compare it to Memebox, a site that also used to offer thousands of products, but has since pivoted to content and producing private-label products, one of which is doing well at Ulta. Sun says the differentiator is that W2Beauty will ship all its products from Korea (which is how Memebox started), rather than having a warehouse in the US. He claims that even though shipping times to some countries can take up to three weeks, products are \u201cfresher.\u201d He also speculates that one of the reasons Memebox didn\u2019t succeed as a retailer was because the brands it worked with felt threatened because of the competing products Memebox was launching. But Sun is thankful for the pioneering work Memebox did in creating awareness and a market here in the US \u2014 he calls it \u201cK-beauty 1.0.\u201d Currently, about 60 percent of W2Beauty\u2019s traffic comes from the US and Canada, and the majority of the rest from Southeast Asia and Mexico/Latin America. Sun says the Middle East may prove to be an exciting market; he claims some customers there have purchased between $2,000 and $3,000 worth of merchandise at one time. You can find all the popular K-beauty brands on the site, like Etude House, Missha, Skinfood, Su:m37, and Banila Co, as well as lesser-known brands like Romand and Pudding Hair. Each product includes a description, full ingredient list, and \u201cinsights,\u201d though not every single product is updated yet; Sun says they will be soon. Shipping is free when you spend $60. Editorial is the second arm of W2Beauty\u2019s business. As K-beauty entrepreneurs have discovered, education about products is key since many of them feature formulations and names US shoppers have never seen. Sun estimates that only five to seven out of a hundred American women really know what K-beauty is. He hired Anna Park, the former editor in chief of Audrey magazine, the first Asian-American-focused fashion magazine. (It published from 2003 until 2015, when it shuttered.) She is in charge of editorial content on the site and oversees a stable of 10 writers, many of whom, like Jude Chao and Coco Park, have successful K-beauty blogs. This isn\u2019t a new concept in the K-beauty commerce space. Charlotte Cho, the founder of Soko Glam, launched a freestanding content site called the Klog, where her writers talk about K-beauty, products, Korean culture, and general beauty topics. Whenever a site that sells stuff provides education, there\u2019s always the question of how objective they can really be. Sun says, \u201cMy first priority is that we have the best content that\u2019s trusted and authentic. We write about trends and products and ideas,\u201d as opposed to straight-up product reviews, though those are definitely there. This one recommends a Romand cushion, a brand that Sun brought up a few times in the conversation as one he\u2019s excited about. It\u2019s a tricky proposition, though it\u2019s true that potential customers really don\u2019t understand K-beauty fully yet. \u201cI tell my investors, \u2018if you\u2019re expecting us to just get sales sales sales, this is the wrong company. If you\u2019re in it for the long term to build the first and best K-beauty community in the world, then you can be an investor.\u201d The bloggers Sun hired have a lot of credibility in the K-beauty community, but it will be interesting to see how they balance their independent blogs with working for a retailer. Community is the last arm. A platform just soft-launched last week and is still in beta, though W2Beauty will officially announce it at KCON on August 19th. Every member has her or his own wall, and there is also a scrolling feed. You can comment on products, editorial posts, and people\u2019s walls. There is no private messaging capability currently. Reddit already has some robust forums for discussing K-beauty, like the Asian Beauty subreddit, but Sun says, \u201cI think Reddit\u2019s great for the hardcore fans of K-beauty who are almost like debating each other. There\u2019s a place for that. The goal of the community is not to replace Reddit but to grow the market.\u201d He hopes that people with similar skin types and concerns will find each other and discuss products that work. He also says that this is where potential negative product reviews will live, written by community members, as opposed to his editors writing them in the editorial section. K-beauty fans will likely be excited to have a new retail option, but it will have to survive some of the forces that felled Memebox and that currently challenge other K-beauty brands and retailers in the US. Sun is optimistic. \u201cNothing grows unless you do a version 2.0. We are defining ourselves as a K-beauty 2.0, which is not only about the next product we\u2019re trying to sell, but to really be about engaging users to have the conversation so it can grow as a market.\u201d ",
