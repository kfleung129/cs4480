    "text": "By Sarah Kinonen ICYMI: Unicorn beauty is living its best life right now. There are multicolor makeup brushes, glitter snot, and primer tears. And now, Erborian Glow Cr\u00e8me, a Korean beauty launch, is throwing its hat into the metaphorical magical unicorn ring. So get ready, because this K-beauty cream is both luxe and illuminating, and 100 percent worthy of space in your makeup bag. If you're not familiar with skin-care brand Erborian, here's a quick backstory: Founded by two women\u2014Hojung Lee, a Korean cosmetic scientist, and French beauty guru Katalin Berenyi\u2014Erborian is basically a hybrid of all things chic and French and innovative and Korean. It also happens to be the one brand that makes my all-time favorite BB cream on the market (my shade is Clair, FYI). It's lightweight and breathable, and keeps my underlying redness under wraps way past the time I leave the office for the night. But back to the Erborian Glow Cr\u00e8me. The brand's newest launch is pretty exciting in itself because it's the first multitasking and illuminating product in the lineup. According to the brand, the Glow Cr\u00e8me has three different purposes: It can be used as a primer, a highlighter, and an illuminator. (To be clear, a highlighter is usually used in a more targeted application on specific zones of the face; an illuminator is meant to be smoothed all over.) And while all three of those are good enough for me, when testing, I actually used the cream as, well, a cream. I found the iridescent milky formula to be hydrating enough to drench my entire face with moisture\u2014thanks to hydrating squalane and inflammatory licorice root\u2014before applying my daily single layer of BB cream. Usually, I tend to shy away from moisturizers with shimmery because I'm more of a matte kinda girl, but because this one is so subtle in sparkle, I wasn't at all offended by its barely-there strobe effect. And as for that glow? The silky quencher leaves behind a subtle dewy sheen that sparkles just so when it hits the light, but doesn't make me look like Koko Kardashian when she's trying a new lewk. (All the love, girl.) Meaning, one coat is tame enough for the office, while two might be better suited for happy hour. Either way, #totalunicornvibes.
