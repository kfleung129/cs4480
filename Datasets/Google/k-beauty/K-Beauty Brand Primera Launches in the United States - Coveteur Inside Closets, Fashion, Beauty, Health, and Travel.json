    "text": "When it comes to innovative skin care, South Korea is the motherland. We spotted our fair share of new beauty trends in Seoul when we visited last fall, but one brand in particular stood out from the many available options: Primera. It\u2019s never been available in the U.S. until today, with its exclusive launch on Sephora.com. Not only is it among the top cult-favorite skin-care lines in Seoul, but it is also a leader in the clean beauty industry and has been since 1999.With a focus on environmentally friendly ingredients\u2014not to mention responsible and recyclable packaging, from soy ink to glass bottles\u2014Primera is finally bringing its prestige line to the States. There are 24 available products, ranging from a moisturizing water cream to a facial peeling gel, and everything retails for under $74. The name comes from the brand\u2019s use of germination technology, i.e., their formulas utilize seeds that have just recently sprouted, which makes the product itself (whether it\u2019s hydrating, clarifying, etc.) more potent.If you\u2019re in the market for glowing skin (and really, who isn\u2019t?), we recommend starting with the Miracle Seed Essence. It\u2019s packed with amino acids and antioxidants from lotus seeds to smooth and plump your skin, meaning you\u2019ll walk away from your daily beauty routine with an even-toned, hydrated, and supple complexion. Just douse the accompanying unbleached cotton pads and swipe over your face before applying your favorite moisturizer. Enjoy deeply hydrated skin, and relish the fact that you\u2019re already halfway to becoming a K-beauty expert.Primera products are available today, June 25, on sephora.com and will be available at Sephora stores in July.\u00a0Photo: Courtesy of Primera\u00a0Want more stories like this?I Can\u2019t Stop Thinking About These New Beauty Trends I Saw in KoreaThe 411 on Skin-Care\u2019s Five Most Popular IngredientsThe Korean Beauty Trick for Long-Lasting Makeup  ",
