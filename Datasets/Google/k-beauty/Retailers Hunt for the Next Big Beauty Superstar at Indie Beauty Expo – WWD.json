Beauty Editor, West Coast The indie beauty explosion isn\u2019t fading anytime soon. Buyers from Ulta Beauty, HSN, Sephora, Costco, Amazon, Urban Outfitters Inc. and Peninsula Beauty, whose chief beauty officer Lori Silverstein revealed during a panel she\u2019s culling products from major conglomerates to make way for smaller players on the California specialty chain\u2019s shelves, wouldn\u2019t have descended upon the second edition of Indie Beauty Expo in Los Angeles if there wasn\u2019t supercharged consumer demand for cosmetics upstarts. Along with more than 1,000 attendees, they were among the nearly 310 buyers scouring 102 budding brands at the trade show trying to decipher which ones might become the next GlamGlow, Anastasia Beverly Hills or It Cosmetics.  \u201cThey all want to find the next hot indie brand,\u201d proclaimed Nader Naeymi-Rad, cofounder of IBE, speaking to WWD last month from the expo\u2019s penthouse venue at the California Market Center. \u201cIndie brands hold about 5 percent of the market, but they\u2019re growing at 20 percent, and the overall market is growing at 2 to 3 percent. So, they\u2019re capturing the growth dollars. I was talking to a large online retailer with more than\u00a0$100 million in turnover that was here, and he told me that roughly 40 percent of their online traffic\u00a0is now coming from new brands. He said our page with new brands is where the bulk of our traffic is going because that\u2019s what people want.\u201d Related Articles\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tBeauty Features\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\tBobbi Brown on Three Years of Jones Road\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tFashion Scoops\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\tMellerio Unveils First Perfume Indie brands have captured the imaginations of Millennial beauty shoppers. Whether due to their digital prowess, healthy positioning or passionate founders, they\u2019re pushing across mass and prestige beauty segments to reach those shoppers. Color cosmetics are clearly at the forefront of the indie beauty movement, but the fragrance and skin-care categories are certainly on board, too. At IBE, products from all categories were on display and even some unusual categories jumping into beauty, such as oral care, were present. A favorite exhibitor of IBE cofounder Jillian Wright\u2019s was Lebon, a toothpaste specialist selling fresh mint, cinnamon-mint and licorice-mint options for $16 without synthetic fragrances, parabens, triclosan, fluorine, colorings or saccharin. The French brand has broken into around 20 retail doors in the U.S., including New London Pharmacy, beautyhabit.com and luckyscent.com. \u201cThe scent is like opening up a bottle of perfume,\u201d swooned Wright. \u201cIt\u2019s just the most gorgeous toothpaste and, if you see their Instagram, it\u2019s really beautiful and it evokes emotion.\u201d Korean brands seem to be conquering beauty aisles everywhere these days, and they were a force at IBE as well. Cle Cosmetics punched up lip products with its vibrant Melting Lip Powder for $20 that transforms from a powder to a lasting tint with a matte finish. It comes in five colors, and the bestseller is Barbie Pink. Speaking of Cle, Sarah Chung, chief executive officer of Landing International, a marketplace connecting retailers with emerging beauty brands, said, \u201cThey are one of the first K-beauty brands developed for the U.S. market.\u201d She added that Cle Cosmetics has a wider shade variety than most Korean beauty brands. Its\u00a0$49 Essence Air Cushion foundation is available in four tones, and its $31 CCC Cream, a combination of BB and CC creams, is in five: light, medium light, medium, medium deep and deep.  Natural beauty sales\u00a0are on the rise, and the indie field offering them is increasingly crowded. But there remain niches within the natural beauty sector that have unrealized potential, according to brands and buyers. Fragrance is a key example. \u201cFor the longest time there was nothing [in natural perfume]. I hope to see more,\u201d said Romain Gaillard, founder and ceo of Detox Market. The clean-beauty retail and e-commerce concept carries the scent brands Honor\u00e9 des Pr\u00e9s, Strange Invisible Perfumes and Lurk. Los Feliz Botanicals, a fragrance line inspired by California landscapes containing $8 eau de parfums and $24 perfume balms, and Thorn & Bloom, an immaculately packaged brand with nine eau de parfums priced at $12, were standout IBE scent brands. Although not at the L.A. version of IBE, Thorn & Bloom\u2019s Bird of Paradise eau de parfum, which has notes of jasmine sambac and pink champaca at its heart, was feted with a best in show award for fragrance. Gaillard also believes ingestibles like vitamins, supplements and beverages formulated to improve the appearance of hair, skin and nails are finally taking off. \u201cI remember this discussion [about ingestibles] in the late Nineties where people were like, \u2018Oh yeah, it\u2019s the next big thing.\u2019 When we launched The Detox Market [in 2010], we were advocating them as part of our holistic approach, but people didn\u2019t care about them, even in Venice,\u201d he said, continuing ingestible brands are now resonating with customers, specifically Moon Juice with its collection of dust herbal supplements. Notable brands bringing the message of inside-out beauty to IBE were The Beauty Chef and Hum Nutrition. While the ingestible category is very nascent within natural beauty and beauty generally in the U.S., natural color cosmetics is a maturing category with established brands that have evolved to better respond to consumers. Au Naturale, for instance, is upgrading its packaging and has expanded its shade range. In March, it\u2019s moving to matte charcoal componentry that feels weightier than its previous componentry. On the shade range front, it\u2019s boosted\u00a0the number of foundation shades to 13 from eight at its founding six years ago. \u201cAfrican-Americans are really underserved in green beauty,\u201d explained Au Naturale founder Ashley Prange. Prange\u2019s distribution strategy for her brand is to go after Jane Iredale in spas, salons and hotels \u2014\u00a0and she\u2019s finding a receptive audience. She said, \u201cPeople who I never thought would be interested in learning about indie brands are listening to us.\u201d  Sign up for beauty news straight to your inbox every day Top News Stories Alerts Straight to your Inbox.
