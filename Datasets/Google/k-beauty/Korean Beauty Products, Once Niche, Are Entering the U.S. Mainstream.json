Never mind that she is constantly experimenting with the latest array of creams or serums as president of the Elizabeth Arden brand, even Wong\u2019s daily routine trumps this group of women known for their devotion to multi-step skin care rituals where it\u2019s not unusual to rely on up to a dozen different products. \"It really is the performance and efficacy of the products that really catapulted Korean beauty to become mainstream here.\u201d To accomplish a flawless complexion, Wong describes an extensive routine: In the morning she cleanses her skin, applies toner, dabs on an essence, layers five different serums, lathers on three moisturizers, and safeguards her skin with SPF. She not only repeats the cleansing process before going to bed, but she also covers herself with three moisturizers. Over the past year, Korean beauty products \u2014 from toners to sheet masks \u2014 have grown in prominence at U.S. stores. While beauty bloggers have raved about the skin care options from Korea for some time, more mainstream companies like Sephora and L\u2019Oreal have now taken notice. \u201cWhen we looked at the beauty space, we knew it was missing a category,\u201d Wong told NBC News. She added that Elizabeth Arden looked at global beauty trends when it launched its SUPERSTART Skin Renewal Booster. \u201cThis fills a gap in the beauty regimen,\" she said. https://www.instagram.com/p/BAH6VJcqAxB Brands looking to Korea see it as potential boon for their business. South Korea exported $1.8 billion in cosmetics in 2014 compared to the $1.04 billion it imported, according to the Korean Pharmaceutical Traders Association. In 2015, Sephora launched a campaign around its K-beauty products while Est\u00e9e Lauder\u2019s Clinique brand introduced a lotion with rice bran extract and pomegranate to the North American market that it said was inspired by the trend. Even Urban Outfitters carries a range of fun, whimsically-designed Korean beauty offerings in its stores. The BB cream craze \u2014 creams that claim to moisturize and even out skin tone, replacing a multitude of other products \u2014 hit the U.S. in 2011 when Sephora started carrying Dr. Jart+, a Korean brand. April Walloga, a beauty editor and the co-founder of Revelist, a millennial women\u2019s website slated to launch in early 2016, credits beauty bloggers and vloggers like Michelle Phan and Charlotte Cho for bringing more awareness to these products. She adds that millennial women pour through blogs, online forums, and social media for recommendations. https://www.instagram.com/p/853wVKuGUb \u201cEveryone was taking \u2018sheet mask selfies\u2019 and posting them on social media when they first got popular. They made you look like Jason from \u2018Friday the 13th,\u2019\u201d Walloga told NBC News. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have fun with beauty.\u201d The products aren\u2019t just about packaging, though. Dr. Dendy Engelman, director of dermatologic surgery at Metropolitan Hospital in Manhattan, told NBC News she's found many of the products to be on the cutting edge. \u201cThey are not about one size fits all. The products target one specific issue, and I think we\u2019re seeing a change about each step for each end goal,\u201d Engelman said. \u201cNow we need something for acne, eyes, the neck, etc. This all involves more steps.\u201d https://www.instagram.com/p/BAIgAoMLsfR Angela Kim, the founder and CEO of Insider Beauty, a Korean-focused online cosmetics retailer, says Americans are more curious about K-beauty than ever. \u201cThe packaging, branding, and fresh concepts are what really captured a lot of attention here,\u201d Kim, who also helps curate and test the items sold on Insider Beauty, told NBC News. \u201cBut it really is the performance and efficacy of the products that really catapulted Korean beauty to become mainstream here.\u201d Engelman believes that the popularity of Korean beauty product is beneficial to consumers. \u201cWe have more beautiful products than before. I think because that\u2019s thanks to the Asian market and how obsessed they are with skincare,\u201d she said. Yun Yu, a young publicist living in New York City, says she can relate to this obsession. Upon arriving to Korea on a visit, one of the first things she told NBC News she did was drag a friend to take her shopping to explore the many products not seen in the U.S. \u201cThe greatest contribution about this Korean fad, it has allowed for people to be more educated about skin care,\u201d Yu, who\u2019s devoted to a skin care routine that involves everything from cleansing oils to enzyme peels, said. \u201cI see a lot of my non-Asian friends starting to adapt the attitude of prevention versus damage control.\u201d But staying on trend when it comes to skincare also comes with a hefty price tag: Sephora's bestselling K-beauty products can cost up to $150 each. One Dr. Jart+ sheet mask is priced at $7.50 at Sephora, putting a twice-a-day routine at more than $100 a week for the masks alone. Wong, who says early prevention is a mantra at Elizabeth Arden, says American women looking to simplify their beauty routine could change their minds once they see the results that K-beauty products have on their skin. \u201cIf they see a benefit in an eight-step process, I truly believe they will step up to it,\u201d Wong said. \u201cA little bit can go a long way.\u201d Follow NBC Asian America on Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr. \u00a9\u00a02023 NBC UNIVERSAL ",
