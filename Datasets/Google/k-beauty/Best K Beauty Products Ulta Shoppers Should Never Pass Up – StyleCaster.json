You\u2019ll be hard-pressed to meet someone who hasn\u2019t at least walked through an Ulta or perused the store\u2019s website. Its shelves (both brick-and-mortar and digital) are that perfect mix of drugstore and designer brands, with more sales than we can keep up with. And then there are the unfairly overlooked brands, most of which are also some of the best K-beauty products Ulta has to offer. We need to do better people! In all seriousness, a Korean Beauty lineup will have your skin looking like a Glossier ad and completely elevate your knowledge of unconventional, but totally effective ingredients like snail mucin and donkey milk. My favorite part of shopping exclusively K-beauty is knowing that I\u2019ll probably save a lot of money because rarely is there a moisturizer or face mask that costs more than a cheap lunch.
