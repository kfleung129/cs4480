Now, fast-forward five years, Glow Recipe sells 30 different brands and private-label products, and it\u2019s preparing for international expansion. \u201cI think a lot of brands are discovering Glow Recipe\u2019s skin care, and they don\u2019t realize that we\u2019re K-beauty-inspired or a K-beauty brand,\u201d said Chang. \u201cThey just discover us as a fun skin-care brand that they see on social, or they hear about us through Sephora. Because of that approach, I think we\u2019ve grown to a place where we\u2019re reaching a very diverse customer base. K-beauty, for us, is always something that will be a part of our approach \u2014 in that it\u2019s a holistic, enjoyable approach to skin care \u2014 but we\u2019ve expanded past being defined as a K-beauty brand.\u201d On this week\u2019s episode of The Glossy Beauty Podcast, beauty editor Priya Rao sits down with Sarah Lee and Christine Chang, the co-founders and co-CEOs of Glow Recipe, to discuss how they\u2019re creating their own products, planning for expansion into Germany and beyond, and getting creative in the name of standout influencer activations. Edited highlights below. Creating products that multitask to appeal to the U.S. customer\nChang: \u201cWe were seeing so much innovation and technology when we went back to Korea, which was about seven times a year. Every time, we were so blown away by the newness coming into the market: these really beautiful, natural formulations with really unique packaging, textures or sensoriality. We felt there was [an opportunity] to bring these innovations over and translate them for the U.S. woman. K-beauty as a whole has been perceived to be really overwhelming. When we go to Sephora stores, the cast members there were telling us, \u2018K-beauty is amazing and I love the whole experience, but I can\u2019t tell my clients to use these 15 or 20 steps when I\u2019m not doing it myself.\u2019 In a way, that\u2019s a myth that\u2019s perpetuated by marketing claims. Women in Korea are not counting the amount of steps they\u2019re using; it\u2019s more about a dialogue with the skin. We knew there were a lot of hard-hitting, hybrid, multitasking formulas that delivered more, with just one product, and we felt that that could really speak to a U.S. woman. They want products that are results-driven and practical, but still sensorial and enjoyable.\u201d Approaching new markets in Europe and beyond\nLee: \u201cI would say that the German customer is similar to the U.S. customer. We\u2019re hearing that indie brands are on fire all throughout Europe and that there is a huge, growing interest in skin care as a category. So the trends are a couple of years behind. Maybe it\u2019s like the U.S., where makeup was really, really hot and now skin care is replacing that. We\u2019re seeing the same in Europe. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a huge difference in terms of how we would market the launch or the products that we\u2019re marketing. It\u2019s more about customizing it to the clients and really speaking to that market specifically. The product, the sensoriality, the visual aspect \u2014 all of that will be reused. Whatever we\u2019re doing on Instagram, the world is watching, so we\u2019re not going to change the wheel. It\u2019s going to be the same type of communication and partnering really closely with the retailer in that specific market, and honing in with their marketing tools.\u201d Creating standout influencer activation experiences\nChang: \u201cOur Avocado Melt Sleeping Mask comes from this formula we created because our customers were asking us for a more nourishing, comforting formula for very dehydrated skin. The texture of the product is comforting \u2014 we call it an \u2018avocuddle\u2019 for the face. We wanted to bring these attributes to our influencer activation, and our PR director, Steven Chong, came up with this idea that we\u2019d take over a mattress store in LA. So we created this green mattress store experience with lighting, sheets and avocado cushions, and everyone came in pajamas, lounged around, tried the mask and literally avocuddled with us. I really don\u2019t think there\u2019s a recipe to what\u2019s right or what\u2019s not for an influencer activation. I think the major advantage of being a nimble, startup environment is that we\u2019re able to test things very quickly, and if it\u2019s not the right fit, then we pivot and find something else.\u201d Get news and analysis about fashion, beauty and culture delivered to your inbox every morning.
