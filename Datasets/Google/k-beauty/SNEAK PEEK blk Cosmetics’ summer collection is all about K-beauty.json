Photo by Martin San Diego/Rapple  MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Anne Curtis has brought her love for Hallyu to her makeup brand blk Cosmetics, which is set to officially launch its K-beauty-inspired summer collection in April. The new line takes blk\u2019s promise of \u201cuncomplicated beauty\u201d to heart with products that can be applied with just your finger, and will fit in even the smallest of makeup kits. \u201cWhen it\u2019s summer, I just like to wear sunscreen and cheek tint. We have the lipstick shades, we have the liquid eyeshadow. We\u2019re all about being an uncomplicated brand right so you don\u2019t really need all the makeup brushes and everything so it\u2019s easy \u2013 you just use your fingers and you\u2019re good to go,\u201d Anne told Rappler at the opening of the first blk boutique at TriNoma on March 24. (IN PHOTOS: Anne Curtis opens first blk Cosmetics store) At the center of the blk summer collection is the K-beauty starter kit, which has everything one needs to create that fresh, dewy Korean makeup look: lip/cheek tints, liquid eyeshadow, and a BB/CC cream stick for coverage. It comes in a limited edition box with an inside cover that outlines a 3-step routine using the products.   The lip/cheek tints (P249 each) come in 4 shades: red, orange, cherry, and pink.    The liquid eyeshadow (P299 each) also comes in 4 shades: Hello (shimmery brown), Gorgeous (matte brown), I Love You (shimmery bronze-orange), and Cute (shimmery champagne).
