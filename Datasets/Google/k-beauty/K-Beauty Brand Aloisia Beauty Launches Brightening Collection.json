The K-beauty line is best known for being Hollywood\u2019s favorite skincare brand. Celebrities such as Kate Hudson, Adriana Lima and Alyssa Milano swear by its natural products. Hudson shared her obsession with the company during an episode of the \u201cFat Mascara\u201d podcast. The actress exclaimed, \u201cThey have an exfoliator [that] I have been using\u2026 I\u2019ve actually been doing it all over my body. It\u2019s just kind of fun and it just sort of like, rubs the dead skin off. I do it on my hands and on my face\u2026 I love it. It leaves me all soft.\u201d The hydrating serums, moisturizers and exfoliants have recently expanded to include brightening products. The most recent drop treats common concerns such as hyperpigmentation, discoloration, dullness and more. The unique formulation includes six vitamins, antioxidants, humectants, and anti-inflammatory ingredients. \u201cOur new ANTI-AGING & BRIGHTENING Collection\u00a0is the culmination of two years of research and development to confront the loss of elasticity, clarity, and vibrancy that happens to the natural skin barrier over time,\u201d said Veronica Konecke, Co-Founder. \u201cThis collection offers luxurious, effective solutions rooted in Korean skincare philosophies and innovation to achieve visible results and glowing skin, for all skin types and at any age.\u201d All of the female-founded company\u2019s brightening products use a concentration of probiotic-derived fermented filtrates, which have a smaller molecular weight for maximum absorption and potency, paired with other anti-aging and brightening actives. The products include clean and effective ingredients that most beauty lovers are familiar with such as niacinamide, green tea and patented d-phytogen which have become skincare buzzwords over the years. Aloisia Beauty places an emphasis on enriched skincare treatments and moisture preservation and its formulations are meant to deliver clear, hydrated, glowing skin with results you can visibly see.
