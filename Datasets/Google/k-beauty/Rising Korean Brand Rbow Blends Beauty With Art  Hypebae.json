The label\u2019s offerings range from hand and body creams, to lip balms and perfumes. Sohyung Kim, the brain behind the label, utilizes her previous experience as the former director at Gana Art gallery. \u201cThere are tons of cosmetics brands in the world but there was nothing inspired or connected with art,\u201d the founder explains. She additionally shares in a press release that Rbow aims to provide consumers with unexpected pleasure, just like a rainbow would. The brand\u2019s hero products include a line of fragrances, which are formulated in partnership with french perfumers Symrise and Firmenich. Key scents include \u201cDance and Balance,\u201d a spicy musk; \u201cO.A.C,\u201d a woody and floral aroma; \u201cUntitled,\u201d a spicy scent created in collaboration with contemporary artist Eddie Kang; and \u201cLights on Objet,\u201d which boasts hints of ginger and pink pepper.
