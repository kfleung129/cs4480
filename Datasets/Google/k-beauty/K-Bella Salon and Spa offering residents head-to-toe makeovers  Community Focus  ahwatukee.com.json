Updated: October 26, 2023 @ 2:34 am      Most women can probably agree there\u2019s nothing like a day of pampering. Georgiann Serpe, owner of K-Bella Salon and Spa in Ahwatukee, feels the same way and is offering free makeovers for deserving Ahwatukee residents. The salon is accepting written essays for those wanting to be selected for the makeover that includes nail services, haircut and/or color, a facial, and any other salon service. A new winner will be selected once a month. On choosing winners, Serpe said the essays should reflect \u201csomething that might have happened in their life that are deserving of a change, and could use a little TLC.\u201d For Mackenzie Kolb, a student at Arizona State University and an Ahwatukee native, the makeover was just what she needed after a college program at Disney World. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a lot of time for myself out there,\u201d said Kolb, who was the salon\u2019s first makeover winner. \u201cIt was a really nice experience.\u201d Over two days, Kolb got a manicure, pedicure, facial, haircut, highlights, and then a makeup application and hair styling for her \u201cbefore and after\u201d photos. Admitting she is one who doesn\u2019t stray from her normal, low-key makeup and hair routine, Kolb said she was nervous about coloring her hair for the first time and trying out new makeup. \u201c(The makeover) didn\u2019t let me down, it was fun,\u201d she added. Serpe said the makeovers at the salon originally began in 2004, when her former business partner came up with the idea. In an effort to bring the service back to life, Serpe hopes that the community would participate. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s time to pay it forward,\u201d she said. Serpe explained the beauty behind being pampered as a time to relax and regain an overall feeling of well being. \u201cWe\u2019re all about making people\u2019s lives a little happier, giving a fresh start, and doing good things for good people,\u201d Serpe said. K-Bella Salon and Spa is located at 1339 E. Chandler Blvd. To be eligible for a makeover, send an essay of no more than 500 words to info@kbellasalonandspa.com explaining your need for change through a makeover. \u2022 Contact writer: (480) 898-4903 or dmartinez@ahwatukee.com.

I have my own salon, which offers similar services, but still I envy this girl. About 10 years ago, when I finished college, I also went for a similar procedure and thanks to thisI realized that I also wanted to open a salon in order to bring women the same joy. Now I am very busy and have not gone to any procedures for a long time, especially now we are testing new software from beautyprosoftware.com. But as soon as the testing is over, I will definitely take a few hours to relax and pamper myself. Log In Keep it Clean.
