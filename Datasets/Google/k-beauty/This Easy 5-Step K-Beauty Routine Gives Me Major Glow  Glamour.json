    "text": "By Maureen Choi Photography by Michelle Sulcov When I was 12, I walked into the kitchen to discover my mother gingerly scraping the goopy jelly from an aloe leaf she had just picked from the garden into a mason jar. She poured two cups of soju\u2014a clear fermented-rice liquor from her native South Korea\u2014over the top, followed by the juice and zest of a lemon. To give the ingredients time to mingle, it went into the fridge for a month, right next to her smorgasbord of homemade kimchi. When the liquid was ready, she strained it through a fine-mesh sieve until every trace of muck was gone. The secret sauce left behind: so le al (Mama Choi\u2019s acronym for soju, lemon, and aloe), a DIY facial toner meant to brighten, tighten, and clarify her skin. She kept the concoction in a spray bottle and spritzed a mist all over her just-washed face every morning and night. Her routine was simple, cheap, and very effective, because that stunner is now in her late sixties and doesn\u2019t look a day over 45. A few years later, when I started dealing with breakouts, she gave me my very own bottle, along with a soap made of pungent oriental herbs and ginseng-infused lotion. I\u2019m embarrassed to say that, initially, I snubbed it all. Korean culture, food, and certainly its beauty secrets\u2014homespun or manufactured\u2014weren\u2019t cool in the nineties, and so I dismissed my mother\u2019s alchemist abilities and skin care know-how as weird and inferior. But when my teenage acne went next-level, I was despondent enough to think, What the hell\u2014give me the stinky K-beauty stuff. And you know what? The \u00adregimen worked. I fell in love with her recommendations because they cleared up my skin (suck it, zits), but I also loved how they made me feel. The twice-daily ritual felt fancy and insanely confidence-boosting and, if I\u2019m being honest, like a rite of passage\u2014of both mastering good skin care governance and appreciating my cultural roots. The ancient beauty wisdom of my ancestors had been bestowed upon me, and I was hooked. Fast-forward nearly two decades and the rest of the world has reached peak K-beauty love too. I\u2019m happy to be its number-one cheerleader. Snail slime? OK! Sheet masks on the daily? Into it! But there\u2019s one major thing I do have beef with: the idea that you \u201cneed\u201d to follow an excessive 12-plus-step routine to see results. Not true! In fact, streamlining your regimen, K-beauty or other\u00adwise, can be beneficial. Because the great paradox of the multistep, mix-and-match approach to skin care is that while you can get the perfect-for-you routine, you could also overdo it and turn your skin into a real grouch (as in current mood: red, irritated, and irrationally sensitive). I love products, and I\u2019m all for a little self-care moment. But you don\u2019t need a shelfie full of stuff\u2014or a ton of time\u2014to make good skin a reality. To help you cut through all the K-confusion, here\u2019s my no-B.S., tried-and-tested K-beauty course of action. Cleansing twice is the best way to ensure that every trace of gunk is removed. Dissolve makeup and pollutants first with a cleansing water like the one from Botanic Farm, then rinse at the sink with a cream cleanser, if you have normal to dry skin, or a gel formula, if you\u2019re oily, to break up any dirt and oil still lurking. Once you\u2019ve cleared the path, you\u2019re ready to add a ridiculous amount (like seven freakin\u2019 layers\u2019 worth, two to three drops at a time) of hydrating toner or essence. I\u2019m telling you, these thin layers of moisture are what make the biggest difference in your skin. Afraid it\u2019s going to feel heavy? Nah, Korean toners are formulated to be super concentrated but surprisingly whisper-light, so doing the \u201cseven-skin method\u201d is the best way to drive in moisture without clogging pores. I like the AmorePacific Vintage Essence\u2014it's pricey, but so hydrating. Pat in each layer to help maximize absorption. Choose a formula that targets the specific issues you need to treat (pores, lines, acne, dehydration) or an all-around winner like Peach & Lily's Glass Skin Serum. The patting technique you use for toner pays off big-time here too. This move's pretty self-explanatory; it\u2019s what locks in all that dewy goodness you just applied. Bonus points if your cream or lotion has free-radical-fighting antioxidants like the ones in Glow Recipe's Watermelon Moisturizer. No self-respecting Korean woman skips this step, because there\u2019s zero point in doing the moves above if you\u2019re going to let UV damage eff it all up. Using a broad-spectrum physi\u00adcal blocker like Neogen Day-Light Sun Screen SPF 50 daily can stop a host of concerns (hyperpigmentation, wrinkles, even skin cancer) in their tracks. Steadfastly do these five things every day, and there\u2019s no way you won\u2019t get better skin. True story.
