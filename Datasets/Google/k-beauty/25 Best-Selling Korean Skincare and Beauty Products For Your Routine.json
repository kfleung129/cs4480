The hashtag #koreanskincare alone generates 1.3 billion views on TikTok (at the time of writing), with rows and rows of videos on how to achieve glass skin, what products are great for hyperpigmentation, and which sunscreens won't leave a pasty white film behind. Everyone is on the hunt for smooth, filter-like, glass skin and we have the rise of K-Beauty brands and education surrounding Korean skincare practices to thank. Scroll through enough videos and you'll learn the number one rule of K-Beauty: skin comes first. \u201cK-beauty has a \u2018skin-first\u2019 philosophy, which [prioritizes] caring for your skin and getting to the root of the condition, instead of covering it up with makeup. K-beauty has gained so much popularity in the US in recent years because of its high-quality ingredients, innovative products, accessible price points, and the fact that it is based on a lifestyle that is focused on having good skin care habits,\u201d Charlotte Cho, esthetician and founder of popular K-Beauty e-tailer Soko Glam tells ELLE.com. With the help of e-tailers like Soko Glam, healthy, clear skin is not only attainable but accessible. Now, skincare obsessives have an arsenal of products to choose from to help them achieve their skin goals\u2014but which ones are actually worth it? Below, the 25 best Korean skincare products to add to your cart, plus some of Cho's favorites. Double-cleansing is a tedious step, so here's a gentle balm that removes every trace of makeup, sunscreen, and oil with a nourishing formula of  vitamin E and fatty acids. Amazon star rating: 4.7/5 stars An Amazon reviewer said: \u201cThis is a great cleansing balm. The packaging is attractive so I don\u2019t mind leaving this on my counter. A little goes a long way so this should last a good while. This cleans my skin really well with little effort. My skin feels and looks so amazing after using too. I would purchase again!\u201d If your skincare routine is packed with strong actives, this mask by Dr. Jart+ is basically a band-aid for inflamed, irritated, or stressed skin. Sephora star rating: 4.6/5 stars A Sephora reviewer said: \u201cI have acne prone skin and I struggle with picking my face. This is THE best product I have used, and I\u2019ve tried everything. It heals 75%-90% of my acne almost completely over night, even open wounds.\u201d Corsx\u2019s bestselling essence is always out of stock, and for a good reason. Touted for imparting a surge of hydration to parched skin, the lightweight, slimy mixture also repairs, soothes, and brightens the skin. Ulta star rating: 4.7/5 stars An Ulta reviewer said: \u201cI purchased this 5 days ago and have used it consistently in the morning and night applied to damp skin and under moisturizer. I have eczema and sensitive skin, and I highly recommend this stuff! I wake up with clearer and more hydrated skin each day.\u201d As a self-professed lazy beauty girl, I'm a sucker for any product that does all my hard work so I can get to bed faster. At the end of the day, I always reach for Sulwhasoo's cleansing oil, which is less oily and more of a gentle soap, because the moisturizing formula strips away any traces of a long day so my skin can reset for the day ahead. Amazon star rating: 4.3/5 stars An Amazon reviewer said: \u201cI absolutely love how it goes on as an oil to remove waterproof makeup but rinses off with just warm water. Leaves your skin feeling soft and hydrated.\u201d Glass skin is exactly what this serum aims to give you, and it delivers on its claims thanks to a potent cocktail of niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, peach extract, and more. Ulta star rating: 4.5/5 stars An Ulta reviewer said: \u201cNotice results in a week, which is rare for me. I finally decided to buy after dappling into skincare for the first time and was not disappointed! Expensive feeling packaging. Everything about it is great.\u201d Amorepacific comes at a higher price point than most K-Beauty products, but that's because your skin is receiving the absolute best of the best ingredients. Hyaluronic acid and green tea enzymes join forces to provide the ultimate hydration in this cleansing powder. Amazon star rating: 4.6/5 stars An Amazon reviewer said: \u201cThis has been the best cleanser for my oily, finicky, zit-prone skin. I use it morning and night. Cleans and polishes and does not dry out my skin. Love it. Also, a gem to travel with since not a liquid.\u201d This essence is tailor-made for those with acne-prone or sensitive skin. Missha used the special herb artemisia extract and its anti-inflammatory properties to clear out clogged pores and soothe skin. Soko Glam star rating: 4.5/5 stars A Soko Glam reviewer said: \u201cMy husband and I both love this so much. We both have sensitive skin. My husband used this after being on accutane. Super hydrating and calming. I use this everyday, twice a day and as a great base for my makeup routine.\u201d Banila\u2019s cleansing balm is a non-irritating formula that can remove makeup on the face and eyes\u2014worry-free. Ulta star rating: 4.4/5 stars An Ulta reviewer said: \u201cThis stuff seriously is so good. I put a little on, rub it all over my face, and whip it off with the makeup erase towel and EVERYTHING comes off the first swipe. LITERALLY MELTS YOUR MAKEUP OFF.\u201d Mimic the sunkissed glow of your dreams with just a few drops of this serum. After a few uses, watch your skin woes slowly disappear with the help of niacinamide and betaine salicylate. Amazon star rating: 4.5/5 stars An Amazon reviewer said: \u201cI love skin products that have rice in them because they\u2019re gentle, yet effective. I use this product in my nightly routine and noticed it immediately makes my skin softer and brighter.\u201d Remember when watermelon-infused skincare was all the rage? We have Glow Recipe to thank for keeping that movement alive. The brand's cult-favorite Dew Drops wakes you up with a light watermelon smell and brightens dull skin over time. Tired, aging skin doesn\u2019t stand a chance against this supercharged cream, which plumps and revives skin with Sulwhasoo\u2019s signature Ginsenomics complex built around soothing ginseng. Sephora star rating: 4.5/5 stars A Sephora reviewer said: \u201cThis formula is amazing!!! Leaving my skin feeling plump and nourished! The packaging is luxe, and I love the ingredients used!

Amazon star rating: 4.6/5 stars An Amazon reviewer said: \u201cI love COSRX and this product did not disappoint. You put these patches on top of any pimple and it'll help minimize the appearance and get rid of it. They work very well and they're super easy to use. They stick well and they're easy to take off, exactly like a sticker.\u201d Snail slime extract in skincare is commonly used to repair the skin and restore moisture. This cream is formulated to be a savior for damaged skin that desperately needs healing, hydration, and radiance. Amazon star rating: 4.5/5 stars An Amazon reviewer said: \u201cI\u2019ve been using this product for about 7 years, and it is the holy grail of all my skincare products. It is so light, yet very moisturizing and healing. It has a wonderful smell and absorbs quickly. I cannot believe how soft and hydrating this is on my skin. Cannot recommend enough!\u201d This lip mask needs no introduction because, by now, you've likely come across rave reviews of this Laneige bestseller online or here at ELLE.com. With each stroke, your lips are enveloped in a buttery blend of vitamin C and antioxidants that leave your pout soft and kissable. Here\u2019s another snail mucin-infused product worthy of all the hype it\u2019s received. The slimy gel-like formula transforms to a light liquid when smoothed across the face and absorbs quickly to give parched skin deep nourishment. Soko Glam star rating: 4.8 stars A Soko Glam reviewer said: \u201cI absolutely love this essence. It is light on the skin and my skin feels refreshed and clean all day. Highly recommend this product.\u201d This feather-light eye cream delivers supple skin for up to 26 hours. Thanks to its light consistency, it can be applied right before makeup to prevent any cracks or creasing. Amazon star rating: 4.7/5 stars An Amazon reviewer said: \u201cLove how it makes my eyes feel. Gives the extra moisture without the greasy feeling.\u201d Where some sunscreens leave you a greasy mess, Innisfree\u2019s iteration offers a soft, light veil of protection that blends like butter into the skin. Amazon star rating: 4.6/5 stars An Amazon reviewer said: \u201cThis sunscreen leaves no white cast, [is] easy to spread on the face, and has a great scent. It\u2019s not expensive and great for travel. I have one in my room, my car, and my purse. My go-to sunscreen.\u201d This cleansing oil was created for those with oily or acne-prone skin to ensure your skin is being properly treated from the very first step. As your makeup is removed, salicylic acid removes excess oil and dirt to clear congested skin. Ulta star rating: 4.4/5 stars An Ulta reviewer said: \u201cI use this product in the shower in the mornings to cleanse my face. I love the citrus scent. I have sensitive skin; this product works for me. It leaves my skin silky smooth after using it.\u201d If your skin is looking for relief, you can find it in this bottle.

Amazon star rating: 4.5/5 stars An Amazon reviewer said: \u201cThis is a great serum, very slick but not sticky or greasy. Good for sensitive skin.\u201d No pamper routine is complete without a sheet mask\u2014and a glass of wine. This set of sheet masks encourages you to rest as it strengthens and repairs the barrier with a calming formula of calendula extract, hyaluronic acid, and avocado extract.
