    "text": "Kim Kardashian trusts her glam squad so completely that the star didn't even feel the need to do a makeup test before her wedding to Kanye West on May 24. \"We didn't have a trial,\" the E! star's makeup artist Mario Dedivanovic tells E! News exclusively.\u00a0Oh, and\u2014this might be even more surprising\u2014there we're no inspiration pictures either. \"No photos. Kim just let me do my thing. So, I kind of created it on the spot,\" Mario explains. \"I saw the dress, we spoke about it, and she let me do my thing.\"\u00a0The results were quite stunning. \"I didn't want to make too much of a statement with her makeup. We decided to go with something natural and timeless,\" He shares. \"I wanted to go with something clean and classic\u2014and I wanted her to look almost angelic.\" VIDEO: Kimye's official wedding photos\u2014watch now! First step? A heavenly glow. \"I went for radiant, dewy skin.\" Next, Dedivanovic \"used very warm tones on the eyes, and a liquid eyeliner on top of the lids.\" He adds: \" I enhanced her lashes\u2014that was a big part of her look.\"\u00a0Then came time for Kim's lips, which had to be (picture) perfect for her first kiss with West as husband and wife. \"For the ceremony it was more of a creamy peachy pink lip,\" says Mario. \"For the reception, I went with more of a classic nude lip.\"\u00a0And although Mario says \"Kim was very happy with her makeup\" that doesn't mean he thinks all brides should try their impromptu method. \"I think it's important to do a trial. I didn't do a trial with Kim because we have worked together so long.\" To see the road to Kim and Kanye's wedding\u2014from Los Angeles to Paris to Italy\u2014tune in to the new season of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, premiering Sunday June 8 on E!.
