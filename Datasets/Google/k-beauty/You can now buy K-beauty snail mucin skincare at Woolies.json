Are the \u2018fresh food people\u2019 getting a fresh face? Maybe, with today\u2019s announcement the grocery giant is now stocking a selection of K-beauty products. Renowned for its meticulous formulations, layering philosophy and hydrating\u00a0properties, a Korean skincare offering is\u00a0now available to shop\u00a0through Woolworths\u2019\u00a0Everyday Market\u00a0online store. The move is the result of a partnership with Australian K-beauty platform,\u00a0Style Story. Founded in 2014 by Brisbane-based beauty enthusiast Lauren Lee, Style Story has grown from a basement-run operation to a global K-Beauty platform. As is often the case, Korean skincare was once almost impossible to find in Australia (I know from paying exorbitant fees in parcel forwarding). Style Story has brought a diverse collection of affordable,\u00a0award-winning\u00a0K-beauty products to our faces \u2013 and now our grocery baskets. So which K-beauty products can you pick up with your bread and milk? The current Woolies offering is a selection of the internet\u2019s most beloved beauty and skincare gems. It includes FJ\u2019s\u00a0tried-and-true\u00a0snail mucin slime. And not one, but\u00a0two\u00a0jelly-textured sleeping masks! How far the humble grocery store has come. Alongside the bestselling Cosrx\u00a0cleanser, arrivals include a\u00a0green tea seed-infused eye cream, an iridescent\u00a0skin balm, a cloud-like\u00a0enzyme cleansing foam, a cherry blossom-scented\u00a0face mask\u00a0and Laneige\u2019s famous\u00a0Lip Sleeping Mask. I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m looking forward to picking up snail mucin with my spaghetti bolognese ingredients. Shop Woolies\u2019 full skincare offering here.
