Our products are hybrid \u2014 simply four steps, 0,1,2,3, versus the K-beauty 10-step regimen,\u201d said Banila Co. USA general manager Juhan Kim. The shortened process could hit the mark with America\u2019s Millennial and Generation Z consumers who lead busy lifestyles and haven\u2019t been brought up with the Korean skin-care traditions, said Nadia Kanwal, the U.S. marketing representative for Banila Co., a subsidiary of Seoul-based fashion company F&F. \u201cWe make it easy and practical, especially for Millennials who don\u2019t have time for the complicated rituals of Korea,\u201d she said.  Even with its simplified approach, Banila is one of the top-three cosmetics brands in South Korea, according to Kanwal. The line has been available in America through Peach & Lily and Soko Glam but is now rolling out a selection of 24 items on Amazon.
