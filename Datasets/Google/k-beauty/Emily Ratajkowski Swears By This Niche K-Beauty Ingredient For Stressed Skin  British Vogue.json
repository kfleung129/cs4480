By Hannah Coates There are beauty trends and then there are beauty trends. One example in the latter category is the K-Beauty convert\u2019s inclusion of snail mucin in their no-stone-left-unturned, 12-step skincare routine. It\u2019s a trend that hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by Emily Ratajkowski, who shared her own favourite snail product on her Instagram Stories on Sunday. \u201cSo my skin freaked out at the beginning of quarantine but now I\u2019m using Dr Loretta cleanser, this amazing snail [product] \u2013 yes snail \u2013 then I put a retinol on,\u201d she said when asked by a follower for details of her skincare routine. Retinol is one way to address skin that has \u201cfreaked out\u201d, but snail slime is quite another.

The product in question appears to be the Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence, which is designed to be used after cleansing to replenish moisture and soothe angry skin. Cosrx also offers a snail slime-infused moisturiser (the Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream), and SPF (Shield Fit Snail Essence Sun SPF 50). Full of hydrating hyaluronic acid, copper peptides and with antimicrobial properties, snail mucin is a brilliant ingredient for all kinds of skin that\u2019s in need of calming, whether it\u2019s acne or rosacea-prone, or just really dry. It does a brilliant job at accelerating wound healing, while protecting skin from the environment and soothing areas in need of TLC.

Concerned about the welfare of snails? Importantly, no harm befalls them during the harvesting process (which sees them slither their way over a mucin-catching net for half an hour in the dark). Plus, if those shimmering trails are anything to go by, Ratajkowski\u2019s skin is glowing for a reason.
