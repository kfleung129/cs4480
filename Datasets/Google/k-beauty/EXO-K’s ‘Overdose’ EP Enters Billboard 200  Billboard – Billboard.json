By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJeff Benjamin American fans were ready to \u201cOverdose\u201d on the two new EPs from K-pop boy band EXO. \u201cThe 2nd Mini Album \u2018Overdose'\u201d was released in both a Korean and Chinese version by EXO subgroups EXO-K and EXO-M, respectively, and both proved addictive to U.S. audiences. EXO-K\u2019s version of the five-track EP flies into the Billboard 200 at No. 129. The South Korea-focused outfit sold 3,000 copies of their all-Korean set, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

EXO-K\u2019s first-week sales surpass the chart position of fellow boy band BIGBANG, who hit No. 150 on the Billboard 200 with \u201cAlive\u201d in 2012. BIGBANG had sold 4,000 copies with that release. And while EXO-K can claim the highest-charting set for male Korean acts, the guys still fall behind two of K-pop\u2019s superwomen groups. Both 2NE1 and Girls\u2019 Generation boast higher chart positions and bigger first-week sales with their \u201cCrush\u201d album and \u201cMr.Mr.\u201d EP, respectively. \u201cCrush\u201d hit No. 60 while \u201cMr.Mr.\u201d came in at No. 110\u00a0on the Billboard 200 this past March. As the third K-pop act to hit the Billboard 200 album chart this year, 2014 looks similar to 2012 when BIGBANG, BIGBANG\u2019s leader G-Dragon and the Girls\u2019 Generation\u00a0splinter group Girls\u2019 Generation \u2013 TTS\u00a0all made bows on the Billboard 200. Meanwhile, EXO-K also boasts their best showing on the K-Pop Hot 100 with \u201cOverdose\u201d debuting at No. 2 this week. All songs from EXO-K\u2019s \u201cOverdose\u201d EP chart inside the Top 25.
