    "text": "Amorepacific's affordable beauty brand Etude House is closing shop in China, showing retailers just how competitive the country\u2019s beauty market can be. With its affordable prices and princess aesthetic, Etude House has long served as a haven for young girls. Its store design is a cross between a fairytale castle and a dollhouse, boasting a dreamy, pink interior, checkered floors, chandeliers, and even a Cinderella-like carriage. Dedicated to fostering a\u00a0\u201cculture of Makeup Play\u201d\u00a0and helping beginners\u00a0\u201cdiscover [their] true beauty,\u201d\u00a0the Korean label has conquered hearts around the world. But now, it joins a list of brands that have bitten the cosmetic-grade glitter dust: after seven years of operating in the mainland, Amorepacific-owned Etude House is shutting its doors. In early March,\u00a0local media reported\u00a0that the cult-favorite beauty line had closed all of its physical locations in China, with multi-brand retailer The Colorist now it\u2019s only offline channel. At its peak, Etude House had\u00a085 shops across 25 cities in China, with hundreds more in Korea and abroad. Though products are still available online (through the brand\u2019s flagship stores on Tmall, WeChat, and Little Red Book), how did it go from queen of the castle to locking its gates? Below,\u00a0Jing Daily\u00a0analyzes the obstacles Etude House faced in the market, what other retailers can learn, and whether this signals a closing chapter for K-beauty in China. Political tension taints brand perception Driven by relatively\u00a0open international exchange and a rising middle class, Korean cultural products became enormously popular in China at the beginning of the century, from musical acts like H.O.T. and Shinhwa to film and TV shows. It was on the back of this \u201cKorean Wave\u201d that K-beauty rose to popularity, with beauty conglomerates employing K-pop figures and product placements to boost sales. And it worked, for a while. \u201cMy Love from the Star,\u201d for example, was so well-received that the\u00a0YSL lipstick used by the female lead sold out worldwide\u00a0after the K-drama aired in 2014. As one of the official sponsors of the show, Amorepacific reaped major benefits, seeing sales of its skincare products and lipsticks jump\u00a075 percent and 400 percent,\u00a0respectively \u2014 largely thanks to China. That same year, Korean cosmetic exports to China increased\u00a089 percent year-on-year to reach $600 million. Since then, the tide on Korean products has turned. Part of this is rooted in politics: South Korea\u2019s decision to cooperate with the US to build the THAAD missile defense system in 2017 resulted in China banning Korean imports for two years. Naturally, this had an\u00a0immediate impact\u00a0on the beauty industry, from\u00a0local e-commerce sites discontinuing sales\u00a0to fewer Chinese tourists in Korea. But it\u2019s arguably the lingering effects, namely the anti-Korean sentiment and surging nationalism, that are proving more troubling. From 2013 to 2017, the growth rate of Korean cosmetics exports to China stood at 66 percent, but then tumbled to 20 percent in 2018. Etude House\u2019s earnings mirrored this drop, with\u00a0sales peaking in 2014, then plunging from $266 million to $177 million in 2017, down to $88 million in 2019. With this in mind, brands should be wary of how international relations can sway consumer behavior, particularly now as China-US and\u00a0China-EU ties rapidly deteriorate. COVID-19 disrupts beauty consumption K-beauty brands took a bigger hit once the pandemic struck. Not only were\u00a0online sales not enough to offset falling foot traffic, but shifting consumer habits \u2014 such as reduced spending on color cosmetics \u2014 put Etude House at a disadvantage. According to Amorepacific\u2019s 2020 results, the company as a whole suffered. Revenue for the fiscal year was down 20 percent to $3.9 billion, with cosmetics, which makes up almost half of its revenue, tanking 26 percent year-over-year. And Etude House fared the worst, being the sole brand among the group\u2019s 37 subsidiaries to face capital impairment. Due to cumulative net losses and the costs of restructuring shops, Etude House\u2019s total equity now stands at minus 6.6 billion won (minus $5.8 million), Amorepacific recently disclosed to\u00a0The Korea Times. Fortunately, the beauty industry in China remains resilient, albeit changed. For one,\u00a0above-the-mask makeup is on the rise, with Tmall data showing a 150 percent increase in sales of eye makeup products in February 2020. Skincare brands like\u00a0SkinCeuticals and Av\u00e8ne have also fared well in the country\u00a0by promoting their products as part of quarantine skincare routines and solutions for mask irritation. Beauty brands that want to stay relevant can lean into these COVID-related trends, framing their products as stay-at-home or mask wearing \u201cmust-haves.\u201d Weak brand positioning erodes market share Of course, not all of the Etude House\u2019s woes can be blamed on external factors. Playing a larger role in the brand\u2019s downfall, arguably, is its lack of differentiation. Many K-beauty brands that fall in the low- to mid-end price range have become popular for fast beauty, shaving the R&D cycle from a year down to just four months. While this allows for more frequent drops (and for brands to join the latest fads), it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean these products are more localized or innovative. \u201c[Innisfree, The Face Shop] and Skin Food all have the same characteristics: natural, healthy and affordable products. Regardless of the blessings of the Korean Wave, these brands are too homogeneous,\u201d said Kathy Liang, a former buyer at a Korean cross-border e-commerce platform, to\u00a0Vogue Business. Although Etude House distinguishes itself with its girly aesthetic, it too offers many products like sheet masks and cleansing oils that blur together with competitors\u2019. At the same time, the brand has struggled to grow beyond its starter pack positioning and keep up with consumers. \u201cThe consumers from its early days have gradually lost their student status and upgraded their consumption,\u201d retail industry analyst Yun Yangzi\u00a0explained to local media. \u201cHowever, Etude House maintains its affordable makeup positioning, ignoring the needs of old consumer groups while failing to attract new customers like affordable local brands Perfect Diary or Florasis.\u201d C-beauty rivals ride the \u201cGuochao\u201d wave Etude House initially won big with its cost-effective products, creative packaging, and quick turnaround, but these traits no longer distinguish it in today\u2019s competitive market. Not only do\u00a0C-beauty brands\u00a0also offer quality products at reasonable prices, but they have an even stronger grasp of which marketing tactics will appeal specifically to Chinese consumers. As Allison Malmsten, market analyst at Daxue Consulting, told\u00a0Jing Daily, \u201cDomestic brands have the advantages of pulling in Chinese artistic elements (Florasis, for example), curating their marketing tactics to WeChat or other platforms which are native to China (Perfect Diary), and understanding local skincare needs such as sensitive skin (Winona).\u201d As such, Chinese consumers are showing\u00a0greater preference for homegrown brands,\u00a0a trend known as\u00a0Guochao. Global players, therefore, should look to C-beauty for strategies to win the market, such as diversifying co-branding, cooperating with different levels of influencers, incorporating Chinese design elements and colors, as well as tailoring content to each unique digital platform. A new chapter for Etude House? But the rise of C-beauty doesn\u2019t have to mean the end of K-beauty, Malmsten said. \u201cTier-1 cities are the least influenced by the [Guochao] trend and are more likely to continue buying foreign beauty products,\u201d she explained. \u201cTmall\u2019s data shows only around 10 percent of domestic beauty brand consumption is in tier-1 cities in 2020.\u201d And this is where Etude House\u2019s partnership with\u00a0The Colorist\u00a0comes into play. Through the Chinese cosmetics retailer, the brand is still able to maintain a physical presence in the country and even penetrate new cities as the chain expands. The Colorists\u2019s popularity among young consumers \u2014 sparked by its\u00a0social media-worthy decor\u00a0and immersive experiences \u2014 can also help Etude House reach new audiences and elevate its perception as trendy and cool by association. Additionally, divesting from brick-and-mortar will help free up resources to ramp up e-commerce. So far, the brand is already taking a page out of their C-beauty\u2019s book by\u00a0collaborating with Hershey Kisses, which it is promoting heavily to its 1.5 million followers on Weibo. So while K-beauty has a lot of catching up to do, Etude\u2019s story isn\u2019t over yet. Perhaps these changes are exactly what it needs to get its fairytale ending.
