    "text": "By Sophie Hirsh If you want your skin to glow like Emma Watson's in Disney's live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast, Skin Inc. has you covered. The brand is known for making some excellent serums, and they recently partnered with Disney to create a limited-edition, Beauty and the Beast version of their famous Get Glowin\u2019 Serum Kit, called \"Disney's Beauty and the Beast Get Glowin' Serum.\" The company announced the collaboration on Instagram on Friday. \"Unveiling our much anticipated collaboration with Disney's Beauty and the Beast,\" Skin Inc. captioned a photo of the serum with a rose seemingly growing out of it. \"We celebrate this timeless story with the creation of an exquisite Limited Edition Disney's Beauty and the Beast Get Glowin' Serum, for all you modern heroines to take control of your skin and let your inner light shine. 6 more days to D-Day.\" The formula is reportedly a blend of three ingredients: plumping hyaluronic acid, brightening chlorella, and vitamin A, which work together to target dark circles and uneven skin tone. Skin Inc. first started teasing the special product several days ago with a sneak-peek video to Instagram that featured a bottle of serum surrounded by red rose petals. \"We have a top secret collab up our sleeves...do you know where this line comes from: 'She warned him not to be deceived by appearances, for beauty is found within.'?\" Skin Inc. wrote. The company followed it up with several hashtags, one of which was \"#taleasoldastime,\" making it pretty clear that something BATB-related was up their sleeves. The limited-edition kit will sell for $90 on Skin Inc.'s website starting March 15 \u2014 two days before the live-action film, starring Emma Watson, hits theaters.
