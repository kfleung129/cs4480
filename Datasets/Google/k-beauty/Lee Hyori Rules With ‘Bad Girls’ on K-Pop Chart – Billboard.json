The track also has a throwback feel led by piano, drum and funky guitar licks.

Lee Hyori dethrones 4minute who are currently riding high with the success of their first No. 1 on the K-Pop Hot 100. 4minute\u2013whose youngest member Sohyun is almost half Lee Hyori\u2019s age\u2013fall back to the No. 3 slot. As previously reported, the group is currently deciding how to extend promotions for their \u201cName Is 4minute\u201d EP with a possible new single. The group held a \u201cGoodbye Stage\u201d on music program show M! Countdown to retire the song on air. Take one last watch of the fun performance below:  The R&B duo VIBE\u2013aka Ryu Jaejan and Yoon Minsu\u2013made the highest debut last week at No. 2 with their single \u201cAs I Grow Older\u201d which slips to No. 10 this week. \u201cAs I Grow Older,\u201d off their fifth LP \u201cORGANIC SOUND,\u201d marks a major departure from their signature sounds. It\u2019s an acoustic ballad about, as the title suggests, a man who too late realizes the importance of love and misses his ex-lover more as he grows older. The eagerly-awaited comeback album\u2013their first in three years, like Lee Hyori\u2013also garnered a chart smash with tearjerker \u201cThe Last Time\u201d which peaked at No. 5 (at No.20 this week). The success of the \u201cORGANIC SOUND\u201d album has even brought their 2010 hit, \u201cPlease Come Back Again,\u201d to the charts at No. 71 this week.  Things aren\u2019t slowing down for this soon-to-be mother and bride Baek Ji Young as she soars up to the No. 12 spot this week with latest single, \u201cReminded of You.\u201d Baek Ji Young\u2019s latest track was gifted to her by the famed producer Brave Brothers (who\u2019ve crafted 2013 No. 1s for SISTAR19 and 4minute). The song is a disco influenced track modernized with a modern beat and lyrics that knock lovelorn ballads. Baek Ji Young\u2019s agency revealed in a statement that \u201cReminded of You\u201d will be the singer\u2019s last dance track before her wedding on June 2.   In other K-pop and chart news, Akdong Musician (who won the second season of singing competition \u201cK-Pop Star\u201d and have a group of several Top 3 singles, though No. 1s) announced they signed with major agency YG Entertainment aka PSY, BIGBANG, Gummy and 2NE1\u2019s label. The brother/sister duo\u2013known for their self-composed arrangements\u2013seem to be in good company if their fellow singing competition star Lee Hi is any indication. 16-year-old Lee Hi was the runner-up of the first season of \u201cK-Pop Star\u201d and wound up with two No. 1s on K-Pop Hot 100 since signing with YG. Needless to say, their official debut under YG will be a hotly-anticipated debut. Their latest offering \u201cBean Ice Flakes With Rice Cake\u201d is the Hot Shot Debut this week at No. 2. Check out a live showing of the duo putting an acoustic spin on YG artist G-Dragon (leader of BIGBANG) and his hit \u201cOne of a Kind\u201d on the show. The CEO of the label was watching them. Wonder if this persuaded him to sign them?  Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.
