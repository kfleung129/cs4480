    "text": "In 2022, let\u2019s make sure to focus on our skin. And who better to school us on how to achieve this than the industry\u2019s leading K-beauty? From tech futures to fermented tea and\u00a0kombucha\u00a0to the even more odd red onion, these are the biggest K-beauty trends to bookmark.   A post shared by Song hyekyo (@kyo1122)  The quest for a healthy glow is quite popular \u2014 one of the primary trends in Korean beauty is being confident in one\u2019s own skin and a focus on healthy skin. Instead of glass skin, go for a basic routine that includes nourishing and brightening ingredients such as propolis and hyaluronic acid. Shop Tosowoong Propolis Sparkle Ampoule Here Shop It's Skin Hyaluronic Moisture Serum Here There will be a lot more retinol-based skincare in 2022 and more unexpected discoveries on plant extracts with therapeutic characteristics such as red onion. Furthermore, there will be significant growth in awareness of the sustainable packaging and beauty movement. Shop Isntree Onion Newpair Gel Cream Here   A post shared by Kourtney \u2764\ufe0f (@kourtneykardash)  Over the last decade, there has been a steady growth in demand for at-home and high-tech beauty gadgets such as full-face LED masks and ultrasonic facial cleansers. COVID has undoubtedly pushed this K-beauty trend, with at-home beauty tech solutions now in high demand throughout the world. The prediction is that your next Korean beauty product will come from a Korean tech giant, such as LG or Samsung, rather than a typical Korean skincare brand. Shop Skin Gym Wrinklit LED Mask here There\u2019s a strong trend toward simplifying routines. Not that anyone has abandoned multi-step regimens, but multi-use items are really blazing bright and attract people\u2019s attention. Any products that pamper the skin while simultaneously saving time at the sink seem to be the current rage. Shop It Cosmetics CC+ Cream with SPF 40 Here   A post shared by Beauty by the Beach (@beautiesbythebeach.386)  According to experts, we will continue to witness a shift toward more vegan-friendly products and environmentally friendly packaging. Due to their single-use feature, it appears that the industry is shifting away from sheet masks and toward wash-off masks. According to experts, several brands will release more sensitive skin-friendly formulas as well as mild, unscented formulations. Products containing fermented components that are also known to have anti-ageing benefits, such as fermented tea and kombucha, are becoming increasingly popular. Shop Fresh Kombucha Treatment Essence Here What will be the next snail mucin, the gloopy (and moisturising) secretion found in so many Korean sheet masks and serums? Snail mucin, to be precise. But without the snail. \u201cThe younger generation of Koreans cares more about animals, and as a result, vegan skincare is in the forefront of their minds,\u201d experts say. (Snails aren\u2019t killed for their mucin; instead, their mucin is collected and sterilised after they crawl over the mesh.) \u201cWithin the next year, you\u2019ll see brands introducing \u2018phytomining,\u2019 a vegan substitute.\u201d It\u2019s prepared using wild yam, okra, or seaweed. \u201cSeaweed and okra have similar moisturising and firming benefits as snail secretions,\u201d experts say, and \u201cwild yams may have antioxidant and moisturising benefits.\u201d Shop La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Cream Here Experts believe that K-beauty would consist of more efficacy-based skincare products that focus ingredients such as vitamin C, retinol, and AHA/BHAs. More and more individuals are seeking for ways to maintain their skin healthy at home. Look for multi-purpose but effective skincare that may address many skin demands such as anti-aging, skin brightening, less breakouts, and skin smoothing. Shop Sunday Riley C.E.O Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream Here Because vitamin A is still quite popular, experts predict that more Korean brands will produce retinol/retinal products in 2022. We will also see more maskne-treating skincare products and long-lasting makeup that can be worn while wearing a face mask, such as transfer-proof lip products and cushion foundation that transfers less.

This isn't an excretion that comes out as the snail moves, but rather a substance secreted when the snail is stressed. Anushka likes to write about fashion, beauty, and other nice things.
