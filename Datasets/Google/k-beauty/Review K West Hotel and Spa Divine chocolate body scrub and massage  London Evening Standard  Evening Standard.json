    "text": "Lifestyle | Beauty To celebrate chocolate week, K West Hotel & Spa have conjured up a chocoholic treat with Divine chocolate for those with a sweet tooth. Experience The 55 minute treatment starts with the Chocolate and Sea Salt Body Scrub, which I was told encourages the production of endorphins and helps to firm the skin \u2013 something I was definitely in need of. Every last inch of dry skin was exfoliated away, my pores could breathe again, and the cellulite was shifting, before hot mittens wiped away the scrub in preparation for the massage. Limb by limb I was slathered in the dark chocolate and honey balm as the masseuse slowly kneaded and coaxed my muscles with fingertips, hands and forearm before firmly tickling and teasing away the tension in my shoulders. After bringing myself around, I was left to sip on a Divine chocolate and chili martini in the sanctuary of the Relaks room. Results I was left thoroughly relaxed and with deliciously smooth, chocolate infused skin. Simply Divine! Cost The K Spa Divine Day Package costs \u00a385 and is available from 13 to 19 October.
