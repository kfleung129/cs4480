    "text": "This winter, many people are dealing with unbearably dry, patchy skin. But lucky for you, dermatologists have a simple solution. The latest viral skincare trend is called \u201cslugging,\u201d which involves coating your face in petrolatum, or Vaseline, to moisturise your skin overnight. Though the fad has become a talker recently (with over 80 million views on TikTok), it is not particularly new. It has long been popular in the Black community as well as in the K-beauty world to replicate that natural, dewy glow and combat dryness. A trend called time blocking is taking over TikTok. What is it? \u201cPetrolatum is an underrated ingredient that dermatologists have used for so many different things, including slugging,\u201d says Dr Jenny Liu, a Fellow of the American Academy of Dermatology. \u201cNot only has it been used safely for babies as a body moisturiser, or used on wounds \u2026 but it offers great hydration to dry and irritated skin.\u201d Many people have used slugging to obtain plump skin at home, because it only requires one product. All you need is a thick, ointment-based moisturiser like Vaseline, Aquaphor, CeraVe Healing Ointment or Cetaphil Healing Ointment. Experts say slugging should be used as the last step of your skincare routine \u2013 after cleansing and moisturising. Dr Lindsey Zubritsky, a board-certified dermatologist with over 400,000 TikTok followers, recommends a \u201cvery thin layer\u201d over your whole face \u2013 especially during the winter months. \u201cBy adding this as the final step to your nighttime regimen, it works well to keep skin moisturised and hydrated all night long \u2026 It also allows the skin barrier to repair by acting as a protectant,\u201d she says. This is because unlike most lotions, Vaseline isn\u2019t absorbed directly into the skin. Rather, it acts as a surface barrier to \u201cprevent further water loss and lock in hydration,\u201d Liu says. However, the trend may not be for everyone. Though petrolatum in itself is unlikely to clog pores, it can still irritate acne-prone skin and potentially cause breakouts. \u201cIn general, if you have oily, sensitive skin, you may not like slugging because it can feel heavy and greasy,\u201d Liu warns. Zubritsky also recommends avoiding slugging in combination with any active ingredients like retinols, retinoids, alpha-hydroxy acids, or beta-hydroxy acids, which \u201ccan cause more irritation and sensitivity by locking these strong ingredients on your skin.\u201d ",
