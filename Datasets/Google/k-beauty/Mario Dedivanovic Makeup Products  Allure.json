    "text": "By Renee Jacques At this point, the name Mario Dedivanovic shouldn't just ring a bell: With clients like Kim Kardashian, Chrissy Teigan and Chanel Iman\u2014and a few sold-out Master Classes under his belt\u2014you should be intimately familiar. But just because he works with one of the most famous women in the world doesn't mean he uses only high-end products on her. Yesterday Dedivanovic gave all his Snapchat followers a treat when he casually strolled into a CVS in Miami and started sharing snaps of his favorite drugstore products (his Snapchat is \"makeupbymario,\" btw). First, Dedivanovic loves to use L'Or\u00e9al Paris Voluminous Mascara in Carbon Black because it provides \"two times the intensity.\" We're not sure what he's comparing it to, but sure! When it comes to makeup sponges, Dedivanovic likes Beauty 360 Jumbo Cosmetic Wedges. \"These sponges are great to apply moisturizer and setting powder under the eyes, and they expand when you wet them with water,\" he says. Dedivanovic also likes to use Essence of Beauty Wedges because \"they are really soft and really feel good on the face.\" Moving on to false lashes: Dedivanovic swears by Ardell. He also likes__Ardell Natural Demi Wispies__ because \"they look really pretty on the eyes, and you can double-stack them,\" he says.
