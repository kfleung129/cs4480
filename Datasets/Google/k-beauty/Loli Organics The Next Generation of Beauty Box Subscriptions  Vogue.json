By Louise Hart If you\u2019ve ever dreamed of the beauty equivalent of a dinner-prep kit\u2014think fresh, farm-to-table ingredients delivered straight to your front door and made for DIY mixing \u00e0 la Blue Apron or Plated\u2014you\u2019re officially in luck. Each month, skin care enthusiasts who sign up for the fledgling at-home subscription service known as Loli will receive an eco-friendly recyclable box filled with neatly packaged tins of wild harvested, fair trade, or food-grade ingredients and a customizable recipe. Founded by former beauty industry pro Tina Hedges, who logged time at companies like L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Est\u00e9e Lauder before leaving to develop her own niche brand, Loli promises to offer the same kind of gratification\u2014and relaxation\u2014that comes with making a meal at home. Here\u2019s how it works: Each kit has a different focus: face, body, hair or bath. The individual ingredients inside are elegantly packaged, pre-measured, sustainably sourced, seasonal, and come with a step-by-step card with instructions for making your own series of treatments. This month\u2019s box, for example, comes packed with a small vial of pre-made chamomile-, lavender-, and witch hazel\u2013infused hydrating tonic, a container filled with powdered apple cider vinegar, a slim tube of citrus cleansing grains, and a set of neatly bound star thistle honey sticks\u2014all of which could be used in varying prescribed proportions to make both a brightening makeup remover-and-cleanser, as well as a separate exfoliating face scrub; previous boxes have led subscribers through the hand-mixing of a brown sugar-and-coffee body scrub, Himalayan bath salt soak, rejuvenating face mask, and gentle shampoo. But be forewarned: Once you start, you may never leave the house on a Saturday morning again.
