In honor of Rihanna's 30th birthday on February 20, Fenty Beauty released a new limited edition design for one of its most popular launches: Trophy Wife highlighter. The super pigmented, metallic gold cream-to-powder was an instant hit when the brand debuted back in September 2017. Now, its packaging has a celebratory new look. The Fenty Beauty Killawatt: Dirty Thirty highlighter ($34) now comes in a gold box that reads \"Dirty Thirty\" and the product pan is engraved with \"XXX.\" Currently, it's only available on Fenty Beauty's website. Rihanna even got gifted her version of the Dirty Thirty highlighter, but hers was naturally covered in Swarovski crystals. If you haven't tried out Trophy Wife yet (where have you been?), now's your chance. Allow the queen herself to show you just how unreal the golden glow looks like: The Rihanna navy doesn't play, so jump on this collectible before it sells out.
