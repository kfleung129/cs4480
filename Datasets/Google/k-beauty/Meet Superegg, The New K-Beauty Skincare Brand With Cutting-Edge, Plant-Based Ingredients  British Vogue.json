Her familial traditions had much precedent throughout Asian history: In 600 B.C. China, Zhang Lihua, a concubine recognised for her \u201clegendary beauty,\u201d was said to have whipped up a facial cream composed of egg white and powered vermilion, while in the last century of the Korean Joseon Dynasty, a guidebook for women called Gyuhap chongseo recorded a beauty regime of mixing eggs in liquor to be applied on the face for \u201cglossy, jade-like skin,\u201d Choi says. But while Choi has a deep-seated appreciation for eggs in their natural form, she felt compelled to rethink these traditions when she considered animal agriculture\u2019s impact on climate change, and the rise of animal and egg-related issues, such as allergens, diseases, and preservatives. She sought to create vegan products that could honour the egg and its properties, but in a friendlier, eco-conscious way. The journey to launching Superegg began three years ago, with Choi joining forces with her husband, Hoon Kim, a fellow graphic designer and creative consultant, to create a skincare line inspired by the \u201cclean egg\u201d that \u201cfelt elevated and efficacious, yet gentle, and addressed the skin\u2019s overall health.\u201d At the beginning, Choi examined the different aspects of the egg, and realised that each part of it \u2014 the egg white, yolk, and eggshell membrane \u2014 contains unique properties that benefit the skin. She began a meticulous formulation process to create special egg duplexes for each component with powerful, plant-based equivalents:\u00a0Egg yolk nutrients that help lock in moisture and smooth texture, such as collagen and lecithin, are duplicated with skin-barrier-function-supporting hydrogenated lecithin, restorative vitamin E, and soothing chicory root. Egg whites\u2019 vital components \u2014 protein and collagen \u2014 are simulated with moisturising soy protein, healing tremella mushroom, and calming rice extract. The eggshell membrane\u2019s water solubility is mimicked with hyaluronic-acid-boosting SYN-HYCAN and wrinkle-smoothing lupine protein to anti-aging effect. By Hannah Jackson By Alice Cary By Hannah Coates The first of Superegg\u2019s duo of debut products is Sound Renewal, a lightweight gel-cream that combines its special Yolk Duplex with supercharged humectant panthenol, hydration-boosting squalane, gently exfoliating PHA, and calming flower water to yield soft, supple skin. The packaging, a smooth, circular form, is inspired by scientist Piet Hein\u2019s superellipse shape, and is a \u201cnod to sunny-side ups,\u201d says Choi. Then comes Gentle Elements, a frothy, foaming cream cleanser that removes make-up, dirt, and excess oil while restoring and balancing the skin\u2019s pH with barrier-strengthening moringa oil, brightening vitamin C, hydrating hyaluronic acid, and the smoothing White Duplex. Given Choi\u2019s background as a graphic designer and content creator \u2014 she most recently held the role of vice president of digital design at Barneys \u2014 for her, crafting the brand\u2019s visual and experiential identity was just as important as the function and efficacy of the products. \u201cIt would have no life and no community without a brand story,\u201d says Choi of working alongside Kim, who runs creative consultancy Why Not Smile and has worked with a host of beauty clients (including K-beauty brands Dr. Jart+ and AHC) on everything from the packaging to the creative direction. \u201cQuality and aesthetics, as well as an appreciation for art, architecture, and design, are very important to me, and I wanted to bring this part of me into the brand,\u201d she adds. While the original plan was to launch Superegg this past spring, Covid-19-related supply-chain disruptions caused delays. \u201cThe silver lining was the massive amount of interest that skin care has received as people focused on their self-care rituals this year,\u201d says Choi. By Hannah Jackson By Alice Cary By Hannah Coates From its unique \u201cclean egg\u201d concept to the objet d\u2019art appeal of its packaging, Superegg\u2019s offerings are destined to appeal to natural beauty enthusiasts and major #TopShelfie players alike. But above all else, Choi just wants her burgeoning beauty brand to help individuals take a moment for themselves, and support the wellbeing of their skin and the planet (the brand is working with organisation 1% for the Planet). \u201cIn this day and age, where everything moves so quickly, and everything seems fleeting, I hope [we can] slow down and enjoy the small joys in life, even if it is as simple as taking a minute to celebrate ourselves with our daily rituals,\u201d says Choi.
