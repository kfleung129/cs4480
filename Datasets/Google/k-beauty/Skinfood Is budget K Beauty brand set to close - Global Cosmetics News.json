Items such as the popular Choco Eyebrow Powder Cake and Peach Cotton Pore Sun Pact were out of stock with a franchise owner stating, \u201cToday, the headquarters sent us an official statement saying that they will supply us as soon as they can.\u201d Indeed, it is thought to be over six months since some franchises have received products, with the same franchise owner continuing \u201cIt\u2019s been quite a while, maybe over half a year, since we last received supplies.\u201d However, the company has denied it is in trouble, with a spokesperson who didn\u2019t want to be named telling the paper, \u201cThe supply shortage is due to multiple reasons, some of it being a delay in raw material supplies and also sudden surges in sales for certain items.\u201d According to the paper the company has been in turmoil for some time, said to have been losing money since 2014. With the company\u2019s sales dropping 25 percent from 169 billion won to 126.9 billion won in 2017, an a report published by Anse accounting firm last year also predicted the uncertain fate of the company, \u201cSKINFOOD has to be watched closely because it has some uncertainties that can make its ability to survive questionable.\u201d Share: Rate: LATEST NEWS Unilever settles in trademark dispute ov...
