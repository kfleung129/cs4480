The resale market for parking spots and condos is steady with some ranging in price up to $60,000. Still, there are a few wrinkles in selling a spot. This article is over a year old, and the information within may be out of date. A parking spot can add $50,000 the price of a con suite. With parking a hot commodity for downtown residents who drive, condo owners are taking advantage of the demand and selling their parking spaces. A spot that was purchased for $18,000 about 15 years ago, for example, was recently sold by its owner for $38,000.  Still, that was a bargain compared to prices that begin at $55,000 \u2014 and generate bidding wars \u2014 for parking spots in newly built downtown condominiums. Most buildings have fewer parking spaces than condo suites, and many have no visitor parking at all. Yet even at $40,000 to $60,000, Toronto condo dwellers are still in a sweet spot. In cities such as London, England and New York, parking spots for multi-million-dollar condo units can run up to a cool one million dollars. In Singapore, one luxury builder has installed a parking elevator to bring owners\u2019 cars to their units where they are off-loaded into a special ensuite parking bay. A home with a two-bay parking garage is $7.7 million. In Toronto, the resale market for parking spots and condos remains steady with MLS for early March showing some 23 parking spots ranging up to $60,000 and also three lockers for sale with prices from $4,000 to $6,000. Still, there are a few wrinkles in selling a spot or a locker. First, read your condominium declaration, says Lorne Shapiro of Basman Smith LLP , a real estate lawyer who works with developers. \u201cIt\u2019s the bible and it will spell out what you can and cannot do,\u201d he said. While some older condo corporations may not have anticipated sales of parking spots and storage lockers, most declarations allow sale only to another owner in the building, Shapiro said. And there are reasons why: mainly security. Assuming it\u2019s permitted, selling a parking spot or locker is the same as selling title to your condo, he said. \u201cThe residential unit, parking spot and locker are all titled and numbered separately so there are no issues with title,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you have to pay the maintenance fees on them.\u201d You also might want to read over your mortgage documents if you\u2019re thinking about \u201cflipping\u201d a parking spot or locker soon after purchase, warns Robert Wong, a real estate broker with Keller Williams Realty . In fact, it\u2019s a good idea to check with your mortgage period. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a mortgage then the locker or parking spot will likely be included in the value of you condominium,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you sell the parking spot or locker, you have changed the value of the property and there could be a problem.\u201d With more downtown condos going up with fewer parking spots \u2014 the 42-storey project at the old Royal Canadian Military Institute on University Ave. near Dundas St., will have none at all \u2014 the price for those suites that do have spots, and the resale market for parking spaces, are both escalating. Politics has also raised its head in the condo parking issue. The city of Toronto usually demands .67 to .75 parking spaces per unit for most condos and up to 1.1 in some outlying areas but will waive that ratio depending on location. Homeowners in the Woodbine Ave. and Queen St. E. area in the Beach were recently incensed when they learned a 70-unit condo planned for the neighbourhood would have only 65 spaces \u2014 actually more than the requirement. The residents fear an overflow of cars will flood their streets and force those homeowners with street parking further from their regular spots. Of course, getting a parking spot with a condo all depends on location, location, location. Buyers in the suburbs usually expect parking included the deal, along with a locker, because transit isn\u2019t always close, fast or convenient depending on where they work. Singles, young couples and empty nesters who buy within the city\u2019s core for the lifestyle, however, aren\u2019t usually interested in parking spots said Jim Ritchie, Tridel\u2019s senior vice president of sales and marketing. Those residents don\u2019t rely on cars and instead use streetcars, subways, bicycles and even shared rides such as ZipCar or AutoShare when they need wheels, he said. \u201cA car is more important as you move away from the core,\u201d said Ritchie, explaining the demand curve for parking. \u201cCars are expensive,\u201d said Debbie Cosic, of In2ition Realty who specializes in marketing and selling new home developments. \u201cParking spots can add $50,000 to the cost of buying a condo, that\u2019s another $240 a month in mortgage payments. Then\u2019s there $300 a month for the car, $100 a month at least for insurance, gas. That\u2019s nearly $1,000 a month for something you don\u2019t need every day.\u201d Developers are increasingly reluctant to offer parking, she said. Because the cost of land continues to climb, they have to go higher to create enough units to pay back their investment costs. This, in turn, means developments with small footprints must go deeper to create multi-level parking floors. \u201cYou\u2019d think the cost would go down as they went down but it\u2019s the opposite, the costs increase the deeper you go to build more parking levels,\u201d Cosic said, adding the extras can also be bargaining chips to make or break a sale. \u201cIn the 905 and outside, if they\u2019re having trouble selling they throw in parking spots and lockers to drive sales.\u201d Wong agrees. \u201cIt does depend on where you want to buy,\u201d he said. \u201cTypically now, the new condos downtown are selling parking spots and lockers separately. But if you go out a bit, say Parklawn Rd. and Lake Shore Blvd., they might offer to throw one in.\u201d Even lockers are add-ins to a deal, Wong said, and can be sold off \u2014 more likely so because some of the lockers in new buildings are cramped and there is not always a ratio of one locker for each unit. The mix of units in a development will also dictate parking, Cosic said, noting those buying a two-bedroom unit and planning a family will likely end up getting car. They may anticipate that when they buy, even if they don\u2019t initially need parking. Meanwhile, buyers of small, entry-level units downtown won\u2019t make parking a priority. Lockers, too, are becoming premium items as condo spaces get tighter, she said. Most start at around $2,500 and go to $7,500, depending on size and location. Lockers in luxury buildings can hit $10,000. \u201cThere are some lockers we\u2019ve put in a project on the same floor \u2014 like a pantry \u2014 which are really cool,\u201d Cosic said. \u201cThey\u2019re in the nooks and crannies left after the mechanicals, like the plumbing and electrical, are run. Others are part of the parking space which people like, as well.\u201d Anyone can read Conversations, but to contribute, you should be a registered Torstar account holder.
