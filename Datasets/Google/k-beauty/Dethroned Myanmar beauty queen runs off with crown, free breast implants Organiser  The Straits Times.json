    "text": "YANGON (AFP) - A Myanmar beauty queen dethroned for alleged misconduct has absconded with her crown and free breast implants, the organiser said Friday. Ms May Myat Noe, winner of Miss Asia Pacific World Super Talent 2014, was flown to South Korea for preparation to become a K-pop star. But she was stripped of her crown for alleged dishonesty and bad behaviour, according to event spokesman David Kim in Seoul. \"She lied a lot to us about many things. Our past queens also complained - because of her, their reputations will suffer,\" he told AFP. \"We cannot manage her. We are very angry but we don't want a bad relationship between the Korean and Myanmar people.\" He said that the organisation had paid US$10,000 (S$12,500) for a breast enlargement operation to help her budding singing career. It also prepared two albums for her to record and provided choreographers and accommodation as part of several years of planned training and investment to turn her into a K-pop star, Mr Kim said. There was no immediate comment from the dethroned beauty queen, who was thought to have returned to her home country. As the former armed-ruled country opens up, Myanmar women are eyeing success in international beauty pageants. Last year, a United States-educated business graduate was selected as the first Miss Universe contestant to represent Myanmar in more than 50 years.
