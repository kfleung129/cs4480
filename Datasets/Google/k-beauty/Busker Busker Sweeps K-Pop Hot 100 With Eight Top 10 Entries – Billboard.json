It has dominated the chart with every track on the album zooming and battling their ways to the top slots. Eight out of the nine tracks entered the Top 10 with the lead single \u201cLove, At First\u201d debuting in at No. 1. Busker Busker\u2019s chart dominance is as follows: Related\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBTS' V Drops Two Very Different Remixes of 'Slow Dancing' Solo Single\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t10/05/2013\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tExplore\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tExplore\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee latest videos, charts and news\n\n\n\nSee latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news No. 1 \u201cLove, At First\u201dNo. 2 \u201cToo Much Regret\u201dNo. 3 \u201cLove Is Timing\u201dNo. 4 \u201cYour Lips\u201dNo. 6 \u201cNight\u201dNo. 7 \u201cCool Girl\u201dNo. 8 \u201cBeautiful Age\u201dNo. 9 \u201cAutumn Night\u201dNo. 11 \u201cJuliette\u201d Busker Busker\u2019s third No. 1 on K-Pop Hot 100, \u201cLove, At First,\u201d is an emotional guitar-driven rock ballad that moves the band away from their previous musical endeavors of catchy sing-alongs. The lead vocalist Jang Beom Joon transitions seamlessly from chest voice to spiraling falsetto as he expresses letdown of an abandoned relationship while members Brad Moore and Kim Hyung Tae showcase their musical dexterity on drums and bass, respectively. Busker Busker\u2019s compelling blend of impressive musicality, easy-to-follow melodies along with simple lyrics and their signature, low-key charm has placed the group as one of the most leading and successful band in the current Korean music scene.  Despite American-bred Moore receiving some public backlash after a revealing interview with NOISEY\u00a0where he spoke on the dark side of Mnet\u2019s \u201cSuperstar K\u201d (a competition show where the band was the runner-up contestant), the band is still riding high as they launched their nationwide tour, \u201c2013 Busker Busker Concert,\u201d on Oct. 3 in Busan, Korea. The tour will move through several cities in Korea until Nov. 2. Busker Busker move several top K-pop stars, including SISTAR\u2019s Soyou, G-Dragon, EXO and more, outside the Top 10. It will be interesting to see if the singles can regain their place in the Top 10 if Busker Busker\u2019s sales slow down.  Additionally, after a lengthy three-year hiatus, singer/actor Lim Chang Jung logs in at No.5 with \u201cA Guy Like Me.\u201d The track is a soft ballad in a minor key, composed by Baik Min Hyuk with Lim writing and helping compose too. The song is about a man\u2019s struggle of not being able to forget about his old flame.  Elsewhere on the chart, we see new entries from boy band INFINITE, who are in the midst of their world that stops in the United States next month. The group\u2019s new song \u201cRequest,\u201d created inconjunction for a deal with Samsung, begins at No. 50 on the chart. While the synthy, \u201980s-inspired dance track is not an official INFINITE single, it does see the group reunite with their longtime producers Sweetune, who crafted some of INFINITE\u2019s signature including \u201cThe Chaser.\u201d  Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.
