By Tish Weinstock Snail mucin. Bee venom. Glass skin. These are just some of the beauty trends to emerge from South Korea in the past five years. Whether you\u2019ve dabbled in a bit of donkey milk (good for rejuvenating the skin with protein and fatty acids) or you\u2019ve played it safe with a weekly face mask, K-beauty is everywhere right now. In fact, Allied Market Research says that by 2026, the K-beauty market will be worth an estimated \u00a315bn, while according to Jenni Middleton, director of beauty at WGSN, \u201cduring the coronavirus pandemic, consumers searched more for K-beauty, looking for innovative products to add to their lockdown beauty regimes.\u201d Like most cultural phenomena, K-beauty is ever-changing \u2014 what was big last year may not be as popular this year. As Middleton observes, we\u2019re seeing the traditional 10-step routine give way to a more minimalist approach as conscious consumers react against fast fashion and excessive packaging. Elsewhere, playful gimmicks such as colour-changing effects or jelly-like substances are being passed over in favour of science-backed formulas. To find out more about the biggest K-beauty trends of 2021, we spoke to some of the industry\u2019s leading skincare experts. \u201cHanbang ingredients are traditional herbal ingredients used in Korean medicines and they\u2019ve long been a staple in Korean life. For example, ginseng root, houttuynia cordata, sacred lotus and rehmannia boast anti-ageing, anti-inflammation and regenerative properties.\u201d This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. \u201cK-beauty has been incorporating more acid into its products, but with a gentle approach that focuses on striking the balance: too much can irritate and aggravate your skin, too little will yield no results, so products with an optimal amount is key. Use the right balance of AHAs and BHAs (plant and animal-derived acids) to gently exfoliate dead skin cells and smooth skin texture.\u201d \u201cCarrot seed oil is an unsung hero at the moment, although it has been used in K-beauty for more than 10 years. It contains vitamin A and is a great antioxidant. It\u2019s anti-ageing, anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, and anti-inflammatory \u2014 so it\u2019s ideal for anyone looking to brighten up their skin.\u201d \u201cK-beauty\u2019s \u2018skin first\u2019 approach will continue through 2021, especially given that self-care and skincare are so important right now. There\u2019s no denying retinol\u2019s powerful anti-ageing properties, but the K-beauty approach uses a lower percentage, so the skin stays healthier and less irritated. Retinol is highly efficacious without causing unnecessary damage.\u201d \u201c2021 is less about what\u2019s \u2018buzzy\u2019 and more about what\u2019s tried and true, with a focus on calming the skin. Centella asiatica [a herb grown in Asia, known for being anti-inflammatory] \u2014 or cica \u2014 is huge right now. With everyone dealing with the prolonged stress of the pandemic and dreaded \u2018maskne\u2019, soothing irritated, angry skin seems to be at the forefront of people\u2019s minds. Cica is the ingredient that everyone wants to add to their routine.\u201d \u201cMore brands are developing products free of chemical additives, artificial ingredients and fragrance. Products will be even more gentle with effective plant-based ingredients and many brands are becoming vegan as well. Consumers are more aware of what they put on their skin.\u201d \u201cThis year, inner and outer wellness brands and products will gain more popularity. For example, brands that focus on pre-, pro-, and postbiotics; microbiome-friendly skincare; and consumable supplements, which benefit both the skin and the gut. By Alice Cary By Hannah Jackson By Hannah Coates This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. \u201cK-beauty will shift more towards a holistic approach, linking skincare and internal health. I take probiotic supplements for my bouts of eczema and I love using K-beauty products with fermented ingredients. I regularly use 107 \u2014 it uses aged [seven and 10-year-old] vinegar [that promotes good gut health]. Their vinegar tastes delicious with honey!\u201d \u201cA few years back, we were oversaturated with the \u201810-step Korean skincare routine\u2019. The \u2018skincare diet\u2019 [using fewer products and steps] that followed was a pushback against that, but it was too restrictive for those who wanted more results than could be attained with just the basics. \u201cFlexible minimalism is a focus on clean and simple product lines, which makes customising your routine easier. There will also be a push towards pared-back lists of ingredients. Single and minimal ingredients are appealing because of their simplicity and high concentration of the hero component.\u201d \u201cSkincare has a functional element \u2014 it has to work and deliver results \u2014 but I expect products that provide meditative, soothing, and spa-like moments to take off in a big way. They can transport you mentally and emotionally to another headspace.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve started seeing \u2018skipcare\u2019 as a K-beauty trend, where the focus is on a pared-down, simple, and minimalist routine. We will be seeing more efficient and effective multitasking and versatile products \u2014 what we like to call \u2018hyphenates\u2019 or \u2018hybrid\u2019 skincare.\u201d By Alice Cary By Hannah Jackson By Hannah Coates This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. \u201cThe belief that \u2018skin is a reflection of your mental state\u2019 comes from Korea and growing up, my mother emphasised this to me many times. We\u2019ll see more barrier-strengthening ingredients that boost immunity, such as mushrooms, plus detoxifying herbs including mugwort and ginger. Ceramides [which form a protective layer to help prevent moisture loss and visible skin damage] will make a comeback, too.\u201d \u201cIn Korea, many body-care rituals originate from the bathhouse culture, where milk treatments are slathered on the face and body, and baths are steeped with skin-beneficial ingredients such as green tea and probiotics. During a difficult year, personal self-care has taken on new importance for many, so we expect to see the definition to include all of the skin, from head to toe.\u201d More from British Vogue: By Hannah Coates By Hannah Coates By Lauren Valenti By Naomi Pike More from Vogue Cond\u00e9 Nast Britain \u00a9 2023 Cond\u00e9 Nast ",
