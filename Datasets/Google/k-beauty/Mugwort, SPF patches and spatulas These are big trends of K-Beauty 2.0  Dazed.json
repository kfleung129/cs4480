    "text": "What comes to mind when you think about K-Beauty? Snail mucin and bee venom, maybe? Or overcomplicated skincare routines with more steps than you thought possible? Well, it turns out that we\u2019ve been getting Korean beauty practices wrong this whole time. \u201cThe biggest misconception is the ten-step skincare routine,\u201d says Jin Kwon. \u201cIn the international market, people think of the ten-step skincare routine to be Korean. It never existed in Korea, actually.\u201d No one in the UK is more informed on K-Beauty than Kwon, the founder of Korean Beauty distributor Tonic15. Highly curated and beautifully organised, the retailer is host to the best of what K-Beauty has to offer thanks to Kwon\u2019s insider knowledge and rigorous testing procedures \u2013 so who better than her to give us the lowdown on what trends and practices are actually being used by the locals? Kwon says that one of the main skincare concerns in Korean metropolises like Seoul is the impact of pollution on skin, with many people opting for skincare products that are gentle, soothing and non-irritating. Skin that is well taken care of is the goal. To achieve this, the locals believe in a more pared-back approach. \u201cMost Korean beauty brands and people think that if you have two or more [active] ingredients in one product, the more chances that it might irritate your skin,\u201d Kwon explains. This also applies to extensive skincare routines. If there are too many steps then there are more chances of ingredients not pairing well together, which can lead to irritation and inflammation. Plus when using so many products on the skin, it\u2019s hard to tell which ones are working well for you and which ones aren\u2019t. Since the beginning of Tonic15\u2019s journey, Kwon\u2019s mission has been K-Beauty 2.0. For her, it\u2019s not just about highlighting new trends, products and ingredients but also about re-educating the west on what we\u2019ve got wrong so wrong about K-Beauty. To help teach beauty aficionados in the UK the true ways of Korean Beauty, Tonic15 opened a pop-up in London this month, which will run through to January 2023, where customers can stock up on beauty faves, trial out new brands and get personalised recommendations from the staff. Here Kwon gives us the lowdown on what\u2019s really happening in the K-Beauty space and all the exciting new brands, trends and ingredients. \u201cKorean people believe that keeping your skin hydrated is the basis for everything,\u201d Kwon says. Hydration is a cure-all for many skin-related issues. \u201cOily skin becomes more oily when you don\u2019t have enough moisture in your skin, it then tries to compensate for that by creating more oil. So the best way to combat this is to keep the skin hydrated. Same with acne and blemishes, I find hydrating your skin helps balance and strengthens the skin barrier. Koreans tackle blemishes this way rather than using strong actives.\u201d K-Beauty enthusiasts swear by either layering a toner or an essence to help lock in hydration. Essences tend to be thicker than toners and lighter than serums, they help prep your skin for the rest of your routine and help increase the absorption of your serums and moisturisers into your skin. Kwon tells us you can use them interchangeably as long you find the right one. If you\u2019d prefer to use a toner stay away from ones with synthetic fragrances and alcohol. You could layer using the seven-skin method, which means applying your essence or toner seven times to your skin, but Kwon doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to layer seven times, but [Korean] people tend to layer their toners several times. They put a thin layer on their skin and then after a bit, apply another thin layer.\u201d Long a popular sport in the country, golf took Korea by absolute storm this summer and to protect their skin out on the course many Koreans took to wearing not just SPF but ergonomic C-shaped patches that physically block the sun. \u201cSunscreen is a super big category in K-Beauty because people think it\u2019s one of the best products to use for anti-ageing,\u201d Kwon says. Once users are done with their day in the sun, they can simply peel off the patches and dispose of them. While the trend hasn\u2019t reached our shores just yet, with the popularity of pimple patches skyrocketing these last few years, maybe it\u2019s only a matter of time before we are also physically blocking UV rays with cute SPF patches. South Korea has a strict policy on recycling which has resulted in many beauty consumers being more conscious of buying products that are packaged in recyclable materials. Kwon believes that the K-Beauty brand that has responded best to the newer policies in the country is Aromatica. The brand uses 100 per cent recyclable packaging materials, houses its products in recyclable glass or finest PCR (post-consumer recycled) plastic and launched refill stations at its stores. Aromatica also aims to be the first beauty brand in Korea to send zero waste to landfills and incinerators in 2025 by achieving a complete resource circulation via their package tracking control system. \u201cIn my personal opinion, this is the most sustainable brand I've ever seen, not just in Korean beauty, but across everything,\u201d says Kwon, who believes the brand is in a league of its own. \u201cThe company staff uses older electric cars. They\u2019re putting systems in place to be carbon negative.\" Despite many in the west associating K-Beauty with animal-derived ingredients like snail mucin, Kwon says the majority of beauty products, as well as diets, are actually vegan as that\u2019s believed to be more gentle for the skin. \u201cYou see more vegan beauty products than ones with snail mucin or any animal-derived ingredients,\u201d Kwon says. At Aromatica, for example, product formulations are made from 100 per cent pure essential oils and botanical plant extractions. Mugwort might sound like an ingredient from a witch\u2019s potion but the plant has become big in Korean culture in skincare and beyond. \u201cMugwort is very popular as it\u2019s really soothing and hydrating,\u201d Kwon says. \u201cIn Korea, we use it in our skincare and we use it as medicine. People believe that mugwort detoxifies the skin, not only the skin but the whole body.\u201d Koreans love the ingredient so much that they even have dedicated mugwort spas to rejuvenate the body from the inside out. If you are looking for somewhere to start, Kwon recommends the I\u2019m From Mugwort Mask. Centella is another star ingredient which is used to soothe inflammation, increase hydration and strengthen the skin barrier. Glass skin is a K-Beauty term to describe skin that is so smooth, poreless and luminous that it\u2019s almost reflective like glass. You\u2019ve probably seen countless people try to recreate it on TikTok where the hashtag #glassskin has over 600+ million views. In Korea, to achieve the effect many people have been turning to the viral Piccasso foundation spatula, a premium artistry make-up tool which helps apply products smoothly. While the spatula has been popular in Korea for the past year, Kwon was initially sceptical, unsure if it was worth the hype. \u201cWhen things are trending in Korea, it makes me very careful as I don\u2019t want to bring back something that could be gimmicky,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo I actually tried it like a few months ago and I loved it.\u201d The make-up tool was made in collaboration with Korean celebrity make-up artist Ham Kyungsik. \u201cHe came up with this method, he used it to apply foundation and then found it works really well. So he modified it by making the blade a lot longer and then the edges are a lot smoother. The weight distribution is really good. It\u2019s made specifically for the face,\u201d Kwon explains. \u201cIsoi, along with Aromatica, is a brand that\u2019s been very popular in Korea for around 10 years,\u201d Kwon says. The brand\u2019s best-selling Blemish Care Up Serum is a cult product \u2013 one of the most sold in the country \u2013 and made with Bulgarian rose oil and Centella extract for those with acne-prone skin. But if this product is so popular in Korea, why hasn\u2019t it also made a big splash in the west as well? \u201cA lot of [K-Beauty] brands that you see in the international market, people in Korea have never heard of. And a lot of brands in Korea that are doing so well, oftentimes the international market just doesn't know about them,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause they are already doing so well in Korea, these brands don\u2019t have the urgency to launch internationally.\u201d Kwon partners with a lot of brands like Isoi, that want to launch in the UK but aren\u2019t sure how. The Tonic15 founder helps with marketing, translation and product registration to ensure that all of the brands she carries are truly successful. \u201cThat\u2019s what differentiates us from other retailers,\u201d she says confidently. So if you\u2019re ready to come across new gems, reunite with longtime faves and get the best education on what's really happening in the K-Beauty world then head to Tonic15's pop-up store, located at Angel Central, 21 Parkfield Street, London N1 0PS.
