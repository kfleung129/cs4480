    "text": "Korean beauty\u00a0products have saturated our social media feeds and are now cemented in our regimes. \u00a0Yet if you thought the\u00a0trend had peaked with cartoon sheet masks and watery lotions, you'd be mistaken, as a new batch of beauty innovations are destined to command the same attention. \"The focus is shifting from the quirky, fun collections to ground-breaking formulations and smart application,\" says \u00a0Emily Saunders, Selfridges beauty buyer. As of next month, the department store is expanding its\u00a0offering by installing a South Korean Beauty Workshop, which will\u00a0debut with\u00a0six new brands\u00a0and continue to grow over time. \"This will give consumers the chance to explore, experience and embrace the latest\u00a0K-beauty products and easily integrate them into their daily ritual,\" says Saunders. Alexia Inge, founder of Cult Beauty believes the next phase of the K-beauty trend is down to the speed of product development. \"It's awe-inspiring. They never rest on their laurels even with incredibly successful products, the focus is always on improvement, which make it a skincare addict\u2019s dream,\" she says. So, for those who always want to stay ahead of the curve, here is the latest wave of products to pique your interest... When you think of Korean beauty it's likely that sheet masks spring to mind. Many European brands have replicated\u00a0the product and while an Oozoo\u00a0mask\u00a0might look similar when it's on, it actually offers a completely new approach. The potency issue of sheet masks,\u00a0whereby the active ingredients\u00a0could\u00a0loose their effectiveness, have tarred the trend slightly. Oozoo has avoided this entirely as\u00a0instead of pre-soaking the mask, the active formula comes in syringe and you\u00a0infuse the fabric\u00a0with the active\u00a0ingredients just before using it. While Oozoo might have been one of the first to come up with this concept, we're betting that by next year plenty of other brands will have joined the bandwagon. Thanks to J.One Jelly Pack, it is now\u00a0possible to condense your entire\u00a0morning skincare routine into one product. Part of a line\u00a0created by\u00a0Korean actress and beauty muse\u00a0Ha Ji- Won,\u00a0the products are\u00a0designed for fast-paced\u00a0women who are on a quest to bridge the gap between skincare and make-up. Best described as a treatment primer, it has a \u00a0heavy jam-like consistency. Don't be dissuaded, as the key is to pat it onto skin rather\u00a0than rub. Antioxidants work\u00a0to address free radical damage\u00a0and brighten the appearance of skin,\u00a0 while new Korean technology - fragmented hyaluronic acid - hydrates for a plumper-looking appearance. However it's\u00a0real star quality is it's\u00a0cosmetic-enhancing format that\u00a0grips onto make-up by creating a lock-tight surface across the skin. \u00a0Even at 9pm, you'll be sporting the same\u00a0picture-perfect skin that you walked out the\u00a0front door with. South Korean women\u00a0are fastidious about sun care, so when they champion an SPF, its worth taking note. Thank You Farmer Sun Project Shimmer Essence SPF 30\u00a0combines the skin-plumping hydration of a moisturiser with the soft-focus effect of a blurring balm and the youth-giving glow of a highlighter. Unlike chemical SPFs that can irritate\u00a0skin, its\u00a0harnesses titanium dioxide, to create a physical shield between your skin and the damaging effects of sun and pollutants. It's also a brilliant buy for darker skin tones as\u00a0\u00a0its packed with niacinamide, a skin-brightener that helps to halt hyper-pigmentation. As for the texture, it's chiffon-light so can be worn under or even over foundation. Angry red blemishes can often take a long time to appease, and while it's\u00a0tempting to\u00a0squeeze and then cover with concealer, this often aggravates them further. Enter, Corsx Acne Pimple Patch.\u00a0Its name may scream\u00a0novelty, but the science behind it is actually pretty impressive. Based on\u00a0high-tech medical wound care, the breathable hydrocolloid, skin-like bandages conceals the spot to create an effective barrier and\u00a0prevent further infection. \u00a0It's also\u00a0\u00a0infused with active ingredients that swiftly heal, drain and minimise the risk of\u00a0\u00a0discolouration and scarring. Pores have long been the\u00a0b\u00eate noire of beauty, but Skinmiso\u00a0is set to change all that. The brand's hero products\u00a0include\u00a0a\u00a0serum that acts in the same way as a corset\u00a0to tighten and shrink, while\u00a0the\u00a0Real Clean Peeling Gel gives\u00a0pores a deep cleanse to prevent further enlargement. CC creams have earned a rapturous\u00a0applause for breaking the beauty mold. They offer\u00a0the\u00a0coverage of concealer with\u00a0the lightness of tinted mosturiser. It's no surprise that a brand is now marketing a\u00a0CCC Cream. The third\u00a0C signifies the addition of\u00a0skin 'conditioning' agents that shield\u00a0skin from environmental aggressors and reverse signs of ageing. Cle Cosmetics CCC Cream is\u00a0available in five shades. Impressively,\u00a0each shade is packed with adaptable pigments that subtly shift to\u00a0offer a truly bespoke base, so whether you're Tilda Swinton or Lupita N'yongo this small wardrobe of shades will still camouflage any imperfections. Do you sigh when you\u00a0catch your shiny complexion\u00a0in the mirror at 3pm?\u00a0Then\u00a0you'll want to add this new-age polish from ORG\u00a0into your morning routine. It might be\u00a0unassuming after you've\u00a0first sprayed it, but you as to start to rub the formula in, the\u00a0action causes the formula to \u2018pill\u2019, gathering all the dead skin, oil and dirt into little balls that drop off into the sink. The process is\u00a0unbelievably satisfying, but it's the results that will really blow you away. Skin is left totally renewed. It's brighter with a soft uniform surface that is ready for your morning make-up. After one use, you'll find\u00a0your\u00a0foundation no longer slides off\u00a0around oily zones, and\u00a0dry flecks will no longer show\u00a0up across your forehead. ",
