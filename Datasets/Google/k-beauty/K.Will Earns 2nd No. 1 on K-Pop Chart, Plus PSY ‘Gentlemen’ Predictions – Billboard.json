    "text": "The \"Gangnam Style\" star's new video is already a YouTube hit. By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJeff Benjamin Despite much of the world focused on K-pop\u2019s reigning king, PSY, the Billboard Korea K-Pop Hot 100 chart, which is refreshed every Thursday, has yet to feel his impact after his single was released the day after. Known as a representative for male vocals, K.Will is No. 1 with new single \u201cLove Blossom.\u201d He had earned a previous No. 1 when his emotional ballad \u201cPlease Don\u2019t\u201d topped in November. The latest track showcases a more Michael Buble-style of singing with a funky, soul-inspired sound paired with top-notch vocals. The song nicely fits with the feel-good sounds of spring, heard in charming tracks like No. 1 K-Pop Hot 100 hit Busker Busker\u2019s \u201cCherry Blossom Ending.\u201d Related\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBTS' V Drops Two Very Different Remixes of 'Slow Dancing' Solo Single\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t04/15/2013\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tExplore\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tExplore\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee latest videos, charts and news\n\n\n\nSee latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news  Hong Dae Kwang, a Top 4 contestant on Korean singing competition \u201cSuperstar K4,\u201d who has captured viewer attention with a rich artistic identity, has pre-released a track off his first EP, \u201cGoodbye.\u201d The track features Soyou of mega girl group SISTAR. The acoustic ballad, co-composed and -arranged by Hong, enters at No. 8 this week. The song is based on the artist\u2019s own love story to which he adds depth with his serene vocal delivery on lyrics such as, \u201cGoodbye my sky, goodbye my smile, goodbye to your scent.\u201d Hong\u2019s debut EP, said to feature a diverse range of genres, is set for release on April 19.  Hip-hop duo Lil Boi and Louie, called GEEKS, makes a huge debut this week at No. 5 with their latest \u201cHow About,\u201d featuring male R&B singer Hareem. The song was written by GEEKS with a help from Kim Do Hoon, who crafted one of the Color of K-pop tracks \u201cMermaid Princess\u201d sung by After School\u2019s Lizzy, KARA\u2019s Jiyoung, 4minute\u2019s Gayoon, SISTAR\u2019s Bora, and Secret\u2019s Sunhwa. The song\u2019s head-bopping beat mixed with lyrics including, \u201cI thought you were the only one for me, but that changed,\u201d showcases a new side of the duo for listeners who recall their first single, \u201cOfficially Missing You,\u201d featuring SISTAR\u2019s Soyou, that was a mainstay in the Top 10 for many weeks.  Despite PSY\u2019s unusual release schedule for \u201cGentleman\u201d with a Friday morning digital release and its music video revealed on Saturday night in Korea, rather than the usual all-in-one rollout from K-pop stars for maximum impact on debut, it looks likely for PSY to own this week\u2019s K-Pop Hot 100.  Upon its release, PSY\u2019s \u201cGentleman\u201d has been at the top of digital retail charts with a No. 1 debut looking likely. PSY\u2019s Happening concert and press conference on Saturday in Seoul, with over 50,000 attendees, has been covered extensively in the domestic and international media. Even before the viral video craze of \u201cGangnam Style\u201d translated overseas, the single was already topping the K-Pop Hot 100 beginning a five-week run. Billboard Korea estimates that it is likely he will rule for at least one week with \u201cGentleman.\u201d Check back on Thursday morning when the K-Pop Hot 100, as well as the rest of Billboard\u2019s charts, are refreshed to see if PSY earned another No. 1.
