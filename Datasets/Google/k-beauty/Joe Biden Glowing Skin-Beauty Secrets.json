    "text": "Yesterday, Vice President Joe Biden virtually stopped by Rachael Ray's talk show so the host could pose a question she's been burning to ask for a while: Ray: \"You have the most glowing, perfect skin of any person I've ever seen. I really want to know what moisturizer you use. I love moisturizers!\" Biden: \"On Jill's instructions, about five years ago, she said I should use Clinique and there's a men's Clinique that has an SPF 20. She was worried about my face, so I do whatever Jill tells me.\" Amazing. Though we hadn't really noticed the stunning sheen of Biden's visage before Ray called attention to it, we're impressed. Plus, we too swear by Clinique's moisturizer; face soulmates! Shine on, Joe, shine on. Sally is the Editor-in-Chief of InStyle. Prieviously, she was the Editor-in-Chief of Marie Claire.
