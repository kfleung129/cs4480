South Korea\u2019s beauty game is top notch. In recent years, K-beauty has become so mainstream stateside that even our drugstores have robust sections for it. But for all the essences and ampoules, sleeping packs and cushion compacts, getting your hands on some real (and not inspired!) South Korean makeup is harder than it looks. And you need the real deal if you\u2019re going to accomplish the popsicle-perfect stained lips of Pony or any of the other Korean makeup influencers on Instagram. You\u2019ve been seeing them too, right? K-beauty lip tint swatches make up about a third of my explore page, tied with pictures of food and jewelry I can\u2019t afford. It turns out, \u2018lip tint\u2019 is about as catch-all a phrase as \u2018lipstick\u2019: some lip tints are matte, some are shiny, some are meant to be buffed out, and some leave a stain that lasts all day. Ahead, I tried out dozens of lip tints to find your perfect match. Tint Type: comfort matte ShadesAvailable: 6 Wear: a couple hours Arguably the lip tint that started it all! For whatever reason, I was surprised to discover that under the Baby Bottle Pop-looking cap there was actually a stout doe foot. You can use it to scoop some of the incredibly light, liquid powder-y formula onto the back of your hand (it won\u2019t stain), and from there apply it to your lips with a fluffy brush in tiny circles. It\u2019s the best way to get an even, blurred coat all over. To copy the popsicle lips popular in Korea, after sweeping a thin coat of Airy Velvet to the edges of your lips, go back in dab a more concentrated layer in the center of your mouth. The finish is matte without cracking, but I did find my lips got a little dry after an hour of wear. Tint type:\u00a0stain Shades Available:\u00a04 Wear:\u00a0till noonIn a more literal world, you\u2019d be able to pull Etude House\u2019s little plastic popsicle right out of its shell. Instead, here\u2019s what happens: the little handle twists out, and inside is a sheer lip stain with a doe foot applicator.\u00a0This stain is traditional in every way: it\u2019s sheer, long-lasting, but also feels slightly drying on lips and comes with a bitter aftertaste.\u00a0But if you\u2019re already a fan of Benetint, the Popsicle Tint offers a similar formula in more shades\u2014the lightest, Apricot Red, is a barely-there peach on fair skin tones, while Oink Red is a good option for those looking for something less cool-toned than the Benefit version. Tint Type: stain Shades Available: 4 Wear: till noon For all intents and purposes, let\u2019s call it a stain because it\u2019s a sheer, longwear liquid lip that leaves you a healthy pink glow (as a treat!) when it mostly wears off. It also dries like a stain, by which I mean close to the lips and not at all sticky. But it does have a little bit of shine on its own that other stains simply don\u2019t. It\u2019s almost like a lip lamination\u2014picture a thin veil of plastic wrap rather than the dimensional, plush shine you\u2019d get from something goopier. The final effect is the closest I got to matching the K-beauty lips on Instagram, thanks to a combo of the finish and blendability. The feel of a stain, with the shine of a gloss: this lip tint belongs in a category all its own. Tint type: balm stain Shades Available: 8 Wear: all day, baby Balm. Stain. Balm stain! Why didn\u2019t anyone think of this before?! True to form, Holika Holika\u2019s Water Drop Tint Bomb comes in a raindrop-shaped stick applicator\u2014the tapered top helps for applying it precisely along the cupid\u2019s bow and the corners of your lips. It goes on smooth and feels moisturizing, and then\u2026 you can\u2019t wipe it off! The color of your lips doesn\u2019t change from the first application to 10 AM, to after lunch, to after work. Once, I applied this before going to bed, and I woke up with pink lips and clean white sheets. If you\u2019re looking for a tinted balm that lasts, this is the only answer. Tint Type: stain Shades Available: 1 Wear: till noon This tint takes the cake for the easiest to apply, that\u2019s for sure. The little ball on top is actually a felt-tip applicator, and because it\u2019s a ball and not a point, it\u2019ll never get bent out of shape or dulled. The round edges also ensure soft yet precise application\u2014trace it along your lips like a liner, and then color everything in. The formula is liquidy enough to spread well all over large areas. All in all, an excellent stain! The one drawback is the shade range: there\u2019s only one color, to be exact, and it\u2019s a bright orangey-red. If that\u2019s not your style, carry on! Tint Type: comfort matte Shades Available: 4 Wear: a couple hours Maybe you\u2019ve seen this type of puff applicator before (Chanel\u2019s Rouge Allure Liquid Powder\u00a0uses it, as does its drugstore dupe\u00a0Nyx Powder Puff Lip Cream)\u2014heck, maybe you\u2019ve even tried it out! If you have, you know that the diffuser sponge allows for super soft blurred lip line, so you don\u2019t need an extra brush for application. I\u2019m calling it a comfort matte, because the formula is thick and fluffy, unlike other liquid mattes you might be familiar with. And the final result is beautiful!\u00a0I\u2019d say this lip tint falls squarely in the same category as other similar products\u2014it\u2019s slightly cheaper ($6 less) than the Chanel, with comparable staying power and about half as few shades. Tint Type: stain Shades Available: 5 Wear: all day, baby Yes, Chateau Labiotte is a Korean makeup brand moonlighting as a fake French winery. And yes, the result is the cutest makeup vessel I\u2019ve ever seen\u2014a bizarrely lifelike wine bottle for ants. But this is also the perfect lip tint. This tint looks and lasts like a traditional stain, but doesn\u2019t have that bitter taste or drying, astringent feel typical in other products. It\u2019s also easy to apply: the sheer formula takes its time to dry down, so you can blend outwards for a popsicle look or fix any spots out of bounds. (You can even dab the doe-foot applicator along your cheeks for a flush that lasts.) It didn\u2019t grab on to my dry spots in a gross looking way. And, OK, have you seen the packaging?! The shade Merlot Burgundy RD03, a translucent stunner somewhere between plum and brick, is the one to grab. Ali Oshinsky is a writer and licensed esthetician based in New York. She spends a lot of time thinking about high-tech skincare (ingredients! tools!) and what John Mayer\u2018s makeup stash might look like (eyeshadow?). Probably has six lip products at the bottom of her bag at any one time, but if you asked her she\u2019d say they\u2019re all lost. email: Amazon Is Having a Major Beauty Sale Right Now Why Matrix Could Be the Next Best Skin Treatment Claudia Sulewski Launches CYKLAR First Class Beauty 2023 The 14 Best Expert-Approved Setting Sprays Austin Butler Doesn\u2019t Think He\u2019s a Beauty Icon Jelly Nails Are Back and Better Than Ever The Best Spring 2024 Beauty Trends to Try Now Add These K-Beauty Prime Day Deals to Your Cart The 20 Best Pore Minimizers for Baby-Smooth Skin Laneige\u2019s Lip Sleeping Mask is on Sale Again Hailey's Go-to Skin Tool Is on Sale for Prime Day!
