    "text": "2016 was contouring, 2017 was boy-brows, and 2018 has been without a doubt the year of highlighter. The so-called faux glow is not only a must in every makeup bag, but also the trend all of us dewy-finish lovers were waiting for and definitely a godsend. If\u00a0you\u2019re new to it, you need to know it\u2019s not only about the product and formula but also the technique. A little touch of perfectly placed highlighter can do wonders on your face, as this multitasking product\u00a0adds glow to your skin while helping you look more awake and bright in matter of seconds. But before we jump into our actual favs, if you\u2019re a newbie, there are a few tips that can help you use a highlighter the right way, starting from where to apply it. There are seven key spots: the inner corner of your eye, the bridge of your nose, under the brow bone, diagonal along the cheekbone, on the center of the apple of the cheek, the very center of your eyelid, and your cupid\u2019s bow. Once you apply some highlighter to any of these, believe me, your makeup game will change forever. Wondering which K-beauty highlighters should be on your get-them-immediately list? Here\u00a0are our absolute favorites! CVS It\u2019s all there in the name, to be honest. This Peripera cushion highlighter is so lightweight it can be the perfect choice for those just starting their highlighter journey. Its super creamy formula doesn\u2019t feel or look cakey and lasts F-O-R-E-V-E-R. Just pat or swab and dab over the spot you want highlighted, and job done! Missha US The Missha Strobeam Starter highlighter is also on the creamy side. Its super smooth texture feels like a moisturizer more than a highlighter, but oh-the-glow it\u2019ll provide you with. It not only works as a light magnet, but also gives your skin a natural glow, reason why it\u2019s an amazing option for no-makeup days. Just apply a small amount to your hands and spread it evenly across your skin. Sephora Kaja is stepping up the makeup game this year, and their highlighters are no exception. Kaja\u2019s Mochi Glow Highlight, a\u00a0compact cream-to-powder highlighter,\u00a0is an easy yet powerful way to add intense glow to your skin\u00a0while still keeping it natural. It feels like a cream at first but finishes like a powder, a great deal for those who prefer a matte kind of look. Innisfree US The very first time I saw this highlighter in action I actually thought it was an oil, because it\u2019s so extremely glowy you can\u2019t believe it\u2019s just all highlighter\u2026 but it is. This super creamy highlighter from Innisfree\u00a0is formulated with translucent micro-pearls that not only reflect every single light around you, but also bring back the\u00a0healthy glow to your face so it looks brighter and younger. VDL US As if VDL wasn\u2019t already providing us with all the glow thanks to their luminous primers, the brand also carries Lumilayer All Over Stick, a moisturizing highlight stick that can truly turn a three-hours-of-sleep face into a good night\u2019s rest. It brings a luminous sheen while energizing fatigued skin, so it\u2019s kind of like a 2-in-1. Too Cool For School US Now, let\u2019s talk fun highlighters. Too Cool For School\u2019s Artclass\u00a0is a very luminous balm palette that carries three different shades of highlight \u2014 pink, green, and purple \u2014 all for different purposes: volume, gloss, and tone up glow. The best part is you can layer one on top of the other one in order to play with different lights, all to accomplish the ultimate dewy-look. Club Clio US I like to call\u00a0the Clio Art Highlighter \u201cthe powder highlighter for those who don\u2019t like powder highlighters.\u201d Its oven-baked formula provides the skin with a hint of shimmer and spark that adheres to the skin for hours, keeping it luminous all day long. It\u2019s a super lightweight and very silky formula that feels gentle on the skin and doesn\u2019t cake throughout the day. Hermo.my The Son & Park Cube Highlighter is an all-time favorite and with good reasons. This little cube contains an iridescent and creamy highlighter that makes your skin look radiant, being the perfect example of \u201ca little bit goes a long way.\u201d Just a drop of this highlighter will give you so much glow you won\u2019t believe it all came from this tiny bottle. Dab with your fingers for a subtle yet radiant glow, and voil\u00e1! Are you ready to shine bright like a diamond all season long, Soompiers?
