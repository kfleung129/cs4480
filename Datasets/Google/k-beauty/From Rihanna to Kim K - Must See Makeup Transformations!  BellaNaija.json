From creating cleavage and making our noses slimmer to changing whole face shapes, makeup his the new plastic surgery. For Filipino TV\u00a0host\u00a0Paolo Ballesteros,\u00a0makeup\u00a0is more than concealing a few dark spots and looking good \u2013 it\u2019s changing his face to look like some our favourite celebrities. From Kim Kardashian,\u00a0Nicki Minaj\u00a0and Ariana Grande to Megan Fox, Katy Perry & Miley Cyrus, Paolo has re-created famous faces almost to perfection. He uses just makeup, coloured contacts, wigs and we have to admit some of them made us gasp and giggle and he definitely won\u2019t have a problem going for Halloween. You can see more of his work on his Instagram page: @pochoy_29, but first check out some of our favourite transformations.
