Unlike traditional eye cream, the Perfecting Eye Cream for Face, from Korean skincare brand AHC, is designed to be applied all over the face, not just under and over the eyes. Said to be owned by almost all Korean women, it claims to hydrate, brighten and tighten skin, and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, making skin appear youthful and radiant. And it's good news for Australian skincare enthusiasts, because the cream has just launched exclusively at Myer for $49. The Perfecting Eye Cream from Korean skincare brand AHC (pictured left and right) is so popular, it sells once every three seconds in Korea To achieve the best results around the eyes, the cream should be lightly dabbed onto the under-eye area and over the eyelid after skin has been primed with toner. When applying the product all over the face, it should be used as the last step in your skincare routine and gently dabbed evenly across the forehead, cheeks and chin. Korean beauty products have become all the rage in recent years, thanks to widespread endorsements from major stars and influencers. Australian TV presenter\u00a0Ksenija Lukich was recently announced as the latest brand ambassador\u00a0for AHC, while celebrity fans of the brand include Hollywood actress Anne Hathaway, who reportedly swears by the best-selling eye cream.
