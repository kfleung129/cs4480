Editor / October 11 2022 Many K-Beauty products have A+ reputations, particularly when it comes to skin care. The country has a knack for combining interesting ingredients with quirky textures and unconventional methods made to help us glow. From 10-step routines to jello skin, there\u2019s always a new Korean beauty trend to try. But if you\u2019re stuck knowing where to start (there's a lot of K-Beauty skin care in Australia now), that\u2019s where our panel of experts comes in. Our lineup of pros spend day in and day out testing the latest and greatest beauty has to offer. So you can take their word as bible that these are the best K-beauty products they\u2019ve come across\u2026 @delaneyloane Innisfree Aloe Revital Sleeping Pack \u201cMy reactive skin type never let me get in on the 10-step K-Beauty action, so instead I turned to a sole formula (also hailing from Korea) that does the work of several hydrating steps in one hit. Said wunderkid? This soothing aloe sleeping mask. I apply (alarmingly generously) on the dreaded \u2018my skin is physically hurting\u2019 nights (AKA after one too many days of wearing/applying a full face of makeup have been strung together). It takes away the sting of a broken-down barrier, feels like a cooling dream going on and manages to get everything back on track by morning.\u201d $20 at Sephora Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask in 'Gummy Bear' @aja_rose \"Come winter, my lips are as dry as the Sahara Desert. Dramatic? Maybe. But the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask is a must-have in my skin care rotation for good reason. With added vitamin C, coconut oil and shea butter, the formula has been designed to keep lips hydrated, all while you catch up on that important beauty sleep. Come morning, it\u2019s as though my lips have just had a big drink of water. They feel (and look) plump, smooth, and healed. With one sold every three seconds worldwide, it\u2019s a firm K-Beauty favourite.\u201d $31 at Adore Beauty @kimkpham Purito Centella Green Level Buffet Serum \u201cThe best K-Beauty product hands down is the Laniege Sleeping Lip Mask. But a sneaky second-place contender and an unsung hero in my beauty routine is the Purito Centella Green Level Buffet Serum. Every time I use this, I notice the biggest difference in hydration and fading of redness in my skin. Scars heal a lot faster too, especially from acne.\u201d $32 at lilabeauty.com.au @rubycotton AMOREPACIFIC Treatment Cleansing Oil \"The first time I ever purchased this cleanser in MECCA, the shop attendant gave it to me straight: \u201cit\u2019s a splurge, but you won\u2019t regret it.\u201d Four years and at least 12 bottles later, she\u2019s completely right. Though the product has undergone one small packaging change and a minor tweak to the name, the formula has remained the same: gentle, hydrating and damn effective at removing any and all makeup. Don\u2019t be discouraged by the fact that it\u2019s an oil, either. As an acne-prone girl myself, this lightweight cleanser only ever leaves my skin clean, glowing and smooth.\" $75 at MECCA @neehaaa_ COSRX\u00a0Advanced\u00a0Snail\u00a096\u00a0Mucin\u00a0Power\u00a0Essence \u201cMy ultimate favourite K-Beauty product has to be the COSRX Snail Mucin Essence. If you\u2019re looking for a top-tier hydrator, you have to check this product out! I love using this alone or mixed with my moisturiser to release a new level of hydration and overall glow. This bottle of magic is not only amazing for hydration but also assists in repairing the skin barrier and overall skin texture. The perfect addition to anyone\u2019s Winter skincare routine!\"\u00a0$38 at Adore Beauty @briarclark Sulwhasoo Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream \u201cI\u2019ve been obsessed with K-Beauty skin care for a few years now and currently the Sulwhasoo Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream has my full attention. This lightweight, silky face cream is infused with a revolutionary and deeply penetrative form of ginseng that boosts skin resilience to promote firmer skin and minimise the appearance of wrinkles. Sulwhasoo is the K-Beauty equivalent of La Mer, and the luxurious feel and herbaceous scent of this stuff is enough to mentally transport you to the relaxing atmosphere of a Korean day spa. Heaven.\u201d $359 at Sephora @diandramalivindi Then I Met You Living Cleansing Balm \u201cK-Beauty is *full* of must-have products, but a go-to for me has to be Then I Met You\u2019s Living Cleansing Balm. Perfect for when I need a deeper clean, the canary yellow balm turns into a silky oil when emulsified to melt away any unwanted makeup or build-up \u2014 and yes, it even works on my most persistent mascaras. Made with vitamin E and olive oil, it leaves my skin feeling super hydrated and soft after a cleanse, which is a must for me!\u201d $73.26 at Cult Beauty Loved this article?
