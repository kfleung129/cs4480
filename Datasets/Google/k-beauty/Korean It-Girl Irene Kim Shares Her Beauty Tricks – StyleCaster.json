Photographers couldn\u2019t get enough her, editors were clamoring to find out who she was, and now major\u00a0brands are taking notice: The Seattle native\u00a0was recently named\u00a0Est\u00e9e Lauder\u2019s Global Beauty Contributor, meaning she\u2019ll impart her modern take on makeup and her social media savvy to one of the most esteemed brands on the planet. But how does Kim\u2014who\u2019s amassed over 600,000 Instagram followers\u2014stay on top of her\u00a0hair and makeup\u00a0game? The 27-year-old had plenty of wisdom to share about how she keeps her skin on-point during long (we\u2019re talking\u00a024-hours-long) flights around the globe, or what she reaches for when\u00a0cruising the K-beauty aisles.

Which products do you have to use to start your day?\nToday\u2019s a long day, so I made sure my skin was very moisturized and prepped, and my makeup stays on as long as possible\u2014I\u2019m so dehydrated from being on the plane. So, I did a double micro-essence thing where I [used]\u00a0the toner ($95) and then I did the micro-essence mask ($67), which I\u2019m obsessed with now, but I put it in the fridge, then put it on a cream, and then I put on sunblock. Sunblock is so important to me. I use\u00a0Crescent White ($50). You travel so frequently \u2013 do you ever dare to whip out a full beauty treatment on the plane?\nI do. I\u2019m always piling on moisturizer on top of more moisturizer. And then I always carry face mist or toner. Do you just apply it in your seat, and go for it?\nSometimes! I use anything really soothing on my face on the plane, and there is something about the water in the bathroom that I don\u2019t want to use, so I\u2019ll ask for water and like I\u2019ll carry cotton swabs and I\u2019ll wipe my face with that water. And then I\u2019ll do a cream mask so it\u2019s not so obvious.  With all that traveling, how do you keep your skin in check?\nI still do break out a bit here [points to her chin] and I think it\u2019s just, I have to wait it out and make sure I don\u2019t pick at it, because it\u2019s very tempting. Sometimes after a hot shower, you know how the shower steams up, I\u2019ll take a cotton swab and soak it in toner \u2013 like my rose water one or a face mist \u2013 and I\u2019ll just place it on the break out area. I feel like that helps to soothe it down a bit.

You just went shorter for Fashion Week, right?\nI did! I wanted a little bit of a change and then I went for cooler tones.  It\u2019s been a whole lot of different colors at this point.\nRight?! Yeah, I didn\u2019t know that I was going to end up shocking people with my hair. It was very organic\u2014but it\u2019s kind of made me Irene, whatever that means! It\u2019s been my signature\u2014I\u2019ve had it for three\u00a0years now\u2014and it\u2019s fun to change it. Do you have any tricks to maintain the health of your hair?\nI usually work with my hairstylist in Korea. I\u2019m just like his doll, his living doll. Every two\u00a0weeks I\u2019ll go in for a retouch and if I\u2019m super busy or have to wash my hair more, I\u2019ll go in sooner. He also gives me hair treatments at the salon that help keep up the strength and I actually don\u2019t use hair oil or conditioner, I just use moisturizer. I feel like you know, whatever you put on your face is good for your hair, right? As long as it doesn\u2019t get too greasy. So you actually just use your face moisturizer in your hair?\nYeah, I\u2019ll take any of the leftovers and put it right into my hair. Because some of the hair oils I think are too strong, and sometimes you get breakouts from them. I feel like that causes breakouts \u2013 and shampoos and things \u2013 so I stick to what I put on my face for my hair.

What are your favorite brands right now?\nI really like Innisfree for skin care because they have very good products for sensitive skin and it\u2019s not overly scented at all. I don\u2019t really like things that have too powerful of a smell, I just feel like it could be irritating to the skin. Etude House has great lip colors and lip tints, Tony Moly has great lip stuff too and eyeliner and things like that. Oh, and Skin Food! They have tons of products that smell really fruity and edible, like their sugar mask. Do you think the fun and quirkiness of Korean beauty packaging will trickle down\u00a0to other markets?\nI think it should. With all the social media, and all the different platforms, if your product is very cute and pops, you want to take a picture \u2013 it just looks really fun. And lastly, heading into Fashion Month, do you do anything to gear up for the back-to-back events, health-wise? Any weird tricks up your sleeve to keep you healthy all the way through?\nBefore I travel I head to the gym every day just to keep up the balance of my body. Not to lose weight, but just to keep up my energy. I try to have a healthy balanced diet too, I have lots of fish and vegetables and I try to hydrate as much as possible and sleep as much as possible. And actually, my agent prepared this for me before I came here \u2013 it\u2019s like red ginseng extract, so it\u2019s an energy booster to take when you\u2019re tired!
