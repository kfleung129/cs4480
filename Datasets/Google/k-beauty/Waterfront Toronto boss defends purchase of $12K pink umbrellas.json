Waterfront Toronto CEO and president John Campbell fires back after Toronto councillor Denzil Minnan-Wong criticizes pink umbrellas and rocks on Sugar Beach. This article is over a year old, and the information within may be out of date. sugar_beach The 36 pink umbrellas on Sugar Beach were purchased for $12,000 each, something Councillor Denzil Minnan-Wong is criticizing as a waste of taxpayers' money.   In the face of a city councillor\u2019s criticism, the head of Waterfront Toronto says spending close to $1 million to buy two giant rocks and 36 pink umbrellas for Sugar Beach was a prudent investment. \u201cWhat\u2019s the big picture? Some people just can\u2019t see the forest through the trees,\u201d Waterfront Toronto president and CEO John Campbell said Thursday.  \u201cIt\u2019s all about building a better city. Yes, you can pick a light pole here, an umbrella there, that\u2019s really not the point. The point is we are delivering on our mandate to provide a great community . . . this is about revitalization.\u201d Parks and a public space such as Sugar Beach have helped lure development to Toronto\u2019s waterfront, he added. Tax revenues generated from waterfront revitalization and the $2.6 billion investment from developers have effectively paid back to the federal, provincial and city governments almost all of the $1.5 billion they provided to Waterfront Toronto, he said. Councillor Denzil Minnan-Wong is accusing Waterfront Toronto of wasting tax dollars when it paid $500,000 to purchase two \u201cdesigner rocks\u201d and about $12,000 each for three dozen pink umbrellas, \u201cthat look like they\u2019re wearing out.\u201d The waterfront park on Queens Quay opened in 2010, but Minnan-Wong said he only just obtained the invoices, which he said he had to \u201crip out\u201d of the agency. \u201cI get mad when we can\u2019t improve parkland deficient areas and our tax dollars are being used to buy two rocks and a bunch of umbrellas for close to a million bucks,\u201d Minnan-Wong said Thursday. \u201cWe should be making it look nice, but it\u2019s a question of value and it\u2019s a question of transparency,\u201d he said. Campbell noted the umbrellas are not the kind you take to the beach. They are permanent \u201cart structures\u201d equipped with LED lights and designed to withstand the weather for decades. The rocks, which feature coloured stripes \u2014 in keeping with the park\u2019s sugar theme \u2014 were chosen by the firm that won an international design competition \u201cthat was public,\u201d Campbell said. He rejected Minnan-Wong\u2019s suggestion the umbrellas need replacing. Next week, the city\u2019s executive committee will consider a report on the next phase of waterfront revitalization. The agency, established in 2003, is running out of money and is looking for additional funding for flood protection and transit, as well as asking the city for more borrowing powers for new projects, Campbell said. Minnan-Wong, who sits on the committee, calls Waterfront Toronto \u201can expensive organization with lots of people with high-priced salaries and they\u2019re anything but transparent.\u201d Campbell dismissed that as nonsense and invited the public to check out information posted on Waterfront Toronto\u2019s website.
