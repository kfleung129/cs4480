    "text": "If you\u2019re a skincare fanatic like me, you\u2019d know about the massive, seasonal sales in Seoul. And if, like me, you\u00a0used\u00a0to do a yearly girls\u2019 trip\u00a0there\u00a0with an empty suitcase,\u00a0only to return with it absolutely stuffed with skincare\u00a0and K-beauty steals. And if, like me,\u00a0you\u2019re\u00a0currently missing the head-to-toe Korean spa\u00a0experiences?\u00a0Well,\u00a0you\u2019re in the right place: Introducing the\u00a0Phymongshe\u00a0treatments at Luxus. Luxus will be opening\u00a0a new outlet\u00a0in Central soon,\u00a0but\u00a0as of now, the two outlets you can\u00a0enjoy\u00a0is\u00a0in\u00a0Wan Chai or\u00a0Parkview estate\u00a0where I visited. I know, I know\u00a0\u2014 having gone\u00a0for\u00a0multiple playdates there in my youth, I had no idea the location housed a whole\u00a0spa\u00a0by the entrance.\u00a0The things you learn as adults\u2026 There\u2019s something about entering a wellness\u00a0space that invokes calm: the soothing, tinkling background music, the soft shades of timber, the beautifully\u00a0curated products on display. It\u2019s a monthly ritual that I always look forward to, and this time was no different. Luxus\u00a0at Parkview is a massive space that\u00a0offers a full range of treatments from\u00a0body\u00a0or\u00a0foot massages, skin-glowing facials, nail\u00a0care, and even\u00a0scalp treatments\u00a0\u2014 one that\u00a0I\u2019ve realized I need to do quite regularly to stave off greasy roots; but I digress,\u00a0we\u2019re here for a facial. And it\u2019s one that I\u2019ve been excited for ever since learning about\u00a0Phymongshe, a Korean spa brand that launched for the first time in Hong Kong via Luxus. Couples and best friends alike will be delighted to know that double-treatment rooms\u00a0are\u00a0available here;\u00a0excellent for a\u00a0spa date to relax and recuperate, while also enjoying a good natter with your pal. Phymongshe\u00a0is a highly focused Korean skincare brand that seeks to develop treatments to enhance the skin and body. With a philosophy of\u00a0highlighting\u00a0\u201cgenuine beauty\u201d through a more mindful life, their branding is aesthetically gorgeous (just look at it!) and mindfully formulated. The range is free of parabens, synthetic fragrances and artificial colourants, ensuring a\u00a0treatment experience with minimal irritants. After a quick chat with the on-site beautician, we determined that, for my slightly dry and dehydrated skin, the\u00a0Water Blossom Hydrating Facial (HK$1180\u00a0/ 60 min) would be\u00a0most suitable\u00a0for me. For the curious, Luxus also offers an Express Facial (HK$680 / 30 min), a Mindful Moment Signature Treatment (HK$1,980 / 90 min) and various other treatments under the Phymongshe line. The\u00a0rituals of a professional facial are no revelation. However, I need to gush over the\u00a0gorgeous, delicate floral aroma of the products throughout the session\u00a0\u2014 so soothing, especially with the soft tunes in the background, that I was lulled into\u00a0almost a sleep-like state. What more could one hope for\u00a0out of a\u00a0treat\u00a0yo\u2019self\u00a0afternoon? With how fast-paced life in the city is, it can be hard to justify putting time away for a little self-care, but, in all honesty, a facial should really be everyone\u2019s monthly staple\u00a0at the\u00a0very\u00a0least. If I had more time, I would go weekly if I could! Perhaps my skin was in desperate need of some pampering;\u00a0the changing of seasons certainly didn\u2019t help, either.\u00a0Ultimately, it was apparent after coming the treatment that my skin was\u00a0aglow with the tell-tale Korean \u2018chok-chok\u2019 aura. The radiant, bouncy skin of K-Pop starlets. I felt renewed, and my skin looked\u00a0better than it has in weeks. There\u2019s something to be said about the\u00a0Phymongshe\u00a0product line, too. For all the buzzwords that the beautician threw at me, the\u00a0product\u00a0line genuinely was as light\u00a0and\u00a0effective as they say.\u00a0Would I recommend this treatment to my friends? Absolutely. The Water Blossom Hydrating Facial is priced at HK$1,180 with a 40% discount for first-timers\u00a0trying a\u00a0Phymongshe\u00a0treatment\u00a0at Luxus.
