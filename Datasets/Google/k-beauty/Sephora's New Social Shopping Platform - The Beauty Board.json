If you love all things beauty on Pinterest, chances are you've encountered the infuriating situation in which you love a makeup look but have no inkling as to which exact products are needed to recreate it. Leave it to Sephora to give us a solution to that issue. The cosmetics retailing giant launched Beauty Board this morning, a new Pinterest-esque social platform that allows users to upload pictures of their own makeup looks\u2014with the option to shop the look. In other words, if you really love how a shade of eyeshadow looks on a user, you can immediately add the exact product to your virtual shopping cart. And on the flipside, if you've been thinking about a product or color but aren't sure what it really looks like, you don't have to rely on picture reviews (or Google)\u2014just search the Beauty Board, and you'll have your answer (and inspiration!) in no time. Users who've uploaded the looks can leave product reviews as well. Of course, it's not just a tool for gawking at pics\u2014users can \"like\" a look or leave comments. So if you're wondering how well you're pulling off that orange lipstick, just snap a picture, upload to The Beauty Board, and get instant global feedback. In a way, it's like Sephora just gave its customers the opportunity to all be beauty bloggers. Maybe you'll log on just to post a review, and end up inspiring thousands of people to try your look.
