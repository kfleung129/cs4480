The 2018 Winter Olympic Games commence this Friday in Pyeongchang, South Korea, so what better time to take a look at one of the hosting country\u2019s most renowned exports: beauty and skincare. South Korea is a breeding ground for the latest innovations in beauty, and while only a few Olympic athletes will go home with a medal, we imagine plenty of them will go home with an assortment of sheet masks. This year, everyone\u2019s a winner. This ultra-hydrating Layering Essence contains all the amino acids and nanoparticles your skin needs to reach the greatest level of moisture\u2014 and the packaging is certainly an added plus! The Essence comes in 6 skin benefitting potions: Spot Care, Oily, Soothing, Lifting, Anti-Wrinkle, and, as shown here, Moisturizing. Hyaluronic acid has become the must-have ingredient in skincare for its ultra-hydrating results seemingly overnight. Mizon\u2019s Hyaluronic Acid 100 is a lightweight serum that contains 50% hyaluronic acid, ceramide to help strengthen the skin, and raspberry extract to help protect it against free radical damage. When used in conjunction with your daily moisturizer, not even the cold mountain air will dry out your skin. Yes, good skincare is the key contributor to flawless skin, but on the days that you require a little extra coverage, this foundation-concealer combo is sure to do the trick. The Essential Star-Cealer Foundation from Jungsaemmool is a two-in-one compact with a liquid foundation and a creamy full coverage concealer for a smooth and luminous finish. Frudia harnesses the nourishing properties of pomegranate with this ultra-affordable Pomegranate Nutri-Moisturizing Cream. The rich formula is packed with fatty acids and polyphenols thanks to the 63% natural pomegranate extract and a little goes a long way. Toner is the true MVP of skincare. It rids the skin of any lasting signs of makeup, balances pH levels, helps to prevent breakouts, shrinks your pores, and, all the while, hydrates. Extract It Toner by Huxley is made with over 90% natural ingredients, most notably organic Sahara prickly pear cactus seed extract, which provide next-level hydration and nutrients. By Charlotte Klein By Eve Batey By Bess Levin Vitamin C can sometimes irritate the skin, but that\u2019s something you don\u2019t need to worry about with this 97.2% natural serum. Femmue\u2019s Lumi\u00e9re Vital C is a lightweight and fast-absorbing serum that evens and brightens skintone while also calming and hydrating the skin thanks to ingredients like centella asiatica and hyaluronic acid. Pucker up after using these Peach Slices Aqua Jelly Lip Masks which are infused with nourishing ingredients such as coconut, shea butter, honey, and vitamin C. These will be especially useful for the winter Olympic athletes suffering from dry, chapped lips. Lift, refresh, and brighten the eye area with the Wide Awake Brightening Eye Cream from Saturday Skin. The pale pink, fragrance-free formula is made from palm seed extract and date seed extract for smooth skin and sparkling eyes. Laneige\u2019s BB Cushion Hydra Radiance is the fastest fix for an even, smooth, and dewy complexion. It has broad spectrum SPF 50 to protect the skin from UVA/UVB rays and has double-coated pigments for the ultimate brightening and hydrating effect. Best of all, it\u2019s a two-for-one deal as each compact comes with a full size refill and additional applicator sponge. What would Sunday night in the twenty-first century be without sheet masks? Sad. The Atoclassic Real Tonic Lifting Treatment Mask will truly transform your skin with its blend of antioxidant root extracts and sodium hyaluronate. This mask will leave your skin feeling firmer and healthier than before after leaving it on for just twenty minutes.
