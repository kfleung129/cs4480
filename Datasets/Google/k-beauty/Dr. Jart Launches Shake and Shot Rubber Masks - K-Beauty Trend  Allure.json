    "text": "By Sara Spruch-Feiner Rubber-masking, the Korean beauty ritual once available only in Seoul spas, is getting more accessible \u2014 and fun. Case in point: K-beauty mainstay Dr. Jart+ just launched its Shake & Shot masks, a collection of four \"DIY\" rubber masks sold in movie theater soda-inspired cups with slightly terrifying (or hilarious, depending on how you look it at) baby faces on their lids. The rubber masks work much like the at-home versions we've seen before, but Dr. Jart+ has made the treatments more user-friendly and less messy, thanks to the cup containers. The cup's \"straw,\" is in fact, not a straw at all, but rather a handy spatula used to mix part one, the mask's base, with part two, the targeted ampoule. Unlike other rubber masks, which require you to stir your concoction like a chemist (inevitably splashing formula on yourself in the process), to activate Dr. Jart+'s new masks, you place a finger over the cup's straw hole and shake \u2014 like you're mixing a cocktail. The formula quickly congeals into the rubbery texture you apply to your face. Just remember the masks aren't drip-proof, at least if you're an amateur when it comes to application (like me), but it's worth the dripping for the enjoyable cooling sensation on your face. Once it dries, you peel it off (experts will do so in one full, and extremely satisfying piece) to reveal glowing skin. Choose between hydrating, firming, brightening, or soothing options \u2014 or you know, pick up one of each. Each one-time-use treatment is $12. Below, a bit on each mask, so you can make an informed purchase. The Shake & Shot Brightening Mask utilizes vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and sea buckthorn fruit extract, which is chock full of antioxidants and helps even skin tone, brighten darkness, and revitalize the complexion. The Hydro edition gives skin a shot of emollient, moisturizing vitamin B5 and a Dr. Jart+ special, called \"expert moist complex,\" which is rich in amino acids and said to strengthen the skin barrier. The Firming mask packs a punch with a vitamin A derivative (retinol) and \"Oxyforce Cellular Active,\" Dr. Jart+'s proprietary complex to boost collagen synthesis and skin's elasticity.
