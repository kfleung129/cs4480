Starting today and running through March 26th, the retailer is hosting a pop-up shop featuring over 500 K-beauty products. Seven stores in the US and Canada (see the list here) and the website will carry the K-beauty merchandise. The shop is part of Nordstrom\u2019s \u201cPop-In\u201d initiative, a series of themed pop-up shops. The first three of 2017 have been dubbed \u201cKPOP-In\u201d and focus on Korean brands. The first featured Gentle Monster sunglasses, and the last will focus on Korean fashion. According to Nordstrom, for many of the brands here, this shop will mark their US debut, which is pretty darn exciting if you\u2019re a K-beauty fan or just love things that no one else can get. There are also some more familiar brands, like Too Cool for School and a mask collection curated by Glow Recipe, the K-beauty e-commerce site. Other brands include Sukoo Sukoo, A-Pieu, Cr\u00e8me, DTRT, Huxley, and Hanahzo. Prices range from $10 for makeup purse mirrors to over $80 for serums. You\u2019ll find skincare, makeup, nail polish, little trinkets, and makeup bags. In case you\u2019re a little overwhelmed by the wide selection, here are some intriguing products to toss into your cart: Who doesn\u2019t love a good salt scrub? Plus, this packaging is A+. And soap in the shape of a gem is a no-brainer. Vant\u2019s Facial Purify Mask can be used as a cleanser or a mask. It contains two types of clay plus charcoal and green tea extract. I\u2019ve tried the Huxley serum and it is luxurious and not greasy at all, with a bonus inspirational quote on the bottle: \u201cGreat things never came from comfort zones.\u201d Korean beauty brands are known for their crazy long-wearing lip stain formulas, and this one from TPSY looks promising. You also can\u2019t go to a K-beauty sale without picking up some sheet masks, and this milk carton is adorable.    ",
