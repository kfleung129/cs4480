    "text": "Experts reveal the latest findings from Seoul BEAUTYcrew Beauty Editor / October 28 2021 We think we can all agree that K-Beauty is a global phenomenon at this point. Whether Korean\u2019s are teaching us how to have skin so clear it resembles literal glass or dishing out factoids about unusual yet effective ingredients, (who knew snail mucin had so many skin care benefits?) Korea is just a cut above the rest when it comes to revolutionary beauty finds. And if you thought the K-Beauty train was losing steam, you\u2019d be wrong. The mecca for all things beauty never sleeps when it comes to furthering innovations in the beauty space and we\u2019re forever grateful to our Korean friends for their dedication to their craft.In fact, Seoul-based Lauren Lee, a K-Beauty expert and the founder of Australia\u2019s first online K-Beauty destination Style Story, and Meaghan Payne, the Marketing Manager for the luxury K-Beauty brand Sulwhasoo, both have plenty to share about the country's latest beauty trends and innovations. According to Lee, Korean skin care has been influenced by a global skin concern: maskne. \u201cMasks have been mandatory in Korea since March 2020, and are resulting in symptoms like dryness, redness, irritation and \u2018maskne\u2019,\u201d Lee explains. So just how are our Korean friends dealing with all that maskne, you may ask? Well, it turns out they\u2019re turning to \u2018low-irritation\u2019 cosmetics, \u201cdesigned to soothe angry pores and skin troubles\u201d. Think: Pimple patches and centella-infused skin care, AKA some of our favourite K-Beauty exports. \u201cHydrocolloid pimple patches, as well as those featuring ingredients like ceramides, Centella asiatica (AKA cica/Tiger\u2019s Grass) and mugwort are all popular at the moment, thanks to their skin soothing and anti-inflammatory properties,\u201d says the Style Story founder. We recommend:COSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch; AHC Aqualuronic Serum; and KLAIRS Midnight Blue Calming Sheet Mask. COSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch AHC Aqualuronic Serum KLAIRS Midnight Blue Calming Sheet Mask Along the same sensitive skin-friendly vein, is a shift towards the streamlining of steps.\u201c[It\u2019s about] using fewer products to get the same results,\u201d explains Lee. \u201cA lot of the newer formulations are combining the benefits of several products into one.\u201d Some of her favourite multipurpose finds? \u201cLaneige\u2019s Cream Skin Refiner combines the benefits of a cream in a toner,\u201d she recommends. \u201c[And] Subi\u2019s Brightening Powder Cleanser functions as both an exfoliator and a foam cleanser depending on how much water you use with it.\u201dLee\u2019s own skin care range Jelly Ko also boasts a \u201cBubble Tea Steam Cream [that] has a 3-in-1 formula that replaces oil, serum and moisturiser in your routine.\u201d Laneige\u2019s Cream Skin Refiner Subi\u2019s Brightening Powder Cleanser Jelly Ko Bubble Tea Steam Cream \u201cNot only does this cut down on the steps in your routine, it also contributes to less waste and fewer carbon emissions in transporting products across the globe,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is a key growth area in the industry.\u201d It\u2019s a point that Payne reiterates, telling us that Amore Pacific (Sulwhasoo\u2019s mother company) has committed themselves to providing eco-friendly options for customers that doesn\u2019t just stop with eco-conscious packaging. \u201cEco practices have always been of the utmost importance to Amorepacific and its brands and we are seeing a big focus on this,\u201d she says. \u201cAmorepacific Group has opened the very first Refill Station in the Korean beauty industry\u2026 [it] offers an eco-friendly refill bottle that uses 30 per cent less plastic and invites customers to fill up the bottle with 15 kinds of products including shampoo and body wash, as much as they need.\u201d When it comes to trend-setting albeit unique skin care ingredients, the beauty hub simply can\u2019t be beat. \u201cK-Beauty brands place a lot of emphasis on new ingredients because Korea is a very trend-based market,\u201d explains Lee. Up first for the newcomers to know about is \u2018Yuzu\u2019, otherwise referred to as Yuja in Korea. \u201c[It\u2019s] a type of citrus fruit that\u2019s naturally full of vitamin C,\u201d says Lee \u201cIt\u2019s great for brightening so you\u2019ll see it in a lot of serums targeting dull skin, dark spots and pigmentation.\u201d Korea\u2019s love for centella is still going strong too, says Lee, and is \u201cmore popular than ever because it is perfect for soothing weary, irritated, damaged, red and acne-prone skin.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll find it in everything from face masks, to cleansers, toners, serums, moisturisers and even sleeping masks.\u201d Mugwort, an ingredient typically used in traditional Korean medicine for its \u201csoothing and anti-inflammatory properties,\u201d is also a big winner because \u201cit\u2019s ideal for dry, irritated skin.\u201d As too are probiotics, \u201cwhich are useful to support a healthy microbiome and reduce symptoms of dryness, redness, irritation and inflammation,\u201d says Lee. \u201cLook out for products featuring Lactobacillus ferment lysate, Bifida ferment lysate, Galactomyces ferment filtrate and Saccharomyces ferment filtrate,\u201d to try them for yourself. As for Sulwhasoo, Payne says the brand has turned to ancient Korean medical methodologies, utilising \u201ccutting edge skin science\u201d to study the \u201cefficacy of 3,912 complex herbs, with in-depth research on women\u2019s skins of all ages,\u201d namely the brand\u2019s hero ingredient \u2013 Korean Ginseng \u2013 \u201cand its preservation for anti-ageing efficacy.\u201d \u201cHanbang ingredients are traditional herbal ingredients used in Korean medicines and they\u2019ve long been a staple in Korean life,\u201d she explains. But just what should you be looking for in terms of ingredients? According to Payne herbs such as \u201cginseng root, sacred lotus, and rehmannia [all] boast anti-ageing, anti-inflammation, and regenerative properties.\u201d We recommend: SULWHASOO First Care Activating Serum; DEAR DAHLIA Skin Paradise Tone-Up Sun Cushion; and SULWHASOO Bloomstay Vitalizing Water Lotion. SULWHASOO First Care Activating Serum DEAR DAHLIA Skin Paradise Tone-Up Sun Cushion SULWHASOO Bloomstay Vitalizing Water Lotion Makeup is the last thing on anyone\u2019s minds during a global pandemic, but Korean\u2019s are still finding ways to look polished without a full beat, focusing on the nails and eyes instead. \u201cKoreans are turning to procedures like eyelash extensions, lash tints and lifts to accentuate their eyes, as they are one of the few features you can see from behind a mask,\u201d Lee explains. There\u2019s also \u201ca lot more modern art-inspired abstract nails that are relatively simple in design,\u201d says Lee. \u201c3D nail techniques are also very popular, using different textures to create shapes on the nails.\u201d Image credit: @nail_unistella BRB while we Google how to DIY 3D nails... Meanwhile, over at AmorePacific, the company has been focusing its energy on AI technologies that don\u2019t require face-to-face human interaction, explains Payne. \u201cWe are seeing a shift towards customisation, especially in the AI space, delivering a series of bespoke solutions to optimise the customer experience.\u201d This includes things like personalised lip makeup products, foundations and serums, in an effort to \u201cprovide the best products and services for individual customers.\u201d After the past year and half we\u2019ve had, the entire globe is ready for some escapism. And according to Payne, we\u2019ll likely be seeing a roll-out of \u201cbeauty and skin care products that offer more meditative, soothing, and spa-like moments.\u201d \u201cK-beauty and skin care have to be functional [and] effective, [but also] able to mentally transport you to another headspace,\u201d she explains. \u201cKorea has always been innovative in the beauty space, providing a cure for skin problems by nurturing our customers from inside to outside, and taking care of them as a person through the skin \u2013 a genuine approach that roots from the hanbang spirit.\u201d And perhaps that\u2019s the very reason why we can\u2019t (and won\u2019t ever) get enough of K-Beauty.
