    "text": "TRENDING: Posted by Georgina Caldwell | May 17, 2018 | Asia & Australasia, Finance, Marketing, Products, Retail | AmorePacific-owned luxury beauty brand Hera has opened its first store in Singapore, according to a report published by Pulse News. The K-beauty brand is hoping that the new Singapore location will lead to further stores across Southeast Asia as part of a wider move to expand its global footprint. Hera chose a standalone boutique within the Takashimaya Department Store for its Singapore launch, and has further plans to open a Singapore flagship in the near future before travelling to neighbouring ASEAN markets. The new store will stock prestige skin care and make-up developed to withstand the high humidity and temperatures typical of the region.
