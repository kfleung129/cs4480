    "text": "By Jaime Osnato I don't usually jump on skin-care trends, preferring to sit back and assess whether a new product or treatment is worth my time and hard-earned cash. Oftentimes, the hype fades and the social media frenzy moves onto the next \u201cit\u201d thing. Meanwhile, my money stays in my pocket and the same tried-and-true skin-care products sit on my shelves. However, Korean beauty is the exception. There were approximately 2,000 South Korean beauty brands as of 2015, according to The Cut, and in the U.S., Korean skin care has steadily gained momentum since the launch of online K-beauty retailers like The Face Shop, Peach & Lily, and Sokoglam. With Sephora devoting an entire section to Korean skin care, the momentum doesn\u2019t seem to be slowing down anytime soon. If you\u2019re new to the world of K-beauty, you might feel a little intimidated at so many product choices. Where to begin? Customer reviews are a good place to start, which is why I looked to see what shoppers are gushing about. I compiled a list of top products with at least four-star ratings and 500 or more reviews. Since K-beauty buffs buy only the best, you can trust that you\u2019re making a smart skin-care selection when a product boasts hundreds of glowing comments. From moisturizers to lip masks, this list has something for everyone\u2014K-newbies and longtime K-beauty fans alike. Sephora shoppers rave about this sweet-smelling mask, which is enriched with vitamin C and antioxidants to hydrate dry, flaky lips. Buy it: $20, Sephora This moisturizing eye cream is light enough to wear under makeup but packs a heavy hydration punch, with one customer explaining it \u201cmakes me look like I've had 10 hours of sleep when I'm really running on four.\u201d Buy it: $48, Sephora Created to address signs of early aging, this water cream improves hydration and features the brand\u2019s exclusive peptide formula that promotes skin regeneration.
