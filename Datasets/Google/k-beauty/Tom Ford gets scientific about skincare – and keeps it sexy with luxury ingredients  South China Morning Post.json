    "text": "Tom Ford Beauty has joined the likes of Armani, Chanel and Dior. The fashion brand launched its first skincare line for both men and women, accomplished through advanced scientific research and clinical testing at its personal incubator, Tom Ford Research. The two skincare items \u2013 Tom Ford Research Cr\u00e8me Concentrate (50ml; US$450) and Tom Ford Research Serum Concentrate (20ml; US$360) \u2013 feature strong concentrations of three key ingredients: white porcelain cacao, caffeine and gyokuro. \u201cMy vision is to merge breakthrough skin science with true luxury, to create transformative skincare regardless of skin type or gender,\u201d says the eponymous luxury brand founder Tom Ford. Working closely with the scientific team, the incubator found that caffeine was shown to increase the skin\u2019s natural energy, hydration and brightness. In particular, sodium ions naturally found on the skin\u2019s surface to bring in hydration and moisture experienced accelerated movement with caffeine compounds. The rare white porcelain cacao, which comprises 0.5 per cent of cacao production, offers complementary benefits of caffeine. Gyokuro, a highly prized variety of green tea, is said to soothe the skin and provide protection from antioxidants. In addition to these three key ingredients, the Tom Ford Research Cr\u00e8me Concentrate features algae extract and peptides to reduce wrinkles and fine lines, and hyaluronic acid to give the skin deep hydration. The Serum Concentrate also contains glycolic and lactic acid to deliver visibly smoother skin. Want more stories like this? Sign up  here.
