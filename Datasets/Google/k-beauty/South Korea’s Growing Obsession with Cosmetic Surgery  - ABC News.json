    "text": "An estimated one in five South Korean women has had some sort of work done. June 20, 2014&#151; -- America is a country obsessed with plastic surgery. Countless tabloids and gossip sites constantly speculate on what celebrity has had work done and where. Americans dished out an estimated $12 billion on cosmetic enhancements last year alone. But there is a foreign city where plastic surgery is even more extreme than here in the U.S. Roughly 7.5 million people have traveled to this plastic surgery mecca to get work done, where there is an entire district filled with plastic surgery clinics. That city is Seoul, South Korea. There, \u201cGangnam Style\u201d has become a worldwide phenomenon -- Korean pop star Psy's music video is the most watched video in YouTube history, with more than two billion views.  A staggering one in five South Korean women has had cosmetic work done, compared to about one in 20 American women, according to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons. Korean women are seemingly trying to emulate the doll-like features of the K-pop girls in the \"Gangnam Style\" video and bands like Girls Generation. Christina Lim, 19, is one of those women. Plastic surgery is \u201ca normal thing,\u201d she said. \u201cMy friends, they would actually just go on vacation and then they would come back with a new face.\u201d Lim has appeared occasionally as a translator on Korean TV and aspires to make it a career, but feels the pressure to make some serious physical changes first. \u201cI got lots of hate comments, like, \u2018Why is she even on TV? Why is she so fat?\u2019 and I don\u2019t have the looks, I don\u2019t have that idol figure, I don\u2019t have that face,\u201d she said. She wanted surgery to have her jaw slimmed down and another to reshape her nose. \u201cI guess everyone wants to look like K-Pop idols,\u201d Lim said. \u201cYou have to look pretty, you have to have double eyelids, you have to have your v-line face, you have to be slim, but you have to have big breasts and stuff. \u201cI think everyone is trying to delete this Koreanness,\u201d she added. \u201cIn Korea, you go down the streets, you see this girl. And you walk down the street, and you see that girl again. It actually is a different person.\u201d  It\u2019s not just women living in South Korea who feel that way. People from all over the world flock to Seoul for plastic surgeons with expertise in Korean features and competitive pricing. Jessica Choi, a 33-year-old property manager for a real estate company 6,000 miles away in Los Angeles, flew to Seoul to undergo her own plastic surgery overhaul. \u201cI just always feel like my eyes were never big enough. I used to even get made fun of when I was little for having \u2018Asian eyes,\u2019\u201d Choi said. \u201cI think the results will be better in Korea because they know the Asian face better.\u201d She hoped to improve surgeries she had in the United States and undergo a series of new ones, including having her forehead reshaped, her eyes extended, her nose and chin reshaped and lip injections. \u201cIn high school, my first procedure was getting this double eyelid crease put in, and it made my eyes so much bigger. I remember how exciting that was,\u201d she said. \u201cJust recently, I had my nose done by a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon, sort of a plastic surgeon to the stars ... but it\u2019s still not what I\u2019m looking for. \u201cIt was $8,000,\u201d Choi added. \u201cIn South Korea, it\u2019s anywhere from $2,000 to $4-5000, so it\u2019s significantly cheaper.\u201d Her motivations for going through with the surgeries were more than just for looks. Choi claimed she was in an abusive marriage.  A few days later, they were recovering in neighboring twin beds in excruciating pain. Lim said she would never go through it again. \u201cIt hurts so much,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t even describe the pain. At nighttime, without the pills, I constantly feel like this knife [is] cutting through my bones, and I can\u2019t say anything because my mouth is open and I\u2019m drooling and I have cotton up my nose from the nose surgery. ... No it was a nightmare.\u201d Choi, too, felt regret after undergoing the surgeries. \u201cI've never gone through childbirth so I don\u2019t know what that kind of pain is like, but I feel like that this is the most pain that I have ever experienced in my life,\u201d she said. \u201cI just feel like I sinned. I feel like I\u2019m hearing God say, \u2018Sweetheart why would you do this? I made you perfect.\u2019 That\u2019s just the voice I kept hearing.\u201d In the next few days after her surgery, Choi documented her recovery and, as the pain diminished, so did her regret. Three months after Lim had her procedures, she was still lying in a hospital bed in almost unbearable pain. She was slightly less hard on herself than before when describing her looks. \u201cI wouldn't say pretty, but I can say that I look better now,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m happy with this face now. I\u2019ll live with this face. \u201cIt was worth it,\u201d she added. \u201cBut still, if I were to tell all my friends, if they don\u2019t have a problem living with their faces, a big face or whatever, I would tell them not to do it. I would tell them to get new friends who like their big faces.\u201d As for Choi, three months after the surgery, the pain she suffered in that hospital bed in South Korea seemed worlds away. \u201cI love it. I feel softer. I feel more feminine. I have more confidence,\u201d she said. I really believed that death would have been better during those first few days of recovery, but it was well worth it. \u201cIt\u2019s really been a sort of reflection of what transformation has been going on in the inside of me, and a lot of that is because I feel physically more attractive, and there is value to that,\u201d Choi added. \u201cI\u2019m meeting the world with a fresh face. ... Same firecracker personality, but a new outlook on life.\u201d 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events ",
