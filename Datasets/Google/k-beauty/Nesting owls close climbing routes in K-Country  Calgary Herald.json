    "text": "Heads up! Yes, literally. Early this week, Kananaskis Country officials closed some rock climbing routes near Grassi Lakes because there are Great Horned Owls nesting in a nearby cave. Apparently the owls return to the same spot every year. And, every year, conservation officers get reports of the owls dive bombing the climbers in the area. So, it\u2019s become an annual closure to prevent injury to people using the area and give the owls their space. \u201cTypically we won\u2019t remove it until late June or early July,\u201d\u00a0 said Arian Spiteri, conservation officer for Kananaskis Country. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them to be disturbed.\u201d There are, however, still areas that you can use for hiking or climbing around Grassi Lakes. For full details on the closure, see the poster below. Subscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada. Subscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.
