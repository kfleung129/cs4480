To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. By Kate Branch At least 14 times a day, the Korean actress Claudia Kim applies toner to her face. One round of seven strokes in the morning; another before bed; and pretty much whenever she can steal a few minutes to swipe, pat, repeat. That\u2019s why Kim carries a travel-size container of the soothing, oil-controlling formula from the K-beauty brand Dermatory in a black duffel bag with her wherever she goes, she explains on a rainy fall day in Manhattan\u2019s Koreatown. The remaining contents include specialty cotton pads from Japan, sunblock from Korea, and at least two masks (a shea butter infusion for her face and a cooling, herbal iteration for her feet). A mini blue lighter rounds out the self-proclaimed K-beauty junkie\u2019s \u201cessentials,\u201d but more on this in a minute. A former model, Kim returns to the big screen in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, J.K. Row\u00adling\u2019s Harry Potter follow-up. For those unfamiliar with Rowling\u2019s world of witchcraft and wizardry, Kim plays Nagini, a doomed, circus-performing snake-woman who carries a blood curse that will eventually turn her into a beast permanently. \u201cI\u2019m Nagini!\u201d she proclaims with delight as we stroll the aisles of Besfren Beauty, a small, brightly lit K-beauty boutique, where Kim has agreed to be my guide for the day. It\u2019s only the second time she has spoken about the role in public, although her fame with Hogwarts-heads precedes her. (Beside a wall of brightly colored sheet masks, a clerk recognizes the striking, porcelain-skinned 33-year-old and bows his head in appreciation of her next role.) Known for their colorful\u2014and cute!\u2014packaging and science-backed formulas, K- and J-beauty products have become a phenomenon in the West over the past few years. But for Kim, who grew up with her mother\u2019s \u201cbeauty fridge\u201d stocked with exfoliating acid peels, hydrating essences, and vitamin C facial masks (\u201cIt\u2019s like a wine fridge but for beauty products; all Korean women have them\u201d), good skin is more of a birthright than a trend. \u201cMy mother made me take 20 private classes with an expert before I was allowed to wear any makeup on my face,\u201d she reveals. This early education has paid dividends now that her job demands a camera-ready complexion, no matter the early-morning call times or the shoot locations. (Kim uses only bottled water on her face, she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to break out in a different country where you don\u2019t know what the pH levels are.\u201d) At L\u2019ovue, a big, airy space just a block away, Kim hurries over to a row of waterproof mascaras and selects her favorite by the Japanese label Kiss Me. \u201cKorean and Japanese actors swear by it,\u201d she says of the thickening-and-lengthening formula that she gifted Scarlett Johansson on the set of 2015\u2019s Avengers: Age of Ultron, her Hollywood debut. K-beauty gifting is kind of Kim\u2019s thing. \u201cIt\u2019s my love language,\u201d she quips, which should benefit her Beasts costars, including Zo\u00eb Kravitz, Ezra Miller, and Eddie Redmayne. She twists open the fuchsia tube of mascara and comes close enough to my face that I can smell her fruit-flavored lip gloss. Now, back to that lighter. \u201cTry to stay still,\u201d Kim tells me as she chars the end of a wooden cotton swab and, with surgeon-like precision, drags the burnt-black tip of the tool along the outer lashes of my left eye, causing the roots to curl upwards. \u201cI\u2019m no pro,\u201d she says, turning my face toward the mirrored wall after a finishing coat of black mascara, \u201cbut that\u2019s magic.\u201d By Kiana Murden By Kiana Murden By Lauren Mechling By Violeta Vald\u00e9s By Kiana Murden By Lauren Valenti More from Vogue See More Stories \u00a9 2023 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
