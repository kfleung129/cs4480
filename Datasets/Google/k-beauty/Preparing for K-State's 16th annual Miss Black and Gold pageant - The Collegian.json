    "text": "Each year, K-State\u2019s Alpha  Phi Alpha fraternity present young, diverse women with the opportunity to  represent themselves in the best  possible light by competing for the  title of Miss Black and Gold. Eleven contestants will compete in K-State\u2019s 16th annual Miss Black and Gold pageant this weekend. \u201cThe Miss Black and Gold pageant is  our way of showing the intelligence, talent, excellence and unheralded  beauty of African-American women on the campus of Kansas State  University,\u201d Craig Swan, senior in finance and pageant organizer, said. Contestants  are required to complete several different etiquette, resume  and  public speaking workshops in preparation for the pageant. Swan  said their mission is to show black women in a positive light,  which is  not always promoted in the news or on social media. Contestants  are responsible for selling advertisements and tickets for the pageant  and the title will go to the most well-rounded contestant. \u201cIt\u2019s a scholarship pageant, not a beauty pageant,\u201d Swan said. Contestant Raychel Gadson, senior in public relations, said  she wanted to participate in something where she would get to know strong, motivated women because she doesn\u2019t have a lot of female friends and she was looking to change that. Briana Hawkins, junior in pre-journalism and another contestant, said the pageant has not only helped her gain more confidence but learn communication and etiquette skills as well. Challenges After transferring from the University of Tampa Florida last year, Gadson had to re-adjust to being at a new school, making new friends and getting involved on a new campus. \u201cI had to start over with making friends and getting involved on campus and everything,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty shy about introducing myself to people, so I\u2019ve just been slowly trying to meet more people and get more active in campus and Black and Gold has really helped.\u201d Despite being shy, Gadson said she likes to push herself and competing in the competition would help get her out of her comfort zone. \u201cTime management, ad sales and creating my dance routine were all very challenging,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cMy dance piece is from a different culture so I had to learn the technique and give it my own flavor.\u201d Contestant Nekole Hines, freshman in pre-journalism, said she has learned just how much time management goes into preparing for the pageant. \u201cIt\u2019s a responsibility thing because you have to hold yourself accountable to memorize so much,\u201d Hines said. \u201cAnd then just keeping yourself up to par because you have to go to practice, school and then to work.\u201d Hines said one of the most challenging things is trying to balance out her personal life, school, work and Black and Gold. \u201cOne thing I\u2019ve learned is you\u2019ve got to be strong, and you have to have that mindset to get fantastic grades so you can get the GPA that you want, \u201d she said. \u201cAnd get those hours in at work so you can get that money. Black and Gold is a competition so strive for that goal to win, because I\u2019m trying to win.\u201d Preparation Following the traditional pageant format, contestants have several different rounds to prepare for. First, they have their opening number, which is where they come out and introduce themselves, followed by swimsuit, talent  and formal \u2014 which is their final number. With the amount of preparation required, Hines said it\u2019s important to realize the amount of hours you have in a day and make the most of your time. \u201cJust  the little fifteen minutes I have for me to go to work I\u2019ll say my  introduction speech in the car, just so it\u2019ll help me memorize it so I\u2019m  not looking at my notes in practice,\u201d she said. Meaning For Gadson, the pageant is about more than just competing for the title, it\u2019s about building lasting bonds within a sisterhood. \u201cBlack and Gold means getting to represent strong, intelligent and driven women of color at the K-State community,\u201d she said. When discussing what Black and Gold meant to her, Hawkins referenced a quote from one of her idols, actress and activist, Ruby Dee. \u201cRuby Dee, once said, \u2018The kind of beauty I want is the hard to get kind \u2014 that comes from within courage, strength and dignity,'\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cThat\u2019s what Black and Gold means to me \u2014 courage, strength and dignity \u2014 the beauty that is hard to get.\u201d Hines said, the title of Black and Gold represents sisters of success, and that just reminds her of how much time she invested in bettering herself and building a relationship with her competitors. Outcome With the competition just days away, Gadson said as long as she gives it her best shot and maintains her integrity through the process, she would be happy. \u201cI\u2019ve made some amazing friends, and that\u2019s the most important thing,\u201d she said. Hines said participating in the pageant and talking and performing in front of so many people is a confidence booster for her. \u201cI\u2019m\n expecting to be recognized by unknown faces after the pageant for my\nparticipation in the pageant,\u201d Hines said. \u201cJust to open the experience from me being\nin school by networking.\u201d  Tickets can be purchased from Miss Black and Gold pageant contestants for $10. The event will be held Dec. 6 at 6 p.m. in the K-State Student Union. ",
