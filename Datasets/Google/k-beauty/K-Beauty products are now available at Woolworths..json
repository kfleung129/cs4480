    "text": "A moment for some VERY good news. Because you can now buy a cult K-Beauty lip mask with your spaghetti sauce! WHAT A TIME. The Fresh Food People recently announced that K-Beauty products are now officially available for purchase online at Woolworths, via their \u2018Everyday Market\u2019. Watch: The Korean face mask trend taking over the world #skintertainment. Post continues below. The supermarket giant teamed up with Aussie K-Beauty platform STYLE STORY to offer cute little beauty aficionados (like me and you!) a diverse collection of affordable\nK-Beauty products. Meaning? Those notoriously hard-to-get products are now super accessible. I\u2019m talking about products like Laniege\u2019s beloved sleeping mask, CosRX\u2019s game-changing snail mucin and Dr Jart\u2019s Cicapair range. How good! *Squeals*. Wondering what K-Beauty gems you can pop in your online grocery cart? Here are some of my faves:    That famous snail jizz product everyone always talks about is now available at Woolies! It may seem 11/10 gross, but snail slime (it\u2019s not *really* jizz) is actually a super common ingredient in most Korean skincare products. Why? Because it works wonders\nwhen it comes to calming stressed skin, while also keeping it hydrated and happy for longer. Image: Supplied. This is one of Dr Jart\u2019s best-selling products, and it\u2019s the absolute jam for sensitive and irritated skin. It\u2019s also a real winner if you\u2019ve gone too hard on the acid front and messed up your skin barrier, because it contains a heap of skin-loving ingredients\nto calm and soothe.    I\u2019m not a big eye cream kinda gal (too lazy), but I\u2019ve tried this little number from Innisfree before - and it\u2019s bloody lovely. Keeps everything hydrated, happy and nourished. Never talks smack about you behind your back. Image: Supplied. I love this lip product. So, so much. I slap a thick layer on at night (my lips get DRY) and the next morning they\u2019re smooth and moisturised. Which is the dream.\u00a0There\u2019s a whole heap of different flavours, but Berry is the OG and one of the best\u00a0in\nmy opinion. (Closely followed by Gummy Bear). Image: STYLE STORY This jelly-textured pink sleeping mask is the easiest way to nab plump, juicy skin. Even if you\u2019ve been doom scrolling into the wee hours of the morning. Even\u00a0if you\u2019ve been out on the fun juice. It\u2019s cooling, doesn\u2019t feel sticky\nand doesn\u2019t mess around with sensitive skin. Image: Subi If there\u2019s one thing I love, it\u2019s taking off all the face junk from the day - SPF, makeup, the whole shebang. And a good cleansing balm is where it\u2019s at. This one from Subi combines antioxidant-rich Australian lemon myrtle with sea buckthorn oil to melt\naway your day's face while nourishing the skin with fatty acids and vitamin E.
