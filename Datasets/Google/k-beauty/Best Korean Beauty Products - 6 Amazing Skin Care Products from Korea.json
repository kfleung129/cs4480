    "text": "Hint: There are blackhead strips that get rid of all of your blackheads in minutes. Chances are you have your favorite staple beauty products that you buy stateside at your local drugstore and Sephora, but what you really need in your life are some Korean beauty products from abroad. \"The Koreans are so advanced with their technology and their products are very safe because each one requires a ton of certifications, since everything has to go through the Korean Food and Drug Administration (KFDA) before it goes on the market,\" says Mary Schook, licensed aesthetician and cosmetic chemist. Here are her recommendations for products that will leave you with the most gorgeous skin ever. The best part? Even though they're coming from across the world, they're affordable! 1. belif Hungarian Water Essence, $42. Essences are huge in Korea \u2014 they tend to have a slightly thicker consistency than serums but are just as lightweight, thanks to the small size of their ingredients' particles, which allows the formula to penetrate the skin more deeply. This particular one from belif (soon to be sold at Sephora stateside) brightens, calms, and helps keep your skin clear. Its ingredients include functional herbs like rosemary, which boosts microvascular circulation (by removing active oxygen, it prevents oxidation of skin tissue), keeping your skin tone clear and healthy. The formula also includes oat, which contains macrophages (a type of white blood cell that eats and digests dead skin cells), leaving you with a clear complexion. This concoction also helps build up your skin's barrier (the outermost layer of skin) in case it's been compromised by over-drying acne products that contain too many acids, peroxides, or other harsh ingredients. If your skin's barrier is damaged, there isn't anything to protect it from bacteria, so the bacteria could keep multiplying and you'll likely break out even more. 2. COSRx Acne Pimple Master Patch Set, $27 for 10 sheets of 24 patches. These badass gel-like blemish stickers keep you from picking at/popping your pimples and contain salicylic acid that helps break down dead skin and unplug clogged pores. Bonus: Keeping your breakout covered also keeps more bacteria from getting into it, which would cause it to spread. The stickers can also be used to prevent a cystic breakout from fully developing \u2014 simply put a patch over it to stop it in its tracks! To apply, peel the sticker from the backing sheet and pop it over your pimple before you go to sleep. When you wake up, expect a white opaque dot over the blemish, which indicates that the sebum has been pulled out of the pore. Once you peel the sticker away, you'll see that the pimple is mostly gone (there may still be a little redness, but the infection will be handled)! 3. SkinMiso Nose Pack Blackhead Remover, $10. This miracle worker of a product is a three-step process that legitimately works. First, you apply the blackhead/whitehead removal mask over clean skin, making sure it lays snug against your nose. During this step, the dead skin is broken down, which loosens the blackhead so it may be removed. After you peel the first strip away, use a cotton swab or washcloth and circular motions to sweep the blackheads away. Next, apply the pore-tightening strip. Lastly, there's an oil-control serum that helps seal your pores and regulate future oil production. Voil\u00e0, you're blackhead-free! 4. ElishaCoy Snail Hydrogel Mask, $28. OK, try not to get grossed out here, but snail mucus (the shiny slime that a snail leaves behind as it's going on its merry way) is actually super-hydrating to your skin: It promotes cellular turnover, it's healing, and it protects your skin's barrier from environmental elements like pollution, which is proven to break down collagen and elastin prematurely. \"Putting this snail secretion-containing mask on your face will give you the results of going to a spa, but only in a matter of 15 minutes,\" Schook says. \"Not only are you getting the hydration benefits from the snail mucus infused in the mask, there are other skin-plumping ingredients like glycerin, sea water, aloe extract, etc., that are being pushed deeper into your skin because a gel-like mask sits [and] sticks better onto the skin than a cloth mask.\" This heroic mask also contains ingredients like rosemary, which has antibacterial properties that help fight free radical damage (this can lead to premature aging and cell mutation, which can lead to skin cancer); melissa officinalis leaf extract, which is good for calming and brightening the skin; and hexapeptides that help build collagen. \"This mask is fool-proof,\" Schook says, \"because it won't dry out your skin if you leave it on too long, whereas cloth masks, once they deliver their ingredients and transfer the moisture onto your skin, can actually suck your own skin's moisture back out of your skin if left on too long, which is why you really have to stick to the time period that the packaging notates.\" 5. I'm From Honey Mask, $28. \"The Koreans are very into locally sourcing their honey \u2014 this one is sourced from Jiri Mountain where they don't use pesticides, so the formula won't be contaminated,\" Schook says. The formulation is made of 38.7 percent pure honey (not extract), and since honey is naturally antibacterial, it helps prevent acne by opening up the pores to clear out dirt, bacteria, and oil, while hydrating the skin and rebuilding a compromised barrier for stronger, healthier skin. This mask also contains shea butter, vitamin E, snail secretion, aloe, and beta-glucan, which is a yeast that dissolves dead skin cells. What's more, there isn't any water or fillers in this blend, which can breed bacteria over time; instead, glycerin is added to further hydrate the skin. 6. COSRx Silk Finger Pods, $4. These silk finger pods are made from 100 percent natural silk cocoons (don't worry, zero silk worms were harmed in collecting these \u2014 if you don't believe me, watch this) and are perfect for exfoliating sensitive skin. Silk worms create them to protect themselves as they transition from silk worms to moths. When they're ready to leave their cocoons, they exit by secreting a yellow liquid called lytic enzyme, which creates a hole in the cocoon for the moth to fly out of. Kind of gross, I know, but then the cocoons are dried out and cleaned, and the hole is made larger for human fingers to fit inside, so you can gently buff your skin with the silkiest exfoliator ever without tearing or roughing up your complexion.
