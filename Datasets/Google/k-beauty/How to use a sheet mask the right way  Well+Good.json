Okay, not\u00a0exactly. But proudly looking like a horror movie villain is just one of ways that Korean sheet masks\u2014the buzzy\u00a0beauty routine that has\u00a0taken selfie-loving\u00a0Americans by storm\u2014have left their (not always visible) mark. Why is just about\u00a0everyone obsessed with them? \"Sheet masks have been around\u00a0for over a decade in Korea,\" says Charlotte Cho, co-founder of Korean beauty site Soko Glam and author of\u00a0The Little Book of Skin Care: Korean Beauty Secrets for Healthy, Glowing Skin.\u00a0Their popularity can be explained not just because they're highly photogenic, but also because, as she notes, \"people are seeing results and they're relatively affordable.\" \"The sheet mask forms a sort of barrier that really locks the ingredients in and prevents that evaporation\" Indeed, a sheet mask serves a purpose beyond garnering \"likes\" on social media. According to the beauty guru, a lot of skin-care products actually evaporate when you put them on your face (yes, even the pricey ones). \"It takes time for those ingredients to mingle with your skin,\" she says. \"The sheet mask forms a sort of barrier that really locks the ingredients in and prevents that evaporation,\" which explains why your face\u00a0might feel plumper and looks brighter after using one. There's also the fact that, as Cho points out, the sheet versions\u00a0don't get dry and hard\u00a0like some other masks\u00a0out there\u00a0(think mud-based products\u00a0that go on thick). \"Clay really draws out excess oil, but sheet masks are providing moisture and hydrating the skin. And oily skin often needs moisture, even though many people don't realize it,\" she adds. It makes for a very user-friendly experience\u2014yes, sometimes to the extreme. \"People get addicted,\" admits Cho.\u00a0\"Some people in Korea use one daily\u2014there's a hashtag called 'one mask\u00a0a day.'\" The typical $2 price per sheet helps fuel the habit, too. {{post.sponsorText}} Which isn't to say that sheet masks are perfect: Turns out many of them\u00a0are full of alcohol, PEGs, fragrance, and preservatives like phenoxyethanol and ethylhexylglycerin. So despite the trend factor, sheet masks may not be the cleanest beauty category. The good news? We did the legwork and found three that are as natural as they get.
