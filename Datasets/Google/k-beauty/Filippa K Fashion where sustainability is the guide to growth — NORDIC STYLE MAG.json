    "text": "This week we were reached by great news. Filippa K launched three new sustainability concepts this Thursday to contribute to a fashion consumption that takes the nature into consideration. The new concepts live up to the vision of the brand \u2013 fashion where sustainability is the guide to growth.One of the concepts is named \u201cCollect\u201d and is a way for Filippa K to reuse their old garments. You can now return your old clothing from Filippa K to your local store in Denmark and Sweden, not only will you help the nature but you\u2019ll get 15% off your next purchase. The garments collected will be sold in Filippa K\u2019s second hand store or given to collaborating charity organizations. In Denmark the donations will go to the Red Cross\u00a0and in Sweden they\u2019ll go to Stadsmissionen.\"Filippa K stands for long lasting simplicity. This means that we believe that our garments are long lasting in both design and quality. \"The second sustainability concept is called \"Lease\" and aims to contribute to a more sustainable fashion consumption by letting customers rent pieces for special occasions. Filippa K will choose new favorites for the leasing wardrobe every season and the pieces are offered for 20% of retail price for a four day lease. The concept has been launched for both men and women in three stores, two in Stockholm and one in Uppsala.\"This is an alternative way of looking great while creating a minimal footprint.\"The third concept is the \"Front Runners\" collection with three pieces made of\u00a0100% renewable and natural Tencel. Every part of the process from design choices and production to the end of the garments' life has been carefully\u00a0thought through. Filippa K has also come up with twelve criteria that must be fulfilled by every future garment of the Front Runners collections. Read more about the criteria and see the collection\u00a0here.\"We are devoted to four R:s \u2013 Reducing, Repairing, Reusing and Recycling.\"Picture courtesy of Filippa K about us & contact - instagram facebook twitter - listen to \u2018the nordic podcast\u2019 - \u00a9 nordic style magazine 2022 designed by taka me\u00f0 st\u00fad\u00ed\u00f3 about us & contact   |   instagram facebook twitter   |   listen to \u2018the nordic podcast\u2019 \u00a9 nordic style magazine 2022   |   designed by taka me\u00f0 st\u00fad\u00ed\u00f3 ",
