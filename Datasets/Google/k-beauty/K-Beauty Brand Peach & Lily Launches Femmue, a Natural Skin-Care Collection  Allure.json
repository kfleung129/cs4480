    "text": "By Macaela Mackenzie Korean beauty retailer Peach & Lily has helped bring K-beauty to the level of cult obsession it\u2019s currently enjoying. (See: Peach & Lily\u2019s exclusive and affordable collection for CVS \u2014 and then go shop it all.) The retailer\u2019s latest launch is one that will have natural beauty fans rejoicing. This week, Peach & Lily founder Alicia Yoon launched her latest discovery on the website \u2014 meet Femmue, a line of botanical beauty products that deliver \u201chigh-powered flower therapy.\u201d According to a report by WWD, the natural South Korean collection of facial oils, masks, a cleansing balm and a peel (which is being sold exclusively with Peach & Lily), is inspired by the energy of flowers. \u201cIt hits all the right notes: natural formulas, surprising and delightful textures that give the brand a certain whimsy and playfulness, a totally indulgent experience, beautiful packaging and gorgeous colors and textures, and importantly, visible results,\u201d Yoon told WWD. For the K-beauty expert, three things really set Femmue apart. First of all, the science behind the au naturale skin care is legit. Femmue, reports WWD, partners with a research lab in South Korea that produces data on the powers of floral extracts. \u201cThe formulas are not just marketing floral concepts, but grounded in decades of scientific research to ensure the products are high-performing while still being almost 100 percent natural,\u201d Yoon said. Secondly, the formulas stay true to Mother Nature\u2019s inspiration, with no artificial fragrances. There\u2019s the Flower Infused Fine Mask ($40) a \u201cjuicy\u201d mask packed with antioxidants and camellia petals; the Gypsy Rose Calming Mask ($38), a gentle pink clay mask formulated with green tea oils and rose extracts; Ideal Oil ($58), a pure blend of camelia, olive, rose, grapeseed and jasmine oils; the Extraordinary Beauty Cleansing Balm ($42), boosted with citrus and bergamot, and Lumi\u00e8re Vital C ($88), packed with Vitamin C and hyalauronic acid to brighten and smooth skin. Finally, the formulas have sumptuous textures \u2014 some of which are even shape shifting, like the cleansing balm that starts as a jelly and melts into a silky oil on your skin. Into it? You\u2019re in luck. Not only can you shop Femmue now, Yoon told WWD that more products from the flower power brand are already in the works.
