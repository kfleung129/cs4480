(2011 single, \u201cDon\u2019t Say Goodbye\u201d reigned for three consecutive weeks from Sept. 7 to Sept. 21.)

Core Contents Media (CCM) has announced lineup changes to three acts. Most notably, member Areum will leave controversial girl group T-ara. The once-major powerhouses (with two K-Pop No. 1s) were rocked by a bullying scandal last summer when rapper Hwayoung was unexpectedly kicked out of the group. The group has still not recovered from the scandal fully, focusing on overseas markets and sub-units recently. 19-year-old Areum will promote as a solo artist under the label. Her spot in T-ara N4 will be filled by English-speaking CCM trainee Dani. Luckily for the girls, CCM has handled the transition better than Hwayoung\u2019s situation. Additionally, CCM\u2019s boy band SPEED will add two members for what is described as a special project. Though, it\u2019s not clear if the two male members will stay in SPEED when it ends. Lastly, 5dolls \u2014 who will now be known as F-ve Dolls \u2014 will now consist of six girls with original members (Eunkyo, Hyoyoung and Hyewon) and three new members, including one from another girl group The SeeYa, Yeonkyung. She will promote in both groups.  Hip-hop heavyweights Dynamic Duo make a super-strong comeback this week, placing 11 tracks from their seventh LP, \u201cLUCKYNUMBERS\u201d on the chart this week. \u00a0Two made it to the Top 10: lead single, \u201cBAAAM\u201d rises to No. 3 while \u201cHot Wings\u201d featuring SISTAR\u2019s Hyorin lands at No. 10. \u201cBAAAM\u201d (translated to \u201cSnake\u201d in Korean) sees both members express the frustration of being swindled by a woman, but admiring her at the same time, over heavy beats. Dynamic Duo has consistently charmed hip-hop aficionados for 14 years and their huge, die-hard fanbase follows their every move, which might explain the tremendous success of \u201cLUCKYNUMBERS.\u201d The rest of the tracks off \u201cLUCKYNUMBERS\u201d stack up thusly: \u00a0\u201cThree Dopeboyz\u201d (No. 12), \u201cLife Is Good\u201d (No. 19), \u201cReturn Of The Kings\u201d (No. 32), \u201cGrand Slam\u201d (No. 37), \u201cAirplane Mode\u201d (No. 54), \u201cGood Morning Love\u201d (No. 55), \u201cLet\u2019s Meet Often\u201d (No. 56), \u201cCrime Scene\u201d (No. 67), and \u201cTragedy Part.2\u201d (No. 76).  Rising K-pop girl group Apink (who recently lost member Yu Kyung) earn their highest-charting single on the K-Pop Hot 100 this week with \u201cNoNoNo.\u201d The single combines the sextet\u2019s adorable charms and still-maturing voices with bubblegum pop and unexpected, but much welcomed, funky dance sections. The video complements the song showing a colorful set with the girls throwing a birthday party accompanied by cupcakes, balloons and flowers. But there\u2019s a sexy undertone to contrast the sugary-sweet scenery showing the girls shaking their backsides to the camera during the chorus.  With Davichi and Apink as shining examples, girl groups continue to rule the K-Pop Hot 100. This week also sees entries from SISTAR (\u201cGive It to Me\u201d falls from No. 1 to No. 4), 4minute (\u201cIs It Poppin\u2019?\u201d holds at No. 6), Girl\u2019s Day (\u201cFemale President\u201d falls two spots to No. 9) and Dynamic Duo\u2019s aforementioned \u201cHot Wings\u201d featuring Hyorin of SISTAR. Next week expect even more girl group to make big moves as next week\u2019s chart will reflect a full week of sales from 2NE1 (\u201cFalling in Love\u201d starts at No. 11 this week) and Brown Eyed Girls (\u201cRecipe\u201d at No. 31).
