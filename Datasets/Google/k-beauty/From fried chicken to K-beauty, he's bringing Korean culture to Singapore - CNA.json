Now the owner of two K-beauty salons, one of which houses a cafe, Yi finds joy in bringing unique lifestyle experiences to Singapore. Korean F&B and beauty entrepreneur, Luke Yi. (Photo: Alvin Teo) As a former consultant in the IT industry, Luke Yi enjoyed much success in the corporate world, having worked for big names such as Hewlett-Packard and\u00a0Cisco Systems. But after 16 years in the industry, Yi found himself listless and bored. \u201cThe work was very routine,\u201d he lamented. \u201cI was also travelling a lot. More than half of my time was spent on the plane.\u201d Born in South Korea, Yi migrated to New Zealand at the age of 18. After working in Australia for 10 years, he moved to Singapore. \u201cWhen I was back in town, my time with family was very precious,\u201d shared the 45-year-old father of two. \u201cWhen you\u2019re busy, every hour is\u00a0important. So when you go to a restaurant and find that the place serves good food, but the service level isn\u2019t fantastic, you tend to be disappointed.\u201d Yi\u2019s dismay at the service standards in Singapore\u2019s F&B scene, coupled with his eagerness to do \u201csomething more fun\u201d, sparked the birth of Chicken Up in 2012. When Chicken Up first opened, it was one of Singapore\u2019s first Korean fried chicken chains, sparking a craze. \u201cBack then, many of my friends in Singapore thought that Korean food is all about barbecue. But growing up in Korea, I know that there\u2019s a lot more variety. It\u2019s just easier to set up a Korean barbecue restaurant here,\u201d he shared. \u201cI chose to do fried chicken because in Singapore, there\u2019s a mix of different races. Some don\u2019t eat beef and some don\u2019t eat pork, so chicken is more commonly accepted.\u201d Nine years later, Yi\u2019s entrepreneurship journey has seen him expand into the beauty industry with the opening of Korean beauty salon, Leekaja. Marrying both the F&B and beauty worlds, he opened Walking On Sunshine, a hair salon-cum-cafe, in 2018. While Yi believes there\u2019s a strong appetite for Korean-related experiences in Singapore, \u201cthere\u2019s still a lot more to explore,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m here to bring in more Korean experiences, and not just the shell of it, but the entire culture as well.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m here to bring in more Korean experiences, and not just the shell of it, but the entire culture as well.\u201d \u2013 Luke Yi COOKING UP A STORM Underpinning Yi\u2019s entire entrepreneurial journey is a desire to bring innovation to traditional industries, he shared. When Chicken Up first opened in Singapore, Yi was eager to create an F&B establishment where diners did more than just eat and exit. \u201cI was inspired to incorporate the distinctly fun style of Korean service to the Singapore restaurant scene. This way, I was able to acquaint Singaporeans with the idea of Korean culture through the food that we serve, and the Korean hospitality that comes with it,\u201d Yi shared. \u201cWe created a fun drinking culture at Chicken Up with our flavoured soju drinks such as watermelon, apple and pineapple, which were quite big hits at the time. We also trained our staff according to airline service standards so they would be more welcoming and attentive. We even had an incentive for them to remember the names of our regulars.\u201d After the success of Chicken Up, Yi opened Korean-Mexican bistro Don\u2019t Tell Mama. While Korean and Mexican food seemed like an odd pairing at the time, it was a popular concept back in Korea. The fusion bistro bar has since become a hit in the Tanjong Pagar area. Yi\u2019s F&B portfolio also includes the now-defunct Korean street food outlet Baro Baro. Having achieved success in the F&B world, Yi was soon in search for a new industry to take on. \u201cThe thing with the F&B industry is that customer loyalty is very shallow. If diners like the food, they may come back. But people like to try new restaurants,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to also to prove to myself that the success of Chicken Up wasn\u2019t just pure luck.\" SHAKING UP THE BEAUTY INDUSTRY Beauty, he believes, is an industry with higher customer retention.\u00a0At the time, he felt that the beauty industry in Singapore was in need of a shakeup. \u201cWhen I first came to Singapore, not many people wore make-up. But in Korea, people wear make-up even to go to the grocery store,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I knew there was a growing interest in the importance of looking good, so I waited for the right opportunity to go into the beauty industry to make it a little bit more exciting.\u201d That opportunity came in late 2016 when Yi partnered with Korean beauty entrepreneur Madam Leekaja to open the first Leekaja Beauty Salon in Singapore. Leekaja is an established Korean beauty salon chain back in its home country, the first to be franchised worldwide. It now boasts over 200 stores around the world. \u201cA long time ago, people were obsessed with Hong Kong culture, and then it was Japanese culture. Now it is Korean culture.\" \u2013 Luke Yi The Leekaja Singapore website touts a \u201cfull Korean beauty experience without having to travel to Seoul\u201d. Located at Mandarin Gallery, it offers not only hairstyling services, but make-up, eyebrow, eyelash and nail services as well. \u201cKorea is widely known as one of the leaders in the beauty industry. Singaporeans have also been riding the Korean wave and many are obsessed with K-dramas. Right away, we received a lot of demand and requests for our stylists to recreate hairstyles referenced from K-dramas,\u201d Yi said. Beyond hiring Korean hairstylists, the salon prides itself for its customer service standards. \u201cWe have three to four customer service officers, and what they do is ensure that customers are happy and satisfied. It\u2019s a heavy investment actually, but at a lot of other places, there\u2019s not enough receptionists, which results in a lot of waiting around.\u201d At Leekaja, customers are seated at their very own spacious stations. It can sometimes take hours to get their hair\u00a0done, so guests are given a robe and a pillow for comfort. While many beauty salons in Singapore tie customers down by pushing the sale of packages, Leekaja prefers to let its experience do the selling. \u201cWe don\u2019t sell packages, we never sell packages. We let our customers enjoy the experience and if they value that, they will come back.\u201d Yi\u2019s latest venture, however, is an innovative hair salon-cum-cafe, aptly named Walking On Sunshine. Located at Orchard Central, the secret garden-themed cafe is shrouded in lush foliage, surrounded with over a thousand potted plants. By the side of the cafe sits an expansive hair salon which offers just about anything from a haircut to a dye job. Since its opening in 2018, Walking On Sunshine has attracted a strong following, particularly those eager to snap a photo at one of its Instagram-worthy spots. \u201cI was in the F&B industry and then in beauty, and I always wanted to combine the two together to create a place where people can do many things at once. So take a family spending time together on a weekend. Father and daughter can enjoy a meal while mum gets her hair and nails done. Then they can take turns,\u201d Yi explained. \u201cAnyone can say that they\u2019re the top hair salon or cafe in the country, but we actually let our customers experience it. If I tell them a bunch of facts, they will probably not remember it the next few days. But the feeling they felt while being here is something that will last longer.\u201d ON TO THE NEXT BIG THING With his corporate life a distant memory now, Yi has no regrets about striking out on his own. A self-professed workaholic, Yi believes that the best part of becoming an entrepreneur in the beauty and F&B space is the ability to meet new people every day. \u201cWhen I was in IT, the only people that I hung out with was IT guys,\u201d he laughed. \u201cBut now, I get to socialise with different kinds of people, and that was what really pulled me into the service industry.\u201d Bigger plans are already in the works. He\u2019s currently aiming\u00a0towards opening four or five \u201cmega-salons\u201d in the next eighteen months, which will be bigger than what he has already started. While Walking On Sunshine combines a hair salon with a cafe, one of the upcoming mega-salons will feature a beauty salon, cafe and a pilates studio. \u201cAfter pilates, visitors can take a shower, then get their hair and makeup done. After that, they can enjoy healthy vegan food at the cafe with their friends. We want to create a space where people can spend hours and hours, without having to travel back and forth.\u201d While Yi believes the Korean wave is here to stay for now, he\u2019s aware that things may not be the same in the future. \u201cA long time ago, people were obsessed with Hong Kong culture, and then it was Japanese culture. Now it is Korean culture, but that might change in a few years,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cBut because people can\u2019t travel for now, I think they will look for unique, different experiences. That\u2019s where I hope to spice things up.\u201d \u201cBecause people can\u2019t travel for now, I think they will look for unique, different experiences.
