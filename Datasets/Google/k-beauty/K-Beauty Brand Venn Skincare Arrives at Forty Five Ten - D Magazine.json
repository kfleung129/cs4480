    "text": "Is it just me, or has skincare gotten a little bit nuts lately? I asked myself this question as I stood over my bathroom sink applying snail mucin essence\u2013literal snail juice\u2013to my face, and zapping my blemishes with a high-frequency wand. My medicine cabinet overrunneth with sheet masks, serums, sprays, toners, spot treatments, and mystery samples. I don\u2019t know what most of these things do; I simply hope they do something. I have problem skin, and I\u2019m a sucker for solutions. I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s fallen for the gimmick of the 20-step skincare routine. Consumers are using more and more products, an approach that can actually cancel out the effectiveness of each product, not to mention the environmental repercussions of beauty overindulgence. While K-beauty brands are typically known for their extensive, wide-ranging product lines, there\u2019s one South Korean skincare brand that\u2019s trying to minimize your daily routine. Dallas\u2019 Forty Five Ten just started carrying Venn Skincare, a scientist-backed brand with a less-is-more mentality. The company currently has a total of five products that are supposed to deliver all the benefits of a complicated skincare regimen in only a couple steps. Founded by a corporate attorney and a chemist, the South Korean brand offers a cleanser, two moisturizer-like concentrates, a serum, and a lifting mask. The products are made for all skin types, so they\u2019re okay for sensitive skin despite being potent. I haven\u2019t started my minimalist Venn routine yet, so I can\u2019t vouch for their products, but I\u2019m already impressed by the two concentrates. If you want a moisturizer that also works to improve your complexion and reduce wrinkles, the Age-Reversing All-In-One Concentrate is worth trying (see the rave reviews).\u00a0 You can check out the products in person at Forty Five Ten in downtown.
