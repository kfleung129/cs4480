    "text": "Boy band SHINee are celebrating five years on the K-pop scene and sat down with Billboard to talk about their latest music and plans for the future. By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJeff Benjamin As is the case with labelmates Girls\u2019 Generation and TVXQ!, there is always a huge amount of hype whenever SM Entertainment returns with one of their artists. There was no exception when five-member boy band SHINee \u2014 who have proven themselves as Korea\u2019s five mini Michael Jacksons with their harmonies recalling The Jackson 5 \u2014 returned last month.

But with this latest album, SHINee confirms they are more than just a flashy idol group with a catchy single here and there. Related\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBTS' V Drops Two Very Different Remixes of 'Slow Dancing' Solo Single\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t03/12/2013 The 2011 mini-album \u201cSherlock\u201d indicated the path with seven solid tracks even though two of them (\u201cClue\u201d and \u201cNote\u201d) were combined for a hybrid remix that was lead single \u201cSherlock\u201d that peaked at No. 3 on the K-Pop Hot 100. On their latest album, the first part in a two-disc collection, SHINee crafted nine even stronger tracks to push themselves into album artist territory. The lead single, \u201cDream Girl,\u201d is a safe, enjoyable mainstream single and, unexpectedly, brings them back to the top of the charts; this week at No. 4 on the K-Pop Hot 100. But the album is a triumph that never lacks in energy and balances nods to 80s pop stars and forward-thinking pop. Songs like \u201cPunch Love Drunk\u201d and \u201cAside\u201d sonically recall the sounds of Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie, respectively. While tracks like \u201cBeautiful\u201d and \u201cRunaway\u201d combine unique electronic production elements over sugary boy band harmonies to create year-round pop music. SHINee took time to chat about their new album and entering a fifth year in the industry at Billboard Korea\u2019s studios. Check out the exclusive video interview and Q&A session below.   Tell us about the new album.With this album, we tried our best to put out music that really defined us. Although, we\u2019re satisfied with the results, there are some parts that we feel like are still missing or lacking. [Our last EP] \u201cSherlock\u201d was musically well made, but it was hard to sing along. The strength of [new single] \u201cDream Girl\u201d is that it has metro vibes and it\u2019s easy to follow. \u201cChapter 2\u201d will be released soon. This year, we are going to be releasing a lot of our music. What drew you to \u201cDream Girl,\u201d your latest single?We found \u201cDream Girl\u201d after searching for a song that is relatable and easy sing along to. SHINee\u2019s musical color was incorporated in it, as well. I think we were able to try out many new things with our careers, because of our fans support. We know that we can\u2019t be afraid of new challenges or we won\u2019t gain anything. Now, with almost five years in the industry, what do you feel is the biggest misconception about SHINee?Jonghyun: The misconception that the public has of us is that they think we are still teenagers. [Youngest member Taemin just turned 20] It\u2019s a misconception that makes us feel good! [laughs]. Our fans think that we are still teenagers. The only negative thing about that is we have more pressure when trying out new endeavors. I hope we can somehow naturally break everyone\u2019s conception of our boy-like image and age. But we are still enjoying it. We had our first club performance not too long ago, and the audiences seemed baffled. I think they thought we were too young to be at a club! Was SHINee influenced by any artists while working on this album? Your work has drawn comparisons to Michael Jackson and The Jackson 5\u2019s work.\u00a0Jonghyun: It\u2019s not that we want to copy what he [Michael Jackson] does, but, rather, we wanted to pursue similar values and a similar musical path. NEXT: \u201cThe barriers to the worldwide music market are slowly breaking down\u201d   Over the years, you\u2019ve become synonymous with spot-on live performances. What\u2019s the secret?Minho: Every time we prepare for our concerts or performances, we always go in with the mindset that we are lacking in something. We have this urge to be flawless on stage. I think people look at us in a positive light, because they can see and feel our efforts. What were some of the hardships you\u2019ve endured in the last five years?Jonghyun: It is our job to get over our hardships and slumps. We rest when we are sick because, even if we wanted to, our bodies wouldn\u2019t really function the way we want to. Now, our members are good at taking care of their health; we work more effectively. Are there overseas fans or concerts that particularly stand out in your memory?It\u2019s hard to pick one specific fan or country, because there are too many we\u2019ve visited. But every single concert and fan will forever be embedded in our memory. We haven\u2019t been to South America yet. We would love to perform in South America one day.  Do you guys have any plans to crossover to the States?The barriers to the worldwide music market are slowly breaking down. It is now a generation where K-pop can be easily heard anywhere. K-pop doesn\u2019t necessarily have to officially debut on an extravagant scale to be accessed or heard. We are promoting in Korea, but our fans outside of Korea get to see us through many outlets. If given a good opportunity, then we want to debut in the U.S. What are your favorite SHINee songs?Key: \u201cDream Girl\u201d is great, but I think audiences enjoyed \u201cSherlock.\u201d I think it\u2019s because there are a lot of elements packed into one song.Taemin: I would like to recommend \u201cAfter Putting On Makeup\u201d off our 1st LP, \u201cThe SHINee World.\u201d All of our albums are meaningful to us, but I have more attachment towards it because it is our first album.Jonghyun: I would like to recommend our ballad tracks, \u201cI Can\u2019t If It Isn\u2019t You,\u201d and \u201cArrow.\u201d We never sang these songs on TV. Most people think we are a very performance-oriented group, but upon hearing these songs, people will realize we are a group that can do other genres like ballads.Onew: I want to recommend \u201cDynamite.\u201d I had fun recording this song, because it\u2019s such an exciting, refreshing track. My vocal range isn\u2019t that high, but while recording this song, my voice opened up. Looking forward, what are SHINee\u2019s goals?It is our goal to find our distinct musical colors as well as our individuality. This year, we are going to be showing and presenting a lot of our music\u2026as well as many other things! Looking at your fellow members, what would you like to learn from one another?Jonghyun: I want to pull fancy dance moves like Taemin.Onew: I want to be able to dance well, too.Minho: I have a lower vocal range, so I would like to hit higher vocal pitches.Taemin: I envy Jonghyun\u2019s technique and energy, Onew\u2019s voice, Key\u2019s rapping skills and Minho\u2019s looks. SHINEE\u2019s musical growth over the past five years is stunning. To get these results, how much research do you think the management put in and how much effort did SHINee put in?Taemin: The group is under a large agency, so we did get those benefits. However, each and every member has a strong will and is very ambitious. We practiced a lot.Onew: Our seniors from TVXQ! have been a huge inspiration to us.Key: We constantly practiced even after we debuted. We don\u2019t just sing and dance, we act too. While working on this album, there were multiple times where we went into the studio when the sun rose and left only after the sun set.
