AmorePacific Group and LG  Household & Healthcare (LG H&H) \u2013 the  country's top cosmetics makers \u2013 outperformed last year,  rallying 183 and 16 percent respectively. By contrast,  traditional Kospi index heavyweights  Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor fell nearly 5 and 30 percent  as cut-throat competition weighed on sales. That trend appears unlikely to change as Hallyu \u2013 the Korean  term for the popularity of South Korean pop-culture abroad \u2013  continues to spur the fashion and tourism industries. The  meteoric success of last year's K-drama \"My love from the Star\" boosted sales of luxury  items and cosmetics adorned by lead actress Gianna Jun. For one,  a neon orange lipstick by AmorePacific's beauty brand Laneige  sold out in countries including China and Singapore. According to government data, South Korea's cosmetics exports  surged 52 percent on-year in 2014, amid increased demand from  China. This underpinned 52 and 31 percent jumps in AmorePacific  and LG H&H's operating profit, respectively, last year. \"if you look at Chinese inbound travel into Korea, it's proof  that Seoul (and Jeju) are now firmly on the map and anything  Korean is cool in the eyes of Chinese (and many other Asian)  consumers,\" Erwan Rambourg, managing director and  global co-head of consumer and retail at HSBC, told CNBC. \"Also,  many of the successful brands are just starting to develop in  terms of awareness so I believe [in terms of sales] they still have legs.\" Wave to grow or break? AmorePacific and LG H&H stand out as \"good long-term  investments,\" says CLSA, as their cosmetics products will likely  enjoy increasing popularity among China's middle class. \"We expect [both companies'] profits to grow as more Chinese  tourists buy their products in Korea [and as] they expand their  market shares in China,\" Oliver Matthew, head of Consumer Japan  & Korea, Japan Telecom, Media and Internet at CLSA, wrote in  an email to CNBC. Read MoreKeep faith in South Korean shares?  Maybe not, say experts Credit Suisse, which has an  \"outperform\" rating on LG H&H, agrees: \"The rapid growth of  beauty brands should raise investors' confidence given this is  good indication of LG's potential in overseas market. Recent  sales data also suggest the growing popularity of LG's household  goods among the Chinese,\" analysts wrote in a note. But Daewoo Securities' analyst Regina Hahm, who has a buy rating  on both stocks, sounded a note of caution: \"LG H&H lacks  capabilities in marketing. So while their products are good in  quality, they are less well-known and not forgetting, challenges  remain in its beverage division.\" Meanwhile, Hahm says shares of AmorePacific may have  \"overshot\u2026 as of late\" and could see a pullback before  reaching a target price of 3,100,000  over the next 12 months. AmorePacific and LG H&H  finished at 2,762,000 and 653,000 won on Tuesday. Other top picks Another market darling is duty-free shop operator Hotel Shilla, which Daewoo Securities believes has  the biggest upside potential in the consumer space this year.  Daewoo's target price of 162,000 won, which represents a 70  percent upside from current trading levels, is premised upon  continued improvements in the domestic market and overseas  expansions. Meanwhile, CLSA's Matthew has a \"buy\" rating on department store  giant Shinsegae despite a gloomy  retail market. While sales at South Korea's top department and  discount stores rebounded sharply in February due to the Lunar  New Year holiday, combined sales fell for five straight months  prior to that, with January's department store sales marking the  steepest contraction on record. \"Some companies are beneficiaries of the Korean Wave, but  certainly not all. We prefer consumer stocks with high exposure  to women spending, strong pricing power and profitable  opportunities [in China],\" said CLSA's Matthew, who has a target  price of 230,000 won for Shinsegae, representing a 32 percent  rise from where the stock closed on Tuesday. \"Shares [of Shinsegae] are too cheap and their profits will grow  again in 2015,\" he added.
