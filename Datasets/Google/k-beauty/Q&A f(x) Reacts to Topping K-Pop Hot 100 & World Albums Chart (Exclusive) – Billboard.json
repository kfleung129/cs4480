    "text": "Backstage at KCON 2013, the K-pop group talks their big year and details filming a Funny or Die skit with Anna Kendrick. By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJeff Benjamin Girl groups were in short supply at KCON 2013. Though, given f(x)\u2019s whirlwind 2013, they likely would have more than sufficed even without a last-minute addition of Crayon Pop at the American K-pop convention. Despite being away from the K-pop scene for over a year, the female quintet saw their domestic and international popularity maintained with new single \u201cRum Pum Pum Pum\u201d hitting No. 1 on the K-Pop Hot 100. Meanwhile, its accompanying full-length album, \u201cPink Tape,\u201d not only topped Billboard\u2019s World Album chart, but also placed on Billboard\u2019s Heatseekers Albums chart \u2014 meaning a Billboard 200 entry wasn\u2019t too far away.

One could argue the quirky confections on the LP represent the contrasting personalities of the five f(x) members \u2014 on display as the quintet sit down for an interview with Billboard hours before opening KCON\u2019s grand finale K-pop concert. Cool and calm, members Sulli and San Francisco-bred Krystal appear guarded at first. However, undeniable f(x) sweetheart Luna wears a huge smile on her face the entire chat and during the KCON concert \u2014 at one point appearing to stray from her group\u2019s choreography to wave to fans on the other side of the stage. 26-year-old leader Victoria is nice, but nervous; likely anxious to present her band in the best light possible. Meanwhile, Los Angeles native Amber enters the room like a sledgehammer of confident energy, perhaps from being most comfortable speaking in English and having sister Jackie backstage. But minutes into talking with f(x), the girls\u2019 personalities blend into one with a collective concern for fans and a genuine excitement seeing their hard work result in success \u2014 even reserved Krystal breaks character for a second, loudly exclaiming \u201cReally?!\u201d after a mention that f(x) topped World Albums. Billboard gets f(x)\u2019s reactions on the year so far. KCON 2013: 15 Things Seen & Heard  Welcome to Los Angeles, f(x). You\u2019re here today to perform at KCON 2013, but you made your K-pop debut in 2009. How did you decide what three songs to perform today?  Krystal: We\u2019re performing our new song \u201cRum Pum Pum Pum,\u201d \u201cElectric Shock\u201d and \u201cHot Summer.\u201d The reason why we\u2019re performing them is that \u201cRum Pum Pum Pum\u201d is our new song; it\u2019s our first time performing it in the States. \u201cElectric Shock\u201d is really noisy. And we\u2019re performing \u201cHot Summer\u201d because it\u2019s so hot outside.  \u201cRum Pum Pum Pum\u201d has a lot of layers and harmonies. Are you at all nervous about performing it live tonight? Sulli: The song is difficult to sing live, but our main concern is that we just want our fans to enjoy our performances. NEXT: \u201cWe were like, \u2018Dude! It\u2019s been a year. How are we going to do?!'\u201d  Another note about \u201cRum Pum Pum Pum\u201d \u2014 it went No. 1 on the Billboard Korea K-Pop Hot 100, making it your first chart-topper. How did that feel? Luna: We were really nervous about releasing this song, we are always nervous before a comeback. So it\u2019s really awesome that it is doing so well. Amber: It\u2019s been a more than a year since we promoted. It was really reassuring to know our fans were still there and supporting us all the way. Honestly, we were really scared before we came back. We were like, \u201cDude! It\u2019s been a year. How are we going to do?!\u201d \u201cRum Pum Pum Pum\u201d is lifted from the \u201cPink Tape\u201d album, which gave you another No. 1, this time on Billboard\u2019s World Albums chart. How does it feel to see your international popularity exemplified like that? Luna: First of all, we are really happy and when we first heard the news\u2026 we were really surprised. The fact that we are receiving so much love and attention from fans from all over the world is an amazing feeling.  Amber: Speaking for K-pop, it shows how global a group can be. It\u2019s crazy. I was actually freaked out when I saw that. I\u2019m glad the fans still love it and we want to do everything we can.  You\u2019ve had such a warm welcome back, even though you\u2019ve been gone from the scene for over a year. What were you up to that whole time? Victoria: We focused on our individual activities, including acting and other solo projects. But you did come together to perform at SXSW, not to mention collaborate on a Funny or Die skit with Anna Kendrick. What was that experience like? Victoria: It was fun! To be able to collaborate with a star like Anna Kendrick was an honor. We were able to balance out recording in English because we have English-speaking members. Do you anything you\u2019d like to add for your fans? Luna: We want to show as much as we can to our global fans and visit many countries as much as we can.
