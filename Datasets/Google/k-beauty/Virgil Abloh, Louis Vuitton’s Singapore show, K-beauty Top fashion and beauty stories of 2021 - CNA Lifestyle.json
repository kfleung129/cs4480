On the news front, we went from the high of Louis Vuitton pulling out all the stops for Singapore\u2019s first physical fashion runway show since the pandemic gripped the world to the low of losing three great designers: Tiffany & Co\u2019s Elsa Peretti, AZ Factory\u2019s Alber Elbaz (formerly of Lanvin fame) and Louis Vuitton\u2019s Virgil Abloh. But those weren't the only stories that mattered to readers, who were also interested in everything from looking and feeling exceptional, especially in these trying times.\u00a0CNA Lifestyle looks back the most popular stories from our Style & Beauty section. FASHION GIANTS WE LOST IN 2021 We lost a few greats this year. Famed Tiffany & Co jewellery designer Elsa Peretti died at age 80 on Mar 20. An ex-Halston model, Peretti began designing for the famed American institution in 1974. Drawn from everyday designs, the Italian-born designer dreamt up more than three dozen collections for Tiffany & Co,\u00a0the most iconic being the wrist-hugging Bone Cuff and Diamonds By The Yard.

The Moroccan-born fashion designer was best known for reviving the French couture house Lanvin with his modern takes on silk cocktail dresses and colourful, feminine designs during a 14-year tenure there. Elbaz had been working on AZ Factory, a fashion joint venture with Richemont since 2019 till his death. Read the story here. Louis Vuitton\u2019s star designer Virgil Abloh died on Nov 28 following a private battle with cancer. He was 41. Abloh had been undergoing challenging treatments privately since his diagnosis in 2019, while helming Louis Vuitton\u2019s men\u2019s universe and Off-White that span fashion, art and culture. His last menswear collection for Louis Vuitton was transformed into a tribute to Abloh. The show closed with a recording of Abloh\u2019s voice. \u201cThere\u2019s no limit,\u201d said Abloh in the recording. \u201cLife is so short that you can\u2019t waste even a day subscribing to what someone thinks you can do versus knowing what you can do.\u201d The night sky was set ablaze with an eruption of fireworks of a scribble that read: \"Virgil was here.\" Read the story here. LOUIS VUITTON\u2019S FIRST PHYGITAL FASHION SHOW IN SINGAPORE Pandemic or not, the show went on. Louis Vuitton pulled off the first runway show in Singapore since COVID-19 struck.
