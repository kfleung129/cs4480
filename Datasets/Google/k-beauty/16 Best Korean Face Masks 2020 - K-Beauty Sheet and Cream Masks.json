Grab a K-beauty sheet mask and get ready for poreless skin. Korean skincare products are well-loved for helping preserve that youthful, glowy look. From hydrating sheet masks to collagen creams that promise all the bounce, K-beauty products aren't going anywhere anytime soon. While the Good Housekeeping Institute hasn't tested all of the K-beauty masks on the market, we have evaluated top Korean brands, including face masks. In Beauty Lab tests on sheet masks and overnight hydrating masks, we enlisted consumer testers to review and rate masks based on ease of use and satisfaction. In our Lab, we tested for factors including moisture efficacy, efficiency of each mask's instructions, and more to get a holistic view on the best masks on the market for every type of skin. See below for the best Korean face masks, according to our Beauty Lab engineers, top picks and tips from  dermatologist Dr. Stacy Chimento, M.D. and dermatopathologist Gretchen Frieling, M.D.,  plus face masks we found with rave reviews online. Whether you're looking to clear up acne or plump up your skin, you'll find a mask to treat your personal skin concerns. Our Beauty Lab experts deemed this pick the best overnight mask in testing because it increased skin hydration by 49%. It also performed better than other overnight masks with high moisturizing claims, and testers reported that the product soaked quickly into the skin. It contains amino acids and a mineral rich bamboo sap, which might explain the reasoning behind its silky, gel-lotion texture. RELATED:\u00a023 Best Skincare Products That Will Give You the Most Amazing Skin of Your Life It's a given that sheet face masks are messy and slippery because they're usually drenched in an abundance of essences and serums. But our Lab experts noticed that this particular sheet mask was saturated with a less-than-average amount of serum, making it less messy, thus\u00a0scoring high for application. Consumers also\u00a0gave this sheet mask the highest score overall for moisturization. You can get this bundle right on Amazon, where it boasts a 4.5 star rating and over 17,000 reviews. It includes 16 various face\u00a0masks, all of which\u00a0aim to build collagen and\u00a0help the skin appear clear and elastic.\u00a0A\u00a0couple of Amazon reviewers in their mid-40s claimed to see change in texture and brightness after use. This mousse mask might just be the ultimate treatment for clogged pores.\u00a0\"It combines exfoliant acids,\u00a0volcanic ash, and kaolin clay to remove dirt and impurities while also clearing older cells and bringing about new healthy ones,\" says Dr. Chimento. It's a great choice for those who have combination or oily skin. Formulated with highly concentrated mineral water, this overnight face mask packs a punch of moisture to dehydrated skin. \"This mask leaves my skin dewy, nourished, and so smooth in the morning,\"\u00a0writes one reviewer. It has a thinner and looser consistency compared to masks and easily absorbs into the skin. If you're dealing with textured skin, this mask claims to go deep within the pores to help refine, smooth and resurface the skin. It aims to optimize skin cell turnover and brighten it for a fresh and clean look. Note that this mask is strong, and online reviewers report feeling subtle stinging during use. Make sure to use with sunscreen. This cult-favorite mask is loved for its multi-use efforts: It hydrates with hyaluronic acid and gently exfoliates with alpha-hydroxy acids. Even Dr. Chimento is a fan:\u00a0\"You can leave this one on to sleep or wash it\u00a0off after 10-20 minutes,\" she tells us.\u00a0\"It is super soothing and will help brighten your face.\" If you have sensitive skin, Dr. Chimento recommends using the mask\u00a0as a wash-off. Online reviewers like the lightweight yet hydrating feel of this mask so much that they'll use it in place of a moisturizer. Reviewers also love that this mask is cheaper than most Korean face masks, though some wish the tube contained more product. The mask uses rice extract to soften, brighten and moisturize the skin. Highly-rated on Sephora, this sheet mask works to help combat breakouts and reduce blemishes. It's formulated with salicylic acid, tea tree oil and niacinamide to help diminish shine.\u00a0One online reviewer comments, \"This mask really helps with calming\u00a0redness and hyperpigmentation.\" \"This is a great product to simply moisturize the skin intensively while you sleep to help your skin look more plump and glowing,\" says Dr. Frieling. It soothes and moisturizes the skin\u00a0using fermented forest yeast, which the brand claims as almost 12% more effective compared to madecassoside. Dehydration, poor diet, or even weather can contribute to dull-looking skin. This $6 mask uses ingredients like bilberry and licorice extract to give your skin a boost. \"Every time I use this, my skin looks like I got a fresh facial \u2014 so hydrated, plump, and bright,\" says one happy online reviewer. It's a bit pricey, but this peeling mask does wonders for exfoliating and getting rid of unwanted texture. Dr. Frieling is a fan herself, saying, \"It's great for removing dead skin\u00a0and smoothing out the texture of that top layer. The papaya enzymes act as an excellent\u00a0exfoliating ingredient.\" No matter if you want to firm, soothe, rejuvenate, or detox, this face mask set has something for you. Each mask helps restore hydration while treating a specific skin issue for glowing skin.\u00a0Plus, all masks come in fun packaging and make fun gifts or individual stocking stuffers. This luxury pick is formulated with serums and a blend of crushed herbs that work to hydrate, soothe and smooth the skin. It's the perfect choice for those seeking to replenish moisture and bounce for a fuller and brighter look.\u00a0\"Once the face mask is absorbed, the skin rises like a phoenix, more supple and hydrated than before,\"\u00a0says Dr. Chimento. Vitamin C\u00a0is a good ingredient to help boost brightness and fade hyper pigmentation or scarring. This sheet mask set is packed with Vitamin C-rich fruit ingredients like\u00a0pomegranate and mulberry extracts that help protect the skin. You receive five sheets in each box. Sagging skin and fine lines are natural, but certain products can help slow down the aging process. This quirky pig mask contains a rich formula of gold extract, collagen, squalene, and honey extract \u2014 all of which help\u00a0firm and hydrate while promoting youthful skin.
