    "text": "(Skin) It\u2019s truly a dreamland. Asian skin care has officially taken the world by storm. Just consider the fact that the hashtag #Kbeauty has over 2 billion views on TikTok. Many buzzy skin care trends that pick up traction on the internet have origins in rich Asian medicinal traditions (think: dunking your face in ice water). While beauty retailers like Sephora, Ulta, and more specifically Soko Glam provide an online and IRL shopping introduction to Asian beauty brands, there is so much more to be discovered. Spread throughout the U.S. are brick and mortar hidden gem stores containing some of the best Asian brands from buzzy names like Laneige, Beauty of Joseon, Sulwhasoo, to more lowkey finds like Banila Co. and IOPE. These brands, have cultural ties that focus on ancient traditions and incorporate holistic beauty practices including the use of herbal ingredients within their products. Beauty of Joseon for example, uses ingredients (like mung beans, plums, and ginseng) that date back to the Joseon Dynasty, hence the name.
