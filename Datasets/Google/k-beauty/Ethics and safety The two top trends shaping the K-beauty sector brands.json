According to Mintel data, 55% of South Korean Gen-Z consumers worry about climate change, making it their third biggest worry behind economy and terrorism. Fuelled by issues like the plastic crisis, Lee believes South Korean personal care players will follow the lead of western brands like Ren, Seed Phytonutrients and UpCircle which champion eco-ethical ideals. The demand for green, however, may lead to confusion in the market, said Lee. \u201cConsumers\u2019 perspective on green beauty is that it can be organic, natural or even non-toxic. They can\u2019t really distinguish, they just know it all [relates] to green beauty.\u201d\u200b He continued: \u201cWe see that there\u2019s a need for a simple explanation of what green beauty is. In the future, green beauty will become a holistic message of sustainability. Beauty brands will be required to show how, where and by whom the products are being created.\u201d\u200b Lee highlighted beauty brand Kahina Giving beauty as an example. The company uses Moroccan argan oil as its key ingredient and gives back to the local community by hiring women to give them financial and social independence. Another major beauty trend that is gaining momentum is the free-from trend. Lee believes the trend is closely tied to rising skin sensitivity concerns in South Korea \u201cAccording surveys, majority of South Korean people say they have sensitive skin, which is why they have a lot of concern over the safety of beauty products,\u201d \u200bsaid Lee. He added that this was leading to \u2018chemical phobia\u2019. \u201cConsumers are running away from chemicals because they fear it will harm their skin. You can say it\u2019s more of a mental thing.\u201d\u200b Like the previous trend, chemical-phobia is being spurred on by highly-publicised issues, such as Hawaii\u2019s decision to ban the sale of sunscreens that contain oxybenzone and octinoxate beginning 2021. \u201cThis year, the state of Florida announced that it will be introducing the same ban. We see such bans to continue expanding,\u201d \u200bsaid Lee. The men's grooming market is the new growth engine for the beauty industry and it\u2019s the same in South Korea. \u201cThis is largely affected by South Korean television, film and K-pop. [Celebrity] style has greatly influenced the men\u2019s make-up trend. This kind of look is not just aimed at younger consumers, but the general male population.\u201d\u200b When it comes to hair care, hair loss and scalp care will continue to trend in the South Korean market. \u201cWe found that consumers are really concerned about it. Any product that is tailored to hair loss or micro-dust is driving interest in the South Korean market,\u201d\u200b said Lee. He added that products with scalp claims, in particular, were growing in popularity. In 2018, 41% of hair care launches made scalp claims. \u201cThis claim is most popular in shampoos and treatments. Additionally, scalp care beauty devices are an area we must closely watch in the future.\u201d\u200b Lee believes colour cosmetics with long-lasting claims will continue to be in great demand. These have outpaced the global average in the last four years and the gap is increasing. In 2018, a notable 61.5% of lip products in launched in Korea made this claim. \u201cWith more busy lifestyles, less time for make-up and the rise of outdoor activities, we expect this trend to continue growing at a very fast pace in the future. A play in this segment is very essential,\u201d \u200bhe concluded. Hectic urban lifestyles is also seeing the emergence of beauty products that centre on getting a good night\u2019s sleep, said Lee. \u201cSleep will become a key word for the future of K-beauty. We\u2019ve already seen Etude House launch a whole series of products to help consumers get quality sleep.\u201d\u200b While Lee believes there are plenty of opportunities in the South Korean beauty market, he admits that K-beauty is facing strong competition from neighbouring Japan. \u201cJapanese beauty companies are growing very well, much stronger than before. When you think about the global perspective, J-beauty has more qualities that resonate with today's consumer,\u201d \u200bsaid Lee. He concluded: \u201cObviously, K-beauty has its own strengthen in term of innovation and marketing, but in terms of Asian beauty perspective I think South Korean companies have to consider the growth of J-beauty in the future.\u201d\u200b Copyright - Unless otherwise stated all contents of this web site are \u00a9 2023 - William Reed Ltd - All Rights Reserved - Full details for the use of materials on this site can be found in the Terms & Conditions Related topics\nMarket Trends\nEast Asia\nVoice of the Industry\nAsia in Focus\nSkin Care\nHair Care\nColor Cosmetics\nFragrance Show more  Content provided by Naolys | 07-Jul-2023\n                     | White Paper Naolys presents HairRevive [MM+Zn], a pioneering plant-based ingredient revitalizing hair.
