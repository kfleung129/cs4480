President of KOTRA Kwon Jeong-Oh recently announced that Swiss department store chain Manor had established a Korean Cosmetics Pavillion in its new branch in the Swiss capital of Bern. \u201cThanks to the proliferation of Hallyu (Korean Wave) in Europe, our small and medium-sized cosmetic companies were introduced to Manor, Switzerland's largest department store.\u201d\u200b South Korean male beauty brand, Grafen, is expanding its presence in SEA after successfully growing its presences in Korea with the help of video commerce.\u200b With its marketing savvy, the brand managed to grow by 80% from 2017 to 2018. \u201cWe didn\u2019t become a well-known brand in a day. It took more than seven or eight years since we started the brand,\u201d\u200b said Jeff Yoon, the brand\u2019s senior marketing director. Yoon said the firm was very aware that they had to focus on building up brand awareness from the start. \u201cThe conventional way of doing business is to go through a franchise or a wholesaler, but we have a different approach of going online first. But we did not focus on just selling products. We wanted to build the brand name in Korea.\u201d\u200b Beauty retailer Sephora has announced its ambitions to expand further into the Asia Pacific market by entering Korea,\u200b New Zealand and making a comeback in Hong Kong. The LVMH-owned firm plans to unveil its news stores in all three markets by the end of 2019. Sephora Asia has over 3,000 stores globally and currently operates in twelve countries including Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, China and Thailand. The company said adding Hong Kong, Korea and New Zealand to its business is \u201ca testament to its appetite for international beauty in the region\u201d\u200b The rise of minimalism is creating opportunities for beauty companies to create simple products to cater to South Korean consumers that are looking for more straightforward beauty routines\u200b. The minimalist trend is driven by young urbanites who are beginning to embrace a simpler lifestyle to combat everyday stress. \u201cA growing number of younger consumers have started to embrace a minimalist lifestyle to give themselves space to breathe as well as take a rest from anything that may be pressurising, even if just slightly,\u201d \u200bsaid Hwa Jun Lee, senior beauty and personal care analyst at Mintel. These consumers, he continues, are happier when buying \u2018just the essentials\u2019. South Korean beauty conglomerate LG Household & Healthcare has collaborated with top Korean dance studio 1Million to launch an online exclusive beauty brand\u200b for the millennial generation. The new brand, Million Beauty, was launched on May 9 with a star-studded bash including entertainers such as actors Yim Eun Kyung and Yeo Hyeon Hyun. Million Beauty is an online exclusive brand with a line-up that consists of five products including a face cream, face mist and cushion foundation. The company said the brand will showcase \u201ccosmetics with proven functions and effects\u201d\u200b \u201cMillion Beauty is a sensational beauty brand for millions who want to deny uniformity of 'beauty', enjoy their own life and express their beauty,\u201d \u200bsaid the company in a statement.
