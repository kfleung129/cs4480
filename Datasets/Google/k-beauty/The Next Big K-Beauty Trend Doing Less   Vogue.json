While it has become synonymous with the admittedly intimidating 10-step skincare routine, the latest K-beauty trend is now turning our attention to a more minimal practice that might better suit busier lifestyles: Say hello to skip-care. \u201cPeople lead really busy lives and skincare technology is constantly evolving,\u201d says Peach & Lily founder Alicia Yoon. \u201cK-beauty in particular is always looking for the newest innovations\u2014part of that is efficiency.\u201d Skip-care is a consolidated skincare routine that consists of multi-tasking products; a reaction to the idea of an overly complicated multi-step routine. \u201cThere's a lot of general misconceptions that a 10 to 15-step routine is a must in Korean beauty rituals,\u201d says co-founder and co-CEO of Glow Recipe Christine Chang. \u201cInstead of counting the number of steps, the true approach to skincare is more about being receptive to your skin\u2019s condition and customizing your routine according to how your skin feels that day, which is very much in line with the philosophy behind skip-care.\u201d Chang\u2019s business partner, co-founder and co-CEO of Glow Recipe Sarah Lee, agrees. \u201c[It\u2019s] all about focusing on what your skin truly needs and getting rid of any excess,\u201d says Lee. \u201cIt\u2019s not about sacrificing good ingredients or necessary steps. Instead, maximize the products and application methods you use in your routine to get amazing results.\u201d Lee says to look for \u201chybrid products\u201d that can cut out the number of steps in a routine without sacrificing efficacy. For a cleanser, she suggests looking for a product with soothing and hydrating ingredients. Instead of cluttering your routine with tons of toners and serums, she says to find one nourishing toner that you can layer multiple times with ease. For the last step, she picks a sleeping mask that works overnight so you wake up with brighter and healthier skin. This doesn\u2019t mean that the 10-step skincare routine is now extinct. All three women agree that both routines will still give you desired skin results\u2014it\u2019s all about what works for your skin and lifestyle. \u201cIt's all about personalization,\u201d says Yoon. \u201cWe see longer routines remain popular as people see great results by hand-selecting products that work well together for their comprehensive skin needs.\u201d But for those who choose to pare down their routine, skip-care has the added benefit of making beauty more sustainable, simply by reducing the number of packages required.
