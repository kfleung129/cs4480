Moving into the make-up arena with its first \u2018character beauty shop\u2019 in Tokyo Station this summer - an area that houses Pok\u00e9mon games -\u00a0Bandai is introducing tourists to child-focused low and high-end cosmetics ranges. The store, \u2018Otona Joshi Biyori\u2019 (which translates as \u2018A fine day for adult girls\u2019), houses international popular characters like Hello Kitty, The Rose of Versailles, Rascal the Raccoon, Bonobono, and Sailor Moon. The ranges are comprised of lip balms and skin brightening \u2018magical ball\u2019 face powders wrapped in vibrant and playful packaging. Sailor Moon related beauty is particularly tipped to see success as the remake of the TV series in recent years has been dubbed into dozens of languages. In Asia, TV series and dramas have a major influence in make-up trends and purchasing behaviour. Kawaii trend\u200b Kawaii \u2013 also known as the \u2018adorableness\u2019 trend - is catching on internationally. One brand fronting the movement, Asia\u00a0Kawaii Way, launched 'Face Toyko'\u00a0cosmetics boxes to share popular make-up products and techniques from Tokyo with the rest of the world in 2015. The \u2018adorableness\u2019\u00a0boxes\u00a0were inspired by the 2,000 attendees at Tokyo Girls Collection and are comprised of four different looks; the fresh 'Raw Face', the 'Adorable Doll Face', the 'Heritage Bitter Face' and the trend-driven 'Colour Face'. The range has since been picked up by Japanese retailers, including Matsumoto Kiyoshi, Tsuruha Drug and Don Quijote.
