    "title": " The Best K-Beauty Products For A Full-Fledged Korean Skincare Routine",
    "text": "Korean beauty, also popular as K-beauty, is known for its signature multistep skincare routine featuring the best of ingredients. While most of us are familiar with these rituals, we don\u2019t necessarily know which products have the right ingredients and give the best results. To make things simpler, we tested a whole bunch of them, and found the following to be the best in each category. The next time you have to shop for good skincare, refer to this list for recommendations! Table of Contents Image credit: Beauty Barn India Price: Rs 1,650 Skincare begins with double cleansing, and an oil-based cleanser is crucial for breaking down sunscreen and makeup. A cult favourite cleansing balm, this removes heavy, stubborn makeup without much effort, and makes cleansing much easier. Just massage the balm gently on your skin, and rinse it off with lukewarm water. Buy it here. Image credit: Sublime Life India Price: Rs 850 If you have \u201cproblem\u201d skin, a gentle cleanser does a world of good, unlike a soapy one that strips the skin dry and damages the barrier. This product is pH balanced, so it doesn\u2019t mess with your skin\u2019s acid mantle, thereby negating the damage caused by most alkaline cleansers. Buy it here. Image credit: Nykaa Price: Rs 1,100 Super effective in purifying the skin, this is the holy grail of clay masks, although it\u2019s technically made of volcanic ash. Specifics aside, it makes dull and grimy skin look clean and removes excess grease and dead skin more efficiently than other clay masks can. Buy it here. Image credit: Maccaron India Price: Rs 1,899 Korean skincare is big on hydration. A hydrating toner helps the skin absorb other skincare products you apply afterwards, like a serum or a moisturiser. Perfect for all skin types, this toner is gently hydrating, and doesn\u2019t dry out the skin like harsh astringents. So, your skin feels like it has had a tall drink of water, and isn\u2019t coated with a layer of oily residue. What makes it even better is that it doesn\u2019t have any fragrance, ensuring it works beautifully on sensitive skin. Buy it here. Image credit: Maccaron India Price: Rs 1,750 While the variety of exfoliants in this product might seem intimidating, it is a well-balanced offering which improves the skin texture. Not meant to be used everyday-- as any other exfoliant -- it is great for treating acne, be it whiteheads, blackheads, cystic acne or just bumps. It removes all that excess dead skin and makes the skin look shiny, like you just got a facial. Just remember to use a good SPF the next day! Buy it here. Image credit: Nykaa Price: Rs 100 This sheet mask is a cult favourite, and is nearly always sold out. While most sheet masks are not potent enough to make a visible difference to the skin, this is an exception. It genuinely helps acne scars fade, and helps repair the skin barrier. If you keep the serum of the mask on overnight, the effects are even better the next day, and you\u2019ll see your skin glow from within. . Buy it here. Image credit: Beauty Barn India Price: Rs 1,450 This product is widely-recommended and very popular because of how effective it is in protecting the skin barrier, hydrating the skin, and strengthening it. It is ideal for damaged skin, be it dry or combination skin battling with acne. It helps calm the inflammation, and heals broken skin in the long run. While it may seem quite viscous at first application, the product is easily absorbed, and doesn\u2019t feel oily. However, it can feel a bit heavy on oily skin. Buy it here. Image credit: Sublime Life India Price: Rs 1,570 One of the most effective Vitamin C serums ever made, this is a holy grail K-beauty product for a reason. It works really well in reducing blemishes left by acne, and is great for evening out the skin tone. However, since the bottle comes in a clear packaging, storing it in a cool dark place, preferably inside the paper box it comes in, is crucial. If you don\u2019t follow that, the product will go bad before you\u2019re halfway through the bottle. Buy it here. Image credit: Maccaron India Price: Rs 1,399 While the packaging of this product looks like it was inspired by the \u201cKeep Calm & Carry On\u201d memes, this product is too good to not be taken seriously. The lightweight product quenches dehydrated skin, plumps it up, and doesn\u2019t leave a sticky residue. Perfect for sensitive skin, this fragrance-free lotion is probably the most underrated Korean moisturiser. If you want that \u201cglass skin\u201d glow synonymous with K-beauty, this is just the product you need. Buy it here. Image credit: Maccaron India Price: Rs 1,650 Most eye creams, even thick ones, don\u2019t keep the under eye area hydrated beyond a certain point, and get soaked up by the skin to disappear. With this cream, the under eye region feels moisturised for a long time, and not dehydrated, also imparting a fresh and smooth appearance. Buy it here. Image credit: Nykaa Price: Rs 2,070 While the brand\u2019s water sleeping mask is quite famous, the Cica variation does some heavy-duty damage repair worth writing about. Unlike the former, it is a thick product, so it may feel heavy on oily skin, especially during the summer. Still, it doesn\u2019t have a particularly oily texture. Unlike many sleeping masks, it isn't sticky and gets absorbed into the skin easily. Additionally, it heals acne scars and damaged patches of skin in a matter of days. Buy it here. Image credit: Nykaa Price: Rs 1,150 At first glance, it seems wild to pay that much money for a lip balm. However, this thick product is formulated in such a way that a full size jar will last for at least six to eight months upon regular use, if not more. One swipe of this smoothes away all the cracks and flakes, and provides a rich layer of protection to the lips. We also like the fact that it comes with a spatula, so you can scoop out the amount of product needed, instead of dipping your fingertips in it. Most importantly, few other lip balms are this nourishing, so it is definitely in a league of its own. Buy it here. Image credit: Nykaa Price: Rs 1,490 Skin-quenching and hydrating, this is like the Korean alternative to the Japanese favourite, Biore Aqua UV Essence. It is really lightweight and refreshing, which makes it feel like a skin-soothing moisturiser instead of a typical sunblock. The best part is, it doesn\u2019t leave a white cast like most K-beauty sunscreens. However, the price could be an issue, especially as the Biore sunscreen is now available in India at a lesser price for the same quantity. Buy it here.
