    "text": "\"We want to create more experiential offerings for our community.\" Beauty Editor, Finance Peach & Lily has its first big investor \u2014 Sandbridge Capital, which also backs Derek Lam and Youth to the People. Peach & Lily was founded in 2012 by Alicia Yoon as a means to bring Korean-beauty trends into the U.S. market. The business also has two owned brands \u2014 Peach & Lily, a prestige brand that makes products like Glass Skin Refining Serum for $39, and Peach Slices, a mass brand sold at CVS. It also acts as a third-party distributor to certain brands. Sandbridge has taken a minority stake in the business. Yoon said the influx of capital should allow Peach & Lily to start expanding internationally, particularly in Europe. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really raise the capital because we needed the capital. This is year eight of the business and this is our first institutional partner,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wanted a strategic growth investment.
