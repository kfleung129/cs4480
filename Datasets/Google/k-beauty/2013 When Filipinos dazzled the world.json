MANILA, Philippines \u2013 It\u2019s been a year of happy memories \u2013 despite the devastation. For beauty pageant enthusiasts, 2013 will be most remembered as the year when we reigned. Rappler\u2019s Life and Style Section compiles its biggest news from the year that\u2019s about to end. Year of Filipina beauty  After coming on top in 3 beauty pageants, the Philippines made its mark as the \u201ccountry of the year,\u201d besting constant frontrunner Venezuela. The year 2013 saw Filipina beauties conquer the Miss World, Miss Supranational and Miss International pageants: Watch Rappler\u2019s interview with Miss World 2013 Megan Young here:  Aside from the top winners, other beauty queens from the Philippines also placed in several different pageants. The Philippines joined the pageant world\u2019s \u201cBig Four\u201d\u00a0this year, and surpassed Venezuela, a country famous for regularly producing beauty queens but which failed to place in Miss International in 2013.\u00a0(Venezuela has won the Miss Universe crown 6 times and Miss World 5 times). Bea Rose Santiago\u2019s win in Miss International was made more sentimental by her 30-second speech in the final round, which she dedicated to her kababayan\u00a0affected Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan): \u201cThe whole world saw how my country, the Philippines, suffered. The agony of my people was felt. But one by one, country to country came to help. I would like to thank all the nations that helped my country. In our darkest hours, you have opened my eyes and my heart to how important it is to support each other. If I become Miss International, I will uphold international camaraderie to sustain the spirit of sympathy and to continually share the message of hope. I believe that whatever calamity may come to us, as long as we have each other, there will be hope.\u201d Filipino pride Speaking of a winning streak, it wasn\u2019t just about beauty pageants for us this year. Filipino contestant Jonathan Yabut won in this year\u2019s The Apprentice (Asia).

As they left the hospital on July 23, Prince William told reporters: \u201cI\u2019ll have to remind him of his tardiness when he\u2019s older, I know you\u2019ve all been out here waiting a long time.\u201d Prince George is third in line to the British throne. Controversial, honest opinions  In August, a guest columnist for Rappler sparked online controversy after publishing her honest, tongue-in-cheek piece on one-night stands. Janina Suarez\u2019 (not her real name) article was seen by some as liberating, and by others as offensive. The online reactions gave birth to her second piece \u2013 another true, straight-to-the-point essay about what really defines a woman.\u00a0Love her or hate her, Janina\u2019s honesty and spunk make her a winner. Loss and heartbreak In October, a 7.2-magnitude earthquake shook Bohol, Cebu, and other parts of the Visayas and Mindanao. The earthquake flattened schools, homes, small buildings \u2013 and even churches that were built were hundreds of years ago. Loboc, Dauis, Baclayon, and Loay churches were among those that were heavily damaged.
