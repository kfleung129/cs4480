But with so many beauty products launched this 2022, we\u2019ve made it easier for you to pick from our list below\u2014for your besties and even for yourself! Who doesn\u2019t want clear spot-free skin? Ever Bilena Plus 5% Niacinamide + Zinc Refining Serum, P395, promises to deliver smoother skin texture and lighten dark spots. Zinc helps keep sebum production at the bay with its anti-inflammatory properties, lessening acne, too! Let\u2019s face it! Environmental pollutants and skin aggressors will always be there, and we just have to deal with it. Ever Bilena Plus Ceramide Barrier Sealing Cream 30ml, P395, works for our tropical weather with its lightweight moisturizing cream that\u2019s packed with hyaluronic acid, panthenol, shea butter, and ceramides. All of these help to lock in moisturize, reduce fine lines, soothe redness, soften and repair skin damage, and strengthen the skin\u2019s protective barrier. Have fun coming up with different looks with Spotlight Cosmetics Scene Stealer 8-in-1 Eye Palette, P495.

This palette can also be used to fill in brows, contour, highlight, and even add color to your cheeks. Best of all, it comes with a mirror for application on-the-go. With parties and reunions left and right, our skin is subject to more layers of long-wearing and transfer-proof makeup products this month. We don\u2019t want to keep retouching, right? But this leaves us with the tiring task of taking them out before we go to bed. Careline Skin Gentle Jelly Cleanser, P285, is a mild cleanser that is up for the challenge of even taking out waterproof makeup products. With aloe vera and centella asiatica extracts, this cleanser leaves your skin moisturized and hydrated\u2013even after cleansing.

This lightweight gel formula reacts to your lips\u2019 acidity levels, creating a shade that\u2019s made for you. Vitamin E and other antioxidants keep your puckers healthy, moisturized, and plump.

Bring out the fun and creative side in you with Carline Colored Ink Liner, P195. Line your upper and lower lids with fun colors of brown, pink, red, green, yellow, and white. Feeling more confident? Its flexible tip lets you go for geometric shapes on your upper lids, and it\u2019s smudge-free, too! Stand out from the crowd with Careline Graph-Ink Liner, P220. This intense-black hue helps you achieve that bold, sexy, mysterious cat-lined eyes. Long-lasting, transfer and waterproof, you don\u2019t have to worry with retouches.

It\u2019s quick to dry and delivers natural and rosy cheeks for that dalagang Pilipina look.

Let them (or you) live out their K-drama dreams with Ever Organics Serum Sheet Mask, P38, which they can put on while watching their favorite shows. With so many variants to choose from, you can give them one of each without breaking the bank. Another skincare set inspired by K-beauty brands, Hello Glow Blemish Miracle Set, P360, is perfect for those who want to keep a good skincare routine.
