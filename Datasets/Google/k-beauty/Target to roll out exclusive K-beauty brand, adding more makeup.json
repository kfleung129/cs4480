The big-box retailer earlier this week unveiled an exclusive brand, building on its successes online, that's about to hit the market. The collection, called Glow Studio, will feature four-step routine kits that simplify a typical 10-step Korean beauty regimen, making it more accessible to users. In launching Glow Studio, Target is working with e-commerce site and Korean beauty expert Glow Recipe. K-beauty products have rapidly grown in popularity across the U.S., as they're known for using unique ingredients like green tea and chai tea to cleanse and hydrate skin. In Korea, beauty routines are more focused on prevention rather than treating issues like acne or wrinkles, Target explained in its blog post. \"K-Beauty is one of the fastest growing categories in premium skincare at Target,\" Mark Tritton, Target's chief merchandising officer, said in a press release. \"This Target-exclusive collection allows our guests to effortlessly incorporate K-Beauty products into their beauty regimen, all for an incredible price,\" Tritton added. \"It's also another great example of how we're partnering with digital brands who are experts in their field to curate a selection of compelling products conveniently for our guests at Target.\" Glow Studio will hit stores and Target.com starting on Sunday, at prices ranging from $5 to $38, Target said. The collection will introduce an exclusive line of green and chai tea recipe skin care products, as well as products from Make P:rem and LJH, which are both recognized K-beauty brands. Target has recently signed deals with other online brands, including Casper, for mattresses, and BARK, for subscription boxes of dog treats and toys. Earlier this year, Target announced plans to launch 12 private-label brands in the coming months. Four of those new brands \u2014 A New Day, Goodfellow & Co., JoyLab and Project 62 \u2014 are in the midst of rolling out to stores by this fall. Target will now embark on growing its beauty offerings at a time when players like Ulta and Sephora are expanding their physical footprints across the U.S., as the beauty business looks to be a brighter part of retail's narrative. Notably, Glow Studio is not considered one of Target's 12 coming private-label brands, but is another unique digital partnership for the company. Got a confidential news tip?
