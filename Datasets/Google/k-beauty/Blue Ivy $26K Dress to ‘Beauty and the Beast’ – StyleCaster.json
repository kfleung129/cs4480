There we were, minding our own business on a sunny Monday in New York City, when we came across some pics of\u00a0Beyonc\u00e9\u00a0and\u00a0Blue Ivy\u00a0heading off to the\u00a0Beauty and the Beast\u00a0premiere\u00a0at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood. OK, no problem so far. The mom-and-daughter duo looked adorable, and Bey is definitely rocking a pregnancy glow (serious question: does having twins double the glow?), and \u2026 Blue Ivy was wearing a $26,000 dress. Wait, wait, wait. Pause.\u00a0What?! As E! News pointed out, Blue Ivy\u2019s Gucci dress appears to be a modified version of a seriously pricy number available on Net-a-Porter right now, and though it\u2019s highly likely that Blue got to twirl around in the dress for free (as\u00a0a loan or a gift), if anyone wants to emulate the five-year-old\u2019s look, they\u2019re going to have to fork over some serious cash.  Of course, this is not the first time Blue has stepped out wearing designer, and it certainly won\u2019t be her last. And, hey, if you\u2019re a celeb and you can wear an exorbitantly priced item to an event without having to pay for it, we get it\u2014sounds fun. Then again, call us crazy, but we\u2019d be down to see little Blue wearing something more tailored to, say, the average five-year-old. Blue Ivy was wearing a pair of white converse, though! And Jay Z\u00a0went Gucci too, wearing a version of a $5,000 jacket for the night out. So, the moral of this story\u2014the family that wears Gucci together stays together, maybe?
