    "text": "NEWS... BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT We recently reported on the launch of a new collection by Lacura at Aldi, all inspired by K-beauty brands like Laneige. The range featured a whole host of skincare products in pastel colours, claiming to be dupes of Korean favourites. From the Glow Recipe-esque pineapple serum to the Laneige-style night mask, we gave everything from the line a go. Although we love a dupe, the proof is always in the formula, so we put those formulas to the test. Here are our reviews: The eye cream is pillowy, comforting and makes me feel like my skin is really being well protected at night. I love that it has retinol as the active ingredient, so I know it will be working on those crows feet. Rating: 4/5 This serum smells literally so good I want to eat it. It\u2019s really nice for an added hit of moisture if you feel like your skin is a bit dry, or if you want a boost of dewiness before putting on make-up, but it doesn\u2019t seem to last as long as other serums I have for my face. Rating: 3/5 Again this smells ridiculously edible. I love how bouncy and almost gel-like this moisturiser is, I feel like it creates a brilliant protective barrier for my skin \u2013 but I\u2019m not sure that it sinks in quite as deeply as other moisturiser. It\u2019s best if you\u2019re looking for a lighter product. Rating: 3/5 Not to be a party pooper, but this didn\u2019t totally do it for me. It\u2019s a night mask you wear over your usual moisturiser that should see you waking with plump and moisturised skin. This feels nice on the skin, but if I\u2019m honest, I found the gel texture wasn\u2019t occlusive enough, and I still woke up feeling a little tight in certain areas. Rating: 2/5 This 'thickening' scalp treatment has got shopper's hair 'growing like wildfire' Where to buy the cheapest frozen turkey this year as Aldi hikes price by 20% This Aldi favourite will keep you warm this winter \u2014 and costs just 2p an hour to run The new Lacura lip balms I tried have a beautiful texture, going on like a non-sticky gloss that coats the lips as well as hydrating them. I tried all three \u2013 pear, grapefruit, and cherry \u2013 and can confirm they all smell delicious and provide the same healthy, plumped finish. Not to mention, at that price point I\u2019m not worried I\u2019ll lose it and waste a load of cash. Rating: 5/5 Do you have a story you\u2019d like to share?
