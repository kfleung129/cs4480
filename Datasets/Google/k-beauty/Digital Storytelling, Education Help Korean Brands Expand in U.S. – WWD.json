    "text": "Glow Recipe and AmorePacific are both using digital media to take Korean skin-care brands to new markets. Beauty Editor, Finance For brands looking to capitalize on the popularity of Korean skin care, digital storytelling and tech-enabled education are keys to success. \u201cThe explosion of the K beauty market is really possible because of the exchange of information,\u201d says Dan Jee, director of digital marketing and e-commerce at AmorePacific.\u201cInformation-sharing is so rapid.\u201d Take, for example, Glow Recipe, a business founded by former L\u2019Or\u00e9al marketer Sarah Lee and cofounder Christine Chang in 2014 when they saw an opportunity to take brands beloved by Koreans and translate them for the U.S. market. The strategy includes education, sometimes renaming or re-branding products and a constant dialogue with customers through social media channels like Snapchat and Instagram, or e-mail.  On one of Lee\u2019s frequent trips for Korea, she encountered aqua peeling, a gentle exfoliating process that can be handled during a lunch break. To amp up awareness of the new process, Lee had the Glow Recipe team write a \u201cdeep-dive\u201d blog post to show why aqua peeling is relevant to American consumers. \u201cAqua peeling popped up in five major digital media outlets,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWithin two weeks the whole inventory was sold out.\u201d Other products, especially ones with unfamiliar product names or descriptions, require a different approach. Glow Recipe renamed \u201cmodeling packs,\u201d calling them rubber masks, and changed \u201cpatting water packs\u201d to splash masks. Plus, they modified\u00a0the splash mask formulation \u2014 which originates from a basin filled with rice steep water that Korean women pat onto their faces \u2014 so it could be used in the shower. \u201cI think Americans are less inclined to fill up the basin, so we came up with the splash mask term,\u201d Lee said.

Part of that process stems from product ingredients. \u201cWhen you think about ginseng in America, you don\u2019t think about it as skin care,\u201d Jee says. \u201cHow do we tell people it goes from the ginseng root to really help your skin and health? We want to make sure we use this digital channel as an enabler \u2014 it\u2019s really enabling to really talk about the quality of the products and the quality of the brand story that we want to tell.\u201d Sign up for beauty news straight to your inbox every day Top News Stories Alerts Straight to your Inbox.
