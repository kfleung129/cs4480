    "text": "Discover Thomson Reuters By Hyun Young Yi, Josh Smith 3 Min Read SEOUL (Reuters) - From tutorials on how to wear makeup with a face mask, to hats that incorporate a protective plastic face shield, South Koreans are seeking to make sure the coronavirus outbreak doesn\u2019t damage their reputation for style. In one video that has gathered tens of thousands of views, 29-year-old beauty YouTuber SSUNZY gives tips for applying makeup in a way that looks good under a mask. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very unfortunate that a mask hides your face,\u201d she says in the video. \u201cYou can\u2019t show off your charm. I\u2019m going to do makeup that makes your face look good even when you\u2019re wearing a mask.\u201d SSUNZY recommends that viewers use more moisturizer, and stick to more natural shades rather than heavy colouring. A hydrating foundation, for example, makes it easier to touch up makeup after removing a mask, she said. Those practices seem to be popular, with sales of more colourful cosmetics falling while sales of skincare products have increased \u201cWe saw an increase in skincare product sales during the month of March compared to the previous month,\u201d said Amorepacific Group, South Korea\u2019s largest cosmetics powerhouse. \u201cAnti-aging products show the most stable sales.\u201d The ubiquitousness of face masks has made them an everyday fashion item for South Koreans, with K-pop music stars helping spread their popularity. \u201cThe public has become more comfortable with them as a countermeasure (to coronavirus) because G-Dragon wears them, BTS wears them, everybody wears them, so why can\u2019t I wear them?\u201d Korean fashion designer Park Youn-hee, who often works with K-pop idols including BTS and Girls\u2019 Generation, said at her showroom in Seoul while suggesting a fashion style that fits for a face mask. \u201cTo us, and to K-fashion, the mask is a signature item.\u201d Like many countries, South Korea has faced shortages of face masks. The government has imposed a rationing system to limit the number of masks each person can buy each week and placed export restrictions on masks. In response, some South Koreans have turned to other ways of combining protection and fashion. One item seen for sale in shops and online are hats with a clear plastic face shield. People of all ages have been seen wearing the hat in Daegu, the centre of South Korea\u2019s coronavirus outbreak. \u201cIt goes well with all casual clothing,\u201d Park said of the hats. South Korea has reported over 8,500 confirmed cases of coronavirus. Park said people should embrace some of the anonymity provided by masks and push the boundaries of their personal style. \u201cI think a mask is an item that can give you confidence since people don\u2019t recognise you clearly,\u201d she said. \u201cTry bold colours and different looks.\u201d Reporting by Hyun Young Yi and Josh Smith.
