Henry Lau of K-Pop boy band Super Junior-M performs in Seoul, South Korea. Clinton Lau still has difficulty wrapping his mind around the fact that his younger brother, a former Torontonian, is a celebrity overseas. \u201cHe has fans following him 24 hours a day, they take shifts and follow him in taxis,\u201d he says, disbelief in his voice.  Twenty-four-year-old Henry Lau was plucked from his Willowdale home a few years back and has since been made into one of Asia\u2019s biggest K-Pop sensations, playing the violin in Super Junior-M, a Korean boy band signed with Korean label S.M. Entertainment. K-Pop, a genre of dance music that fuses sugar pop, EDM, and American hip hop and R&B, is South Korea\u2019s hottest cultural export. The country\u2019s top three labels earned a record $160 million in 2011 by reaching beyond their own borders. Before Lau auditioned for S.M. Entertainment, an Asian music agency that scouts talent and trains artists intensively for years to become Asia\u2019s hottest music stars, he was just a Grade 12 kid, wowing his family and friends at talent shows. \u201cHe just had a really amazing sense of showmanship that set him apart,\u201d Clinton Lau says. Jonathan Medina, the president of a Korean music fan group in Toronto, says it\u2019s unusual that Henry, who he says is equivalent in popularity to a Spice Girl in the \u201990s, has made it so big in the Asian music pop music scene. \u201cThere are a few other Canadians that have been scouted, because the music labels out there come to places like Toronto to find talent, but there aren\u2019t many others who have made it as big as him,\u201d he says. He mentions another Canadian, originally from Edmonton, who goes by the stage name G.NA Choi, who was scouted and is now a successful solo artist in Korea under an Asian label. \u201cBut it\u2019s still really rare that someone from Toronto is living a star life like that,\u201d Medina says. In the Lau household, Henry, Clinton and their little sister were playing the violin and piano at a young age. \u201cMy dad worked in real estate and my mom stayed at home so she was the one who was really enforcing us playing music,\u201d Clinton says, adding that all the kids in the family were taking the Royal Conservatory program for both piano and violin. Henry had always done well in Toronto, often winning competitions, but it wasn\u2019t until he abandoned the classical music route and got inspired by a talent show performance of Michael Jackson at another Toronto high school that he really shone, his brother says. \u201cA friend taught him how to sing and dance, and he learned how to play the violin as well,\u201d Clinton says. In the spring of his Grade 12 year at A.Y. Jackson Secondary School, Henry went with a few friends to an audition for S.M. Entertainment in Toronto, singing, dancing and playing the violin. \u201cThey called him back the next day and my mom thought it was a big scam,\u201d Clinton says, laughing. Executives from S.M. Entertainment had to fly Mrs. Lau and Henry to their headquarters in Korea to meet with the CEO in order for her to believe their claims of wanting to train her son to become a star. \u201cAfter she came back, she was OK with it and he flew out soon after, turning down a spot in the U of T music program,\u201d Clinton says. Shortly after the trip, Henry boarded a plane to superstardom, missing his high school prom. Henry trained for only a few short months before he debuted in 2007 in Super Junior-M, a rare occurrence, his brother says. \u201cSometimes the music label will train people for 10 years before they debut,\u201d Clinton says. Henry was well received and so was the group\u2019s first EP, Super Girl, which was released in 2009. He took a break to study production elements of music at the prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston and returned to Asia in January 2013, just in time for Super Junior-M\u2019s release of its second studio album, Break Down. Clinton says it was Henry\u2019s music production experience that helped him become S.M. Entertainment\u2019s first solo male artist in over a decade when he released his own album in Asia this past month. It is still unclear when the album will be available in Canada. \u201cHenry always joked around, saying he would be a pop star in high school, but we never knew anything like this was possible, not coming from Willowdale,\u201d Clinton says. \u201cI still think it\u2019s kind of unbelievable.\u201d With files from Ryan Porter Anyone can read Conversations, but to contribute, you should be a registered Torstar account holder.
