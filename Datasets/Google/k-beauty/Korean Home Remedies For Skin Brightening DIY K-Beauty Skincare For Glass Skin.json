In many Asian nations such as China and Korea, fermented rice water plays a key role in skincare routines. The best part is it can be made at home. Boil rice, strain and collect water, allow it to cool and store in a spray container. You can also eliminate the boiling process by soaking rice in water overnight and collecting the water the next morning. Allow it to ferment for 2-3 days and then use the fermented rice water as a face mist in the morning and night. Yuzu lemon may be a Japanese ingredient but finds usage in Asian beauty regimes. In K-beauty, it is referred to as yuza and is revered for its citrus pop and antioxidants. Mix 2 drops of yuzu lemon essential oil with 5-6 strawberries mashed to a pulp and 2 tablespoons of fresh yogurt. Apply to your face and neck, let it sit for 30 minutes and wash off with warm water. You'll notice your skin feeling reinvigorated and fresher right after. Brew quarter of a cup of water to make green tea. Allow it to cool completely and use it as final rinse for your face after\u00a0every wash. Green tea, while usually known to work as a detoxifier from the inside, works on blemishes and breakouts from the outside too. Combine 3 tablespoons of finely ground rice flour with 2 tablespoons of aloe vera pulp and cold water in proportion to form a runny liquid. Apply over the face and neck, let it dry for an hour and wash off with cold water. Your skin will feel calm and soothed once you use this face mask.
