    "text": "SINGAPORE (April 30, 2015) \u2013 A record 35 billionaires are on this year\u2019s Forbes\u2019 South Korea Rich List. Most people returning to the list saw their wealth rise, partly due to an 11% increase in Korean stock prices. The complete list can be found here and in the May issues of Forbes Asia and Forbes Korea, the Korean language edition of Forbes. Topping the list again is Samsung Electronics Chairman Lee Kun-Hee, who is the country\u2019s richest man with a net worth of $13.3 billion, up from $12.9 billion a year ago. Lee\u2019s family members also have a strong showing on the list. Lee\u2019s son, Jay Y. Lee, is ranked No. 3 with a net worth of $7.8 billion, and is steering the giant Samsung Group while his father remains in hospital after a heart attack last May. Jay Y. Lee\u2019s sister, Lee Seo-Hyun, saw her wealth soar by 84% (No. 14, $2.25 billion) after the IPO of Cheil Industries. She is the co-president of the firm with her older sister, Lee Boo-Jin (No. 13, $2.3 billion), who is now South Korea\u2019s richest woman. Ranked No. 2 on the list is the Chairman and Chief Executive of AmorePacific, Suh Kyung-Bae, whose wealth more than tripled to $9.2 billion this year. His company\u2019s sales in China are soaring as young women are snapping up its cosmetics products. In addition, the growing popularity of K-beauty is also boosting sales worldwide. AmorePacific\u2019s share price has nearly quadrupled since the beginning of 2014. At No. 4 is Hyundai Motor\u2019s Chung Mong-Koo, who saw his net wealth decrease to $5.6 billion, from $7.1 billion last year. The stronger won, relative to the Yen, has been affecting sales abroad, while a stream of imports is impacting market share locally. His son, Chung Eui-Sun (No. 5, $3.8 billion) also saw his fortune fall by $300 million. This year\u2019s tally produced eight new billionaires, and now the country boasts 35 ten-figure fortunes. Four of them join the list for the first time: Kwon Hyuk-Bin (No. 7), who owes his $3.6 billion net worth to the huge valuation of his privately held online-gaming company, Smilegate; Kim Nam-Jung of Dongwon Group, the company behind South Korea\u2019s famous canned tunas (No. 21, $1.55 billion); construction magnate Kwon Hyuk-Woon (No. 26, $1.28 billion); and convenience store king Hong Seok-Joh (No. 31, $1.13 billion). Another notable billionaire is Cho Jung-Ho, Chairman of Meritz Financial Group and the subject of the cover story in the May issue of Forbes Asia. He debuted at No. 40 on the list last year with a net worth of $640 million and has since jumped 15 spots to reach No. 25 with a net worth of $1.3 billion. Cho inherited an insurer and a securities firm from his father, the patriarch of Hanjin Group. He later broke away from the family business and built a financial powerhouse - the Meritz Financial Group. Other newcomers on the list include: Furniture-maker Cho Chang-Gul (No. 41, $900 million); Hyosung Group President Cho Hyun-Joon (No. 49, $670 million) and Cuckoo Electronics CEO Koo Bon-Hak (No. 50, $665 million). Notable drop-offs are Kang Young-Joong of education company Daekyo and Cho Hyun-Bum, son of Hankook Tire\u2019s Chairman Cho Yang-Rai (No. 37, $980 million). The minimum amount required to make the list was $665 million, up from $515 million last year.
