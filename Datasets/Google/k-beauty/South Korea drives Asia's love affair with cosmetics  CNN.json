In China, cosmetics now outstrips groceries as the biggest selling item in its department stores In 2013, Chinese women, and increasingly men, spent 162.5 billion yuan ($26 billion) on cosmetics Japan's annual beauty and personal care market is still the largest in the region at about $50bn But China's 150 million-strong middle class is closing the gap fast and its focus is increasingly South Korea The cosmetics section of any department store anywhere in the world might usually be the first thing you encounter when you walk through the door, but in China it\u2019s often a mirror maze on a vast and dazzling scale. There are serried ranks of demonstrations as shop assistants jostle for attention armed with French moisturizers, South Korean all-in-one BB creams and Japanese lip glosses and violet eye shadows. If department stores in Asia are the battle ground for its emerging middle classes, then the cosmetics counter is its front line. Big demand In China, cosmetics now outstrips groceries as the biggest selling item in its department stores, according to a report from Fung Business Intelligence Center. In 2013, Chinese women, and increasingly men, spent 162.5 billion yuan ($26 billion) on cosmetics in an industry that showed 13.3% growth year-on-year, according to the same report citing figures from Euromonitor International. Beauty school transforms lives Cosmetics heiress builds lifestyle brand Cosmetics queen's billion-dollar empire Japan\u2019s annual beauty and personal care market is still the largest in the region at about $50 billion, second in the world only to the United States (which is about $70 billion), according to Euromonitor International. But China\u2019s 150 million-strong middle class is closing the gap fast. For them, however, ground zero in terms of models of beauty is increasingly South Korea. While South Korea\u2019s domestic market is only a third the size of China, in terms of soft power the country punches well above its weight thanks to Asia\u2019s insatiable appetite for Korean drama series and their stars. China\u2019s middle class is expected to grow to 500 million within a decade. By 2030 around one billion people in China could be middle class \u2013 as much as 70% of its projected population, according to a report from EY. In terms of brands, according to Euromonitor, L\u2019Or\u00e9al China continued to hold the leading position in the Chinese cosmetics market in 2013 with a value share of 34%. And while South Korean brands might be little known outside the region, thanks to the popularity of K-pop and Korean soap operas \u2013 whose stars such as Song Hye-kyo and Kim Hyun-joong and Yoona of Girls\u2019 Generation are household names in the Asia-Pacific region \u2013 Korean beauty brands are now the hottest ticket item in China. Michelle Phan on South Korean cosmeticsFor make-up guru Michelle Phan, an American entrepreneur and YouTube celebrity, South Korea holds a special attraction for the Asian market.\u201cIn South Korea I was so well received,\u201d Phan told CNN. \u201cThe followers are very passionate; one girl even waited outside my hotel for nine hours.\u201cPeople in Korea want good skin care and less make-up and, on average, a Korean woman will use about nine skincare products a night.\u201d For cosmetic companies, there\u2019s no shortage of variation in the Asian market, with each country preferring its own distinctive look.\u201cBeauty standards in Asia are completely different,\u201d Phan said. \u201cThey prefer porcelain flawless skin to the kind of bronze beauty preferred in the West \u2013 the philosophy is that if you\u2019ve got good skin you don\u2019t need a lot of make-up.\u201cBrands in each region reflect these priorities. In Japan, they prefer a more eccentric look; doll-like faces, color contacts and fake eyelashes. In South Korea, a more natural look is preferred while in Thailand, full straight brows are preferred with a pop of lip color.\u201d Star power One Korean brand in particular, Laneige (meaning the \u201cthe snow\u201d in French) and made by South Korea\u2019s AmorePacific Corp, is popular among China\u2019s middle classes. With its blue and white design and French cachet, the skincare product benefits from the soft power of being South Korean and, more importantly, cheaper. Vivienne Rudd, director of global innovation at market researcher Mintel, said South Korean beauty and personal care retail market posted 5.8% growth year-on-year to 2013 compared with just 2.1% for the UK and 3.9% for the US. \u201cThe success of South Korean brands has a lot to do with Chinese consumers copying the style of South Korean soap opera and music stars,\u201d Rudd told CNN. \u201cThey\u2019ll even go so far as to get the particular products being used by these stars. The stores will try to get in the exact shades that South Korean actresses are using.\u201d She said the same way that H&M and Zara will get catwalk styles in quickly, South Korean retailers will do the same with cosmetics. \u201cThis is particularly true with lip color,\u201d Rudd said. Hot market Increasingly, however, South Korea is setting the standard for the growing market in skincare products, creating the all-in-one BB creams \u2013 which contain tints, moisturizer and even sunblock \u2013 that have become so popular in Asia. \u201cSouth Korea is really the hot market for innovation and it\u2019s even overtaken markets like Japan as the place where everyone looks for the experts in skincare. The Chinese are fascinated by facial skincare and by face color cosmetics,\u201d Rudd said. \u201cSouth Korean women are very much held up as the standard of beauty across Asia.\u201d Despite the coverage that South Korean brands have received recently, it is still brands from Europe and the U.S. that rule the roost in China. Beauty expertise \u201cWestern brands such as L\u2019Oreal still have the brand recognition in China,\u201d Rudd said, adding that because South Korean brands have been slowing recently, they have been marketing more aggressively in the Chinese market with products aimed directly at Chinese consumers. Apart from creating brands that build on the idea that South Korea has a special expertise in terms of Asia beauty, South Korean cosmetics are seen as lighter and more fun than their Western counterparts. \u201cThey are very quick to use catchy new ingredients, thick textures and they\u2019re very careful with their pricing,\u201d she said. In the meantime, however, Chinese brands have not been slow to sell in their own markets with brands such as Shanghai Jahwa emerging as a major competitor to Western brands, especially third and fourth-tier cities in China. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain cachet with French brands, however, and it\u2019s amusing to see Chinese brands creating names in Chinese that, when pronounced phonetically, sound very much like French names,\u201d Rudd said.
