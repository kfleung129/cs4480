    "text": "As one of the most iconic fashion supermodels to ever grace the catwalk, Naomi Campbell is a force on and off the runway. Still, even with a career spanning decades the supermodel has yet to grace a beauty campaign\u2014until now. For the first time ever in her career, Naomi Campbell has officially been crowned the new face of NARS Cosmetics. Naomi and NARS announced the news by debuting a gorgeous close-up shot of the model, shot by NARS founder and French photographer, Francois Nars. \"Naomi is a living icon and brings such strong personality to the camera,\u201d Nars said of the new face of the brand's upcoming spring 2019 campaigns. \u201cShe and I are like family. I have known her since the very beginning of her career. From the start, I have admired her, her beauty, and her style.\u201d For Naomi, fronting NARS new campaign is a testament to her long-standing friendship with the founder. \"When I first started it was hard to find colors that truly matched my skin tone,\u201d she said to Us Weekly. \u201cI remember [Fran\u00e7ois] made me my own foundation.\u201d In a 2017 interview, Naomi revealed that regardless of her status in the industry, she still experienced colorism, which she believes is the reason she was never asked to front a beauty campaign. \"I\u2019ve never done one for anyone. People say, \u2018Oh, you\u2019ve got beautiful skin\u2019, and yet I\u2019ve never done one,\" she told the reporter. According to Us Weekly, Naomi's new partnership with NARS will be focused on the brand's foundation shade extensions, Skin Deep Eye Palette, and Super Radiant Booster.
