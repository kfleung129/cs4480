We have already formed some great partnerships with retailers including Lagard\u00e8re Travel Retail, Gebr. Heinemann and The Shilla Duty Free. We are looking to add to this growing list as well as developing new relationships. Given our strong portfolio of products, we see huge opportunity in travel retail, specifically through online, airports, airlines, cruises and ferries.

As a brand, we\u2019ve always been very agile and have always put the customer first. Our manufacturing, research and development, as well as our route to market capabilities have always been very well-defined. We launch trend initiatives faster than our competitors, which gives us a considerable market advantage. As such, we have the luxury of focusing all our attention on giving our customers what they want. What are your major targets by geography, channel or retailer type as you seek to tap into a recovering market? Travel retail is an emerging market for us with huge growth potential across all of its various channels. Our products are perfect for travel retail because they are accessible, fun, stylish, offer great quality and are easy to carry. TONYMOLY is extremely well-established in Asia; and we are also thriving in the US market. We recently launched in Europe and have had some high profile domestic listings including, Harrods. We started off very well in Europe and together with our partners we will continue to look for new growth opportunities. TR Partners has been appointed by South Korean beauty brand TONYMOLY to help develop its global footprint in both travel retail and selected local markets TONYMOLY is present in over 50 countries around the world and has approximately 600 stores in its home market of South Korea How do you view the continuing impact of COVID-19 on the wider industry? COVID-19 has given us all the time to pause for thought and to explore howe can do things differently. Given the current restrictions on movement caused by the pandemic crisis, customers have become extremely knowledgeable about what they are buying. This is because they are now spending a lot of time researching products online and through social media channels. COVID-19 era customers have already made purchase decisions before they even enter a store or visit its ecommerce platform. We believe that this can only benefit the industry, because brands will be more focused on creating products that customers really want.  How do you think the channel can and should engage with travelling consumers to ensure a sustained recovery? Customer engagement is becoming extremely important in such a competitive and contactless environment. Travel retail needs to engage with customers prior to their journey, whether that be through online, digital or social media. By doing so retailers and brands can give customers more reasons to shop, particularly during these uncertain times. Customers will return to stores once they can be assured that the retail environment is safe. How would you like to see industry partnerships evolve as we enter a new era for travel and travel retail? Partnership is the key word, landlords, retailers and brands need to work together to ensure that there is indeed a new era in travel retail. Working in isolation benefits no one, sharing data and getting closer to the customer is key for innovation and in boost sustained growth. It is very important to look towards the future in these challenging times, set a better way of working and to collaborate essentially.
