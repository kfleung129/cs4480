    "text": "German winters are long, so this metal-master was in search of a project to keep him busy during December evenings. \u201cAfter 25 years as a motorcycle rider, I had the feeling that I was missing something,\u201d explains Robrock. \u201cLife is just too short for stuff straight off the rack.\u201d Rather than choosing a classic from the 60s or 70s as a base, Robrock instead opted for the ugliest bike he could find. The fortunate nominee was a BMW K100 from 1984.  Robrock began to remove all unwanted parts, and set about cleaning the rest while taking care not to destroy three decades-worth of patina. He then added an aluminium sub-frame to support the hand-made seat; meanwhile, the wheels, forks and other components were sand-blasted and painted black. After five weeks of grinding, cutting and welding, he submitted his machine to the famously strict T\u00dcV (the German safety certification authority), and six weeks later it was returned with a clean bill of health. The resulting creation \u2013 named \u2018K-F\u00e9\u2019 \u2013 proudly displays its hand-formed metal in a raw, unpainted state. Next on the agenda for Robrock is a new exhaust, along with a prayer for the German winter to continue for as long as possible. Classic motorcycles can be found for sale in the\u00a0Classic Driver Market. ",
