Gone are the days of multi-stop trips to Target and Ulta Beauty for beauty finds. Thanks to a new partnership between the two retailers, you'll be able to snag all of your favorite Ulta Beauty products while checking off your to-do list inside Target. Ulta Beauty at Target is a new immersive experience designed as a shop-in-shop. Located next to Target's own beauty section, the new partnership was birthed out of a desire to introduce Target customers to brands not available at the popular one-stop-shop. Where Target has always housed brands like Sonia Kashuk and No7, Ulta Beauty has a more expansive assortment of brands that can enhance the beauty experience at Target, including Uoma Beauty, Colourpop, Lancome and more. \"We couldn\u2019t be happier about bringing these two trusted brands together to redefine retail beauty experiences,\" Brian Cornell, Target\u2019s chairman and CEO, says in a press release. \"This matchup brings Ulta Beauty\u2019s coveted prestige beauty assortment, category expertise and guest loyalty together with Target\u2019s high-growth beauty business and the ease and convenience of our industry-leading fulfillment services.\" Target also has plans to train its staff to perform the same consultative services customers receive in a regular Ulta Beauty store. Plus, Target\u2019s contactless same-day fulfillment services\u2014Drive Up, Order Pickup and Shipt\u2014will be available for Ulta Beauty at Target purchases at participating locations. But don't run to Target or jump on the website just yet\u2014the first Ulta Beauty at Target locations will launch in 2021.
