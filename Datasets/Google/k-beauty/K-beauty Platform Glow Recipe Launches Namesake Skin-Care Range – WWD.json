    "text": "The multitasking skin-care duo launches at Sephora today. Beauty Editor, Prestige NEW YORK \u2014 South Korean beauty incubator and e-commerce site Glow Recipe is introducing a namesake line of product. Until now, the business has been split between discovering South Korean beauty lines and then adapting them for the U.S. market and maintaining e-commerce site Glowrecipe.com to sell these products. But now, Sarah Lee and Christine Chang, cofounders and co-chief executive officers of Glow Recipe, are parlaying their expertise in K-beauty into a new multitasking skin-care range, that to start, has two products. A Watermelon Glow Sleeping Mask, $45, gel hydrator and exfoliator, and a Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser, $34, a deep cleanser, will be launched today\u00a0at Glowrecipe.com, sephora.com and will enter all Sephora stores in the U.S. June 2. (A prelaunch last week on Glowrecipe.com sold out in five hours, and there\u2019s now a 5,000 person waitlist for the mask.) Both products do\u00a0double duty or even triple duty in the case of the cleanser, which according to Chang cleanses, moisturizes and even takes on the role of a toner.

The sleeping mask, for instance, exfoliates and hydrates simultaneously \u2014 and effectively without irritation. It\u2019s also made with watermelon, a \u201ctime tested DIY ingredient\u201d in South Korea that\u2019s used for things from heat rash to hydrating face mists. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing great technology there [in South Korea] that we wanted to, essentially, distill it for the U.S. customer. While K-beauty has been amazing, there is still a lot of education that needs to happen. People are still very overwhelmed and still ask, \u2018Is it really 15 steps?\u2019\u201d Chang said, calling her and Lee\u2019s collection \u201cthe best in South Korean technology an innovation\u201d but delivered in a \u201ccompact and thoughtful way.\u201d And with Glow Recipe\u2019s personal spin. Chang maintained that product development took 18 months and testing more than\u00a01,000 formula submissions. Along with Lee, the two poured over technology, textures and ingredients and vetted product with a multiethnic testing panel over the course of many rounds. Since inception, the company\u2019s business has been split between retail platform and incubator, but the addition of Glow Recipe\u2019s own brand creates a third revenue stream. It won\u2019t cannibalize the existing e-commerce business, which carries around 30 South Korea-based brands, Chang said. \u201cWhen we product develop we don\u2019t ever look at what\u2019s doing well among the brands we partner with and create a lower cost version of them. That\u2019s not how we approached this,\u201d Chang said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be at forefront of trend and ingredient stories, and having a private brand gives us the flexibility and the quickness that will allow [us to] be at the forefront these trends.\u201d Since founding Glow Recipe almost three years ago, Chang and Lee have not raised any outside capital and maintain the operation has been cash flow positive since the beginning. The $3,000 the two generated in revenue during their first two months in business quickly grew to $1 million a year later, Lee said, adding that company saw triple digit growth in 2016 and is on track to do the same the year. In March, they opened their first U.S. pop-up in SoHo, and in early May, a second temporary space bowed in Saks Fifth Avenue\u2019s The Wellery.  \u201cOur Instagram following grew by 2,000 people in one day,\u201d Lee said of announcing a prelaunch of Glow Recipe\u2019s new products last week. \u201cThe interest is there, and it will help to put out the Glow Recipe name\u2026.As a whole it\u2019s a good thing for everyone on the platform.\u201d Sign up for beauty news straight to your inbox every day Top News Stories Alerts Straight to your Inbox.
