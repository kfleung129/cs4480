    "text": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Korean beauty products have been much buzzed-about in recent months, but there\u2019s substance behind the hype. Korean women are among the world\u2019s most sophisticated and demanding skin-care customers, constantly adjusting their treatment regimens in a quest for radiant, poreless complexions. \u201cFrom the day they\u2019re born, Korean women are told that taking care of your skin is one of the most important things,\u201d says Sarah Lee, co-founder and co-chief executive officer at glowrecipe.com, an online K-beauty boutique. \u201cKorean women will do almost anything to make sure their skin looks flawless.\u201d The multi-step Korean skin-care routine was born out of that devotion. The program usually starts with a two-part cleansing process: an oil to remove makeup, then a foaming or gel formula. This is followed by toner, gentle exfoliation and essences (similar to serums but usually lighter), depending on the need. Serums, eye cream, lightweight moisturizer and cream moisturizer typically round out the ritual. Sunscreen is nonnegotiable during the day, spritzes of soothing mist are common, and most women use masks too. Alicia Yoon, co-founder and chief executive officer of online Asian beauty retailer peachandlily.com, says Korean beauty companies churn out advanced products at lightning speed to meet the desires of their discerning customers. \u201cIn America, a lot of our consumers ask general questions, like \u2018How do I prevent aging?\u2019 \u201d she says. \u201cBut in Korea, people are very targeted about what their issues are and what the solutions could be.\u201d Yoon believes that Korean skin care is a decade or more ahead of the West because companies innovate constantly to keep up with the competition and can turn on a dime. Take BB creams, the foundation-plus-treatment-with-SPF hybrids. When BBs hit the States in 2011, they were already six years old in Korea. Recently, Western companies have entered the fray with their versions of K-beauty essentials. After a wave of alphabet products (like BB creams), the tide is turning to cushion compacts, which\u00a0house a sponge soaked in lightweight treatment foundation. Lanc\u00f4me unveiled its $47 Miracle Cushion Liquid Cushion Compact last month. Essences are another area of activity: Tata Harper has Hydrating Floral Essence ($65) and Clinique debuted Even Better Essence Lotion ($32) last year. Today, K-beauty\u2019s hottest categories include cushion cheek and lip color and sheet masks, which are individually packaged cotton or fiber cloths that deliver active ingredients to the skin. Others are made of gel-like bio-cellulose that conforms to the face. But at the rate Korean skin care advances, those will soon be replaced by new breakthroughs. 136-80 Roosevelt Ave., 718-888-9097 Michael SofronskiA lush faux-plant wall says \u201cHey, we\u2019re natural\u201d \u2014 and products touting everything from Hawaiian hibiscus to Gangwon deep seawater seem to back that up. The Aloe Vera 92% Soothing Gel for the face ($6.50) has a big following. The clean, well-organized store also has the obligatory mollusk items, said to have regenerative properties and replenish the skin\u2019s moisture: try Snail Solution 70 Cream ($59.90). 136-20 Roosevelt Ave., 718-353-8808 Flushing\u2019s answer to a beauty-supply store, this emporium is jam-packed with products. There\u2019s the obligatory wall of sheet masks, priced for risk-free experimentation at $1 to $6 a pop, a huge selection of BB creams, an array of eyeliners and much more. 136-89 Roosevelt Ave., 718-353-0031 Zandy MangoldTake the name literally: The products are formulated with food ingredients. The $15 Black Sugar Mask Wash Off, for instance, is a runaway best seller. Salespeople are friendly at this grocery-themed shop, and are quick to pass out dollar-off coupons for the already super-affordable in-store nail bar. A manicure at the wooden table will set you back just $8. 136-86 Roosevelt Ave., 516-714-3953 Zandy MangoldMakeup in every iteration \u2014 from edgy to girly to natural \u2014 is this store\u2019s specialty. It stocks four house brands: Clio Professional (which includes the ominous-sounding but popular Kill Cover foundations), Peripera makeup, Goodal (natural ingredient skincare) and Soo Ae (masks). The store recently started carrying a collection of sheet masks to satisfy increasing demand. 136-62 39th Ave., 718-939-2089 Just around the corner from the main Roosevelt Avenue drag, the Yeon carries natural products in festive packaging. Lotus, tangerine, honey and the ubiquitous snail extract are key ingredients in its skincare collections. Customer fave: the Jeju Hallabong Live Pack, $25.60, a moisturizing gel housed in a lifelike \u201ctangerine\u201d jar. 136-20 Roosevelt Ave., 917-913-2581 Zandy MangoldThere\u2019s a TonyMoly in Manhattan\u2019s Koreatown (316 Fifth Ave.), but this one has a bigger selection of their skin care, hair care, body and makeup in irresistibly cute packaging. The brand\u2019s snail-mucin line is a top seller for serious skin care, but novelty items catch the eye. How about Egg Pore Blackhead Out Oil Gel in a plastic egg? Or Panda Dream So Cool Eye Stick in \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 a panda tube? 136-53 Roosevelt Ave., 718-888-0546 Zandy MangoldThis Korean giant focused on skin care, body and color cosmetics \u2014 and sheet masks galore\u2014 moved last year to a bigger space. Look for the Character Mask collection, hyaluronic acidcollagen\u00a0treatments that come in kooky panda, tiger, sheep and dragon designs for $4 each. There\u2019s also a branch near Herald Square at 42 W. 32nd St. ",
