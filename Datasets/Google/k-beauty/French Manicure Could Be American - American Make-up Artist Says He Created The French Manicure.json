    "title": "French Manicure Could Be American - American Make-up Artist Says He Created The French Manicure",
    "text": "Everything we thought we knew about nails is a lie. Brace yourselves: The French manicure may not be so French after-all. Or at least, that's what one Hollywood make-up artist named Jeff Pink is claiming. According to WWD, the American stylist is asserting he's the one who came up with the white tip-nude base combo in the seventies. Pink then says he single-handedly brought the mani to Paree, where the tres chic models walking the catwalks quickly flipped for it. He even trademarked the term The Original French manicure after creating his own nail polish lined called Orly International in 1975. But there are other nail-polish-know-it-alls who argue that the French was actually around about 40 years before Pink claimed to have come up with it. For instance, the BBC suggests that the early French manicure was, in fact, invented in France by beauty legend Max Factor, for the fashionable ladies of Paris in the 1930s. Apparently, they wanted a clean look because their hands were over-moisturized (or something?). Ironically enough, women who are preferential to the sophisticated-sounding mani these days are no longer French fashionistas; instead, it's more common to find French manis on the hard acrylics of little ladies heading to the prom.
