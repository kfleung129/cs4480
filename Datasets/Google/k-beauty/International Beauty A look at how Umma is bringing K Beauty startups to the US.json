Building a global business\u200b Umma got its start in 2014 as b2link, a sort of tech-forward distribution platform that helped K Beauty brands find a home in the Chinese marketplace, Jung tells Cosmetics Design. Since then, with the Western interest in K beauty rising, the company has become a venture that identifies compelling and/or innovative emerging Korean skin care and beauty startups, partners with those brands, and accelerates their international expansion. The brands that Umma works with are \u201cundiscovered\u201d \u200band often have \u201cno resources to globalize,\u201d \u200bexplains Jung. Nurturing a local brand\u200b As Jung explains it, Umma (pronounced ah\u00b7mah) is a word used for mother in Korean. And the company specializes in nurturing undiscovered brands. \u201cWe want to be their mom,\u201d \u200bshe tells Cosmetics Design. The company is working with more than 150 brand now, according to Jung, but will be bringing only 10 to the US for\u00a0Umma's formal debut in the States. The company did a soft launch just over one year ago, according to Jung, but will arrive here in earnest before the end of the year. Jung tells Cosmetics Design that the pace of beauty innovation in South Korea is swift. There are, she says, more than 5,000 beauty brands in the country and a new K Beauty brand can come to life in as few as 3 months. Developing regional partnerships\u200b At Cosmoprof North America, Umma had a stylish booth tucked in the corner of the Discover Beauty section\u2014a place where new and unique beauty brands were exhibiting their product portfolios and engaging with buyers, press, and other attendees seeking out trends and innovation. Jung used the event as an opportunity to connect with buyers and channel partners\u2014department store buyers, big box retailers, etc. Her colleagues at Umma headquarters in Korea have got new brand discovery covered, she explains, saying that their job is to \u201ccatch the latest trends and newest brands.\u201d\u200b Sometimes Umma takes exclusive distribution of a brand (an on occasion invests in K Beauty startups), when it seems like a particularly good fit for the US market, Jung tells this publication. But the company\u2019s main revenue comes from channel partners; and that\u2019s what incentivizes her work. \u201cWe want our channel parteners to have a great experience working with us,\u201d\u200b Jung says, adding that any \u201csales person can get the first sale, but that a second and third order comes from consumers.\u201d\u200b Which is where Umma\u2019s brand nurturing comes in. The company helps K Beauty startups with market-ready branding, regulatory issues, and marketing;\u201cespecially social media marketing like YouTube and Instagram, and [establishing] partnerships with influencers,\u201d \u200b\u200bJung tells Cosmetics Design. \u200bAccordingly, in the run up to Umma\u2019s official debut in the States later this year, the company is hiring business development managers and PR talent with regional expertise. --- Deanna Utroske, CosmeticsDesign.com Editor, covers beauty business news in the Americas region and publishes the weekly Indie Beauty Profile column, showcasing the inspiring work of entrepreneurs and innovative brands.
