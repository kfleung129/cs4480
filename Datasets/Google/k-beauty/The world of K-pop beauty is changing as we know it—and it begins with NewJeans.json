Just earlier this year in July, the rookie K-pop group under Hybe\u2019s sub-label Ador, made their high-impact debut with \u2018Attention\u2019 and \u2018Hype Boy\u2019, the leading singles of the group\u2019s first EP that propelled them to the top of multiple global music charts. Breaking records as the fastest idol group to have their debut song hit over 100,000 plays on Spotify, the South Korean quintet comprising Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin and Hyein have also been the talk of town lately for their strides in the fashion scene\u2014with Hanni recently announced as Gucci\u2019s global ambassador. But lean a little closer and you might notice how they\u2019re heralding a shift elsewhere in the K-pop world: its longstanding beauty standards. For over a decade, South Korean idol groups have been known to perpetuate certain beauty ideals, some affecting self-image more than others. Considering how many of these idols were often costumed and made-up to reflect the idealised aesthetic of their time, it\u2019s no surprise that many of these embodied visual concepts were the catalysts of new beauty trends for the younger set to emulate. One only needs to take a walk back down memory lane to witness how veteran girl groups such as Girls\u2019 Generation and Wonder Girls had set the standard. Softly curled tousles and smoked out liners often spotted in their early music videos soon transformed into rainbow-inspired manes and bright, flirty pouts. This preceded more ethereal affairs of gravity-defying nails and bejewelled lids\u2014spotted on the helming idol groups of K-pop\u2019s later generations such as Red Velvet, Twice, ITZY and Aespa. These ever-evolving beauty looks worn on idols in recent years have become moodboards of inspiration for MUAs and Korean beauty enthusiasts all the same; each one with its own aspirational aesthetic to work towards. But enter: NewJeans. Right from the first hit of the play button for \u2018Attention\u2019, we\u2019re already convinced that what they\u2019re meant to bring to the table isn\u2019t just a fresh sound, but a new aesthetic that goes against the grain of predisposed beauty standards in K-pop. Flipping around their straight, black hair as they groove to the beat, running free on the streets with minimal base on their miens teamed with nude, muted hues on their lips, the NewJeans girls are going au naturel and they\u2019re owning it. \ufeff Instead of heavy faces of make-up\u2014complete with impeccably styled manes and exquisite manicures\u2014the music video for \u2018Attention\u2019 portrays the girls in a sprightly, youthful light imbued via barely-there looks, almost like the perfect embodiment of a girl their age (their oldest member Minji, is only 18). Whilst their nails are left naked or nude, their faces see a tone-on-tone approach: where their blush shades match the soft hue on their lips, creating a slightly pinked look that\u2019s still playful and fresh. Stray strands of hair fall across their faces as they joyfully dance away, echoing the sporty dynamic channelled through their Y2K-inspired style; an aesthetic that carries through the music video for \u2018Hype Boy\u2019 as well. Not only is it a stark shift away from the usually high-octane aesthetic of idol groups, it\u2019s also one that doesn\u2019t seem to be limited to just this season of their career. Whilst it\u2019s definitely in line with the post-pandemic trends of beauty\u2014think TikTok\u2019s reigning clean girl aesthetic\u2014their embodying of a fun, fresh look establishes a new standard of beauty in K-pop that can actually be practically achieved by other girls of their age. It dials down on the dazzle overall but plays into the sentiment of each individual\u2019s blooming strengths instead of trying to fit them all squarely into the same box. So be it a light base, a rosy blush or glossy, tinted pouts, these girls are representative of an alternative beauty aesthetic we can only hope to see more of in K-pop from here on out: fresh-faced, natural and ultimately carefree.
