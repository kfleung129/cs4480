    "text": " Charlotte Cho, Cofounder and Chief Curator of Soko Glam and founder of Then I Met You, Photo Credit:... [+] Meredith Jenks, Red Antler  To beauty insiders, Charlotte Cho is an icon. And now thanks to the launch of her own\u00a0skincare brand, Then I Met You, Cho's business\u00a0savvy is also getting its much-deserved time in the spotlight. Named among WWD\u2019s \"40 Under 40\" in 2017, Cho pivoted from\u00a0public relations to beauty, when along with her husband she launched the e-commerce site Soko Glam, dedicated to all things Korean beauty. A firm\u00a0believer in the power of rich content, Cho\u00a0launched The Klog (an editorial sister site to Soko Glam), and published her debut book,\u00a0The Little Book of Skin Care: Korean Beauty Secrets for Healthy, Glowing Skin. The next natural step for Cho? Creating her own line\u00a0of skincare, which she launched in mid-October of this year. Named\u00a0Then I Met You, the premium skincare brand consists of a two-step cleansing process, which includes the\u00a0Living Cleansing Balm and Soothing Tea Cleansing Gel. As opposed to\u00a0using terms like \"quick and easy\u201d as a selling point, Then I Met You\u2019s ethos is all about the importance of taking\u00a0one's\u00a0time, enjoying every minute of\u00a0one's\u00a0skincare\u00a0ritual, and \u201cglowing deeper.\u201d The double cleanse process is inspired by the Korean concept of jeong, which Cho defines as \"deep, emotional connections with people, places and things.\" (Cho's second book will dive deeper into the concept of jeong and is set for a 2019 release.) When it come to Then I Met You, the devil \u2014\u00a0or better yet, the beauty\u00a0\u2014 is in the details.\u00a0Cho was deliberate and intentional about every decision when it came to the development and production of Then I Met You, from the bright yellow shade of the cleansing balm and periwinkle blue tone of the packaging, to the scent and ingredients of the products. I spoke with Cho about her evolution from e-commerce and curation to skincare brand creator, why she's pushing #SelflessSundays as a movement instead of #SelfCareSundays, and why she's all about \"glowing deeper\" in everything you do. Karin Eldor: Congrats on the launch of Then I Met You! What inspired the idea to develop your own brand of skincare? Charlotte Cho:\u00a0Thank you so much! In 2013, when Soko Glam was only a year old, everyone was asking me when I would develop my own products. I could have easily white labeled products and called it \"Soko Glam,\" but I wanted to take my time to do it right. In all, it took about a decade of testing, discovering new skincare innovations, getting my aesthetician license, and speaking to the Soko Glam community to understand how and what I would create. I created Then I Met You because I reached a turning point in my life where I wanted to challenge myself to create beautiful formulations, with premium ingredients that would enhance my skincare routine. Another goal I had was ensuring that this luxurious experience would be available to the community,\u00a0at an\u00a0accessible price point. Eldor: I love that you are intentional about everything you\u2019ve done with Then I Met You and focused on creating less items but making them unique. Why was this important to you? Cho:\u00a0Intentionality is a major part of my philosophy with Then I Met You, because  I believe you can create something meaningful and substantial if you take the time to go deeper. One example of this is when I was making the Living Cleansing Balm: the cosmetic scientist I worked closely with cautioned me to use less of the sea buckthorn oils in the balm, because at the current formulation, the product would have to retail at around $150. But I persisted and made sure I created a cleansing balm that was to my highest standard, and gave me the experience and results I wanted. He didn\u2019t know that we always intended to go direct to our consumers and cut out the middlemen (retailers), and that I would be able to price it so that my community could get access to premium quality without an exorbitant luxury price tag.

Cho:\u00a0We are living in an age of superficiality and distractions, and I truly believe we need to work towards creating deeper connections with one another.\u00a0We infused\u00a0jeong\u00a0into Then I Met You, starting with our decision to sell direct-to-consumer so that we could focus on having an intimate relationship with our customers, all the way down to the pre-stamped postcards we include in every order as an encouragement to write a meaningful message to someone that matters in their life. On social, we have #SelflessSundays (instead of #SelfCareSundays), where we encourage people to post about what they\u2019ve done to cultivate deeper relationships that day. Eldor: You\u2019ve built a highly engaged community with Soko Glam. Tell us what you were doing before you launched Soko Glam, and what led to its launch? Cho:\u00a0After moving to Seoul, Korea to work at Samsung, I discovered the world of Korean beauty and skincare. After using the products and applying the Korean \u201cskin-first\u201d philosophy, I saw my skin as well as my confidence transform, so it became my passion to share the products and techniques in the U.S., where I knew these were not easily accessible. My husband Dave Cho and I decided to start Soko Glam in 2012, despite the fact that there were many factors going against us. For starters, we had zero experience in e-commerce and beauty! Many doubted that we could get people in the U.S. to care about unfamiliar Korean beauty brands online, especially if they couldn\u2019t touch and feel the products in person. We never started Soko Glam because it was a guaranteed business model; it was a passion project fueled by an interest in helping all people become more knowledgeable about skincare and finding the right products for their skin concerns (note: Soko Glam is credited with introducing the\u00a0\u201c10-Step Korean Skincare Routine\u201d to North America). This genuine approach allowed me to build a community of skincare enthusiasts that were excited to discover and explore my curations. Now in 2018, Soko Glam has millions in unique monthly visitors, and we\u2019ve been profitable since year two, growing an average of two to three times per year.  Eldor: What are your 3 biggest tips for female entrepreneurs looking to start their own company? Cho: 1- Start a company if you have a genuine desire or passion for the industry and the problem you are solving. If you\u2019re doing it for the money or fame, you won\u2019t get very far. 2- It took a decade of exploring Korean beauty trends, getting my aesthetician license, and speaking to my community to be able to grow Soko Glam to where it is today, and then launch Then I Met You on my terms.  Being an overnight success is a myth that you shouldn\u2019t chase. \u00a0Know that anything that is worthwhile will always take time and hard work. 3- If you\u2019re on the fence about launching your own business because you\u2019re afraid of failing, I always say just go for it. If it doesn\u2019t work out, you\u2019re still smart and capable. There will always be another job waiting for you. Eldor: In today\u2019s digital fast-paced era, I love the reminder to slow down, write a note to someone you love and \u201cglow deeper.\u201d Why did you tie this into Then I Met You? Cho:\u00a0When you\u2019re going through the motions of life at 100 miles per hour, it\u2019s easy to lose sight of what\u2019s meaningful. At 33, I am experiencing a turning point in my adult life as well, with the desire for meaningful connections, tangible experiences and a focus on substance. The name, Then I Met You, signifies a turning point in your life, which hopefully inspires you to pause, take a breath and cut out the noise, and go deeper in not only how you take care of your skin, but also the way you live.
