    "text": "The weekly round-up of the Billboard Korea K-Pop Hot 100 chart with extra K-pop news bits. By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJeff Benjamin In line with finale of a major U.S. singing competition this week, Roy Kim (the winner of a similar show in South Korea, \u201cSuperstar K\u201d) spends his third week atop the K-Pop Hot 100 chart. The country-inspired single\u2019s music video broke two million views this week. Singing competition champions do not usually find huge YouTube numbers so quickly, but Roy Kim seems to be in a league with other reality stars who opted out of a major agency signing like Busker Busker (whose \u201cCherry Blossom Ending\u201d has 4 million views).

But it looks like 4minute\u2019s \u201cWhat\u2019s Your Name?\u201d can be officially named the champion of May girl groups as the song rises to a new peak this week (No. 2) as the others fall\u2014Secret\u2019s \u201cYooHoo\u201d is down two spots to No. 6, T-ara N4\u2019s \u201cCountryside Life\u201d is down five to No. 15 and Hello Venus\u2019 \u201cWould You Like Tea?\u201d falls 12 to No. 48.  The track is a return to the original form for 4minute going back to their mashed electronic hip-hop sounds and the public is still loving it as other girls fall. As reported last week, member HyunA had fallen ill and needed to be hospitalized, but is back in action. Just in time too as 4minute snatched yet another No. 1 spot for a music program, this week on Mnet\u2019s M! Countdown. \u00a0Check out a quick clip of them celebrating and performing below.  Lee Hyori continues a major comeback without any promotions (yet) as her pre-release single \u201cMiss Korea\u201d soars eight spots to No. 3. She\u2019s already finding a warm return before promoting paving the way for a successful album after three years absent from the K-pop scene. Find the video and more Lee Hyori news here. In other interesting chart moves, some rising K-pop groups made major moves this week. K-Town reported on boy band B1A4\u2019s \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On?\u201d and how it had the potential to give the boys their biggest hit yet. The theory proved true as the One Direction-esque track rockets 18 spots to No. 13 giving them their highest chart position to date. Watch a super-fun performance from Mnet\u2019s M Countdown this weekend:   The mature nine-member female group Nine Muses also made a big splash on the K-Pop Hot 100 with new single \u201cWild.\u201d The girls had struggled to land a hit before with a retro-inspired sound, but it seems they finally found hit their stride with this EDM-inspired track. The steamy music video with quite-suggestive imagery probably didn\u2019t hurt anything either. Take a gander at the video for the No. 18\u2013their highest charting single\u2013below:  Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.
