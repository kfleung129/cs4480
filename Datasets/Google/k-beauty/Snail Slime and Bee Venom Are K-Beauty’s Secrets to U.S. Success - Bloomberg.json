In 2012, Alicia Yoon quit her job and hopped on a plane from New York to Seoul to scour South Korea for its most advanced skin-care products. She\u2019d started to hear some buzz about lotions and potions coming from research labs in the country, soothing creams and pore-minimizing serums with ingredients, such as snail slime, not used by any mainstream brand. Yoon\u2019s goal was to persuade the makers of some of the products to allow her to sell their wares in the U.S. It would take only a few weeks, she figured, so that summer she crashed at her parents\u2019 house\u2014Yoon was born and raised in South Korea\u2014and spent her days knocking on laboratory door after laboratory door. \u201cIt was like a disaster, I had no income,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought, If in six months I\u2019m not able to secure my first brand, the timing is probably not right.\u201d It ended up taking 5\u00bd months for Yoon to get a single label, called Be the Skin, to sign on with her new business, Peach & Lily. Korean companies were initially wary of expanding beyond their own borders, especially with unknown sellers. So entrepreneurs like Yoon had to focus on cultivating relationships with owners.
