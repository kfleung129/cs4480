    "text": "Agenda-setting intelligence, analysis and advice for the global fashion community. South Korean makeup and skincare brand Innisfree\u2019s sustainability credentials are under fire after a customer found that eco-friendly packaging it marketed as a \u201cpaper bottle\u201d was actually a plastic bottle concealed in paper wrapping, The Korea Herald reports. The discovery was made by a customer who posted images of the bottle in a Facebook group dedicated to plastic-free shopping. In a statement published by The Korea Herald, Innisfree said it \u201coverlooked the possibility that the naming could mislead people to think the whole packaging is made of paper\u201d and apologised for the confusion caused. The brand added that the plastic bottle, which is recyclable and came with recycling instructions, uses less plastic than typical beauty packaging, but that statement failed to quell concerns over alleged greenwashing. The anonymous netizen who made the post deemed the apology \u201cinsufficient\u201d. \u00a9 2023 The Business of Fashion. All rights reserved.
