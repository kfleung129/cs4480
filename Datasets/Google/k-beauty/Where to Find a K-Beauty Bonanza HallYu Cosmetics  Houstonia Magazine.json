Image: Emily Juhasz I always feel like a little girl in a candy store whenever I enter a shop that sells makeup. Maybe\u00a0it\u2019s the endless dazzling palettes or the salesperson telling me how amazing\u00a0I look with the products smeared on my face, or the fact that I can swatch 10 million colors onto my hand and not be looked at like a crazy person\u2014at least I\u2019ve been assured that\u2019s normal. No matter the scenario, I always leave feeling like a million bucks. But walking in\u00a0HallYu Cosmetics is a beauty experience like no other. HallYu is a Houston-based shop dedicated to Korean skincare and cosmetics,\u00a0also known as K-beauty. Located on the thriving\u00a0Asian district along\u00a0Bellaire, its\u00a0a hidden gem with an emphasis on hidden. Owners recently\u00a0re-designed the store logo and are currently in between signs, which doesn't do much to help, but I can assure you it is\u00a0open and ready to make your K-beauty dreams a reality. I choose you, Pok\u00e9mon cleanser. Image: Emily Juhasz As soon as I walked through the doors, everything I thought I knew about\u00a0makeup\u00a0went out the window. Beauty destinations\u00a0like Sephora, Target and Ulta have increasingly been adding buzzy Korean lines to their shelves, but\u00a0HallYu Cosmetics is different. Not only had I entered a cosmetic paradise, it's a total immersion\u00a0in K-beauty culture. HallYu carries about\u00a020 different Korean brands.\u00a0Some, like Tony Moly, are the Asian version of drugstore staples like\u00a0Maybelline, while others are more specialty lines with price points similar to, say, Smashbox or other Sephora brands. While I explored the options, Hallyu's executive administrator Melody Vo caught up with me and explained that even though shops\u00a0like HallYu Cosmetics are capitalizing on a global craze\u2014overseas sales of Korean beauty products rose 73 percent in 2015\u2014they are still fairly under the radar in Houston. \u201cI think there are many people in Houston who don\u2019t realize that there are shops that sell specialty items like Lolita fashion or Korean cosmetics, but when they do find out they\u2019re just wondering why they didn\u2019t know about it sooner!\u201d she says. \u201cWe pride ourselves on the fact that we do carry a variety of products from brands that people can choose and learn more about.\u201d The store has a soothing atmosphere almost reminiscent of a spa\u2014clean yet inviting with bare walls and mirrors set above and\u00a0perfectly angled downward for shoppers to watch themselves\u00a0test out samples. I was surprised to learn that Korean skincare is actually quite different from my dry and drab routine.\u00a0The typical Korean skincare\u00a0routine famously\u00a0includes up to 10 steps in order to maintain an all-around healthy complexion. Yes, these are PowerPuff Girl cushion compacts, and, yes, I'm obsessed. Image: Emily Juhasz I didn\u2019t recognize many of the labels, but one line that made my heart flip was\u00a0TonyMoly, which to my delight\u00a0released a Pok\u00e9mon collection last year. The Pikachu eye shadow palette is literally everything. Another brand, PeriPera, had me some sort of way with its Power Puff Girls collection. And I thought the recent Clinique collaboration with Crayola was something special. Whether you\u2019re a makeup newbie or a makeup artist extraordinaire, HallYu Cosmetics provides an all-encompassing experience that brings K-beauty to our own backyard.
