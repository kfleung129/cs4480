    "text": "When Korean skin care went mainstream, it shook up our beauty routines significantly. The oft-lauded 12 steps championed by K-beauty aestheticians, brands, and influencers have made us all rethink self-care and wellness, with more focus on gentle, effective, and hydrating ingredients that can help your skin achieve that revered glow. Sun care is especially key to the regimen\u2014not only in your daily SPF (sun protection factor), but as a component of countless other high-performing skin-care products.\u201cFrom toddler age, Korean people (and women especially) are taught that caring for your skin is part of taking care of yourself,\u201d Peach & Lily founder and aesthetician Alicia Yoon tells Coveteur. \u201cThe aesthetics do matter, but it\u2019s more about making sure your organs are healthy\u2014we\u2019re being taught how to care for our skin at the same time we\u2019re being taught how to properly brush our teeth.\u201d She stresses that K-beauty devotees are taught to wear SPF from a young age and carry that sensibility into adulthood. That mindset stands in contrast with the US, where the conversation around safe sun practices is changing, albeit slowly. In fact, according to a 2013 CDC study, fewer than 15 percent of men and 30 percent of women regularly use sunscreen on their face and body when outside for more than an hour. Says Yoon, \u201cIn Korea, it\u2019s more of an \u2018of course I wear sunscreen\u2019 mentality. It\u2019s ingrained, and there\u2019s an awareness that sunscreen is such an important part of your health and taking care of yourself.\u201dSOKO Glam founder Charlotte Cho considers sunscreen the last and arguably most important step in K beauty\u2019s multi-step skin-care routine. \u201cSun damage is the leading cause of premature aging, such as fine lines and dark spots, and you can reap the benefits from being skin savvy at any age, especially when it comes to protecting yourself from skin cancer.\u201d One of SOKO Glam\u2019s best-selling sunscreens that has over 300 five-star reviews. Your new favorite SPF product that also hydrates, brightens skin, and firms. Boasts 20 botanical ingredients, an essence-like texture that glides on, and a broad-spectrum SPF 50+ PA++++ rating.

A cult-classic SPF, this formula blurs your skin just ever so slightly for a gorgeous filter-type effect. If you\u2019re experiencing any sort of irritation (especially with the constant mask wearing outside), the added aloe in this cream will help to calm and reset your skin. ",
