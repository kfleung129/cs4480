Since the chart\u2019s August 2011 creation, IU has spent a remarkable 10 weeks in the top position. She first hit No. 1 in December 2011 with \u201cYou and I\u201d which locked itself on top for five weeks, a record at the time. The Seoul native came close to tying the feat when \u201cEvery End of the Day\u201d reigned for four weeks in spring 2012. \u201cThe Red Shoes\u201d gives her a tenth week at No. 1, extending her lead over SISTAR, who have garnered eight weeks atop from four No. 1s. Watch IU perform the hit single live wearing, of course, red heels below:  Despite T-ara still being plagued by last summer\u2019s highly-controversial incident\u00a0(where they were criticized for allegedly bullying and forcing member Hwayoung out), the group, now boasting six members after Areum left to pursue a solo career, have made a strong comeback. New single \u201cNo.9\u201d snags the Hot Shot Debut on the K-Pop Hot 100 this week at No. 6. The girl group\u2019s latest EP \u201cAgain,\u201d released on Oct. 10, consists of five new tracks and enlists an extensive roster of Korea\u2019s hottest producers, including Shinsadong Tiger, Duble Sidekick, Choi Kyu Sung, Park Duk Sang and Park Hyun Joong.  The electro-pop single, \u201cNo.9,\u201d is an addictive, pumping techno-dance track with sad lyrics that aim to showcase the group\u2019s collective musical maturity. Its original music video, where the girls dance and sing in racy outfits, has racked up 1.8 million views since its Oct. 9 reveal (below). To capitalize on the interest, Core Contents Media released the second version on Oct. 16.  T-ara also released a second single to promote the \u201cAgain\u201d EP with \u201cBecause I Know.\u201d The simple track features the girls offering hushed singing and rapping over the acoustic-leaning mid-tempo production. It\u2019s an extreme opposite from the bumping \u201cNo.9\u201d and lacks the same energy. It debuts 12 spots behind the dance track at No. 21.  After bursting into the Top 10 last week, Seo In Young \u2014 the solo vocalist and former member of veteran K-pop girl group Jewelry \u2014 slips to No. 19 with \u201cLove Me,\u201d featuring Dynamic Duo\u2019s Gaeko. The K-diva\u2019s latest single is produced and composed by hitmaker extraordinaire KUSH (BIGBANG, 2NE1). In the post-disco-influenced track, Seo In Young asks for her ex-love to \u201clove her again\u201d with her signature, crystal-clear vocals. Dynamic Duo\u2019s Gaeko evens out the song with his rhythmic rapping. In the music video, Seo In Young (in her new platinum blonde hairdo) is seen wondering around the streets, playing with Legos and spray painting in various rock-chic ensembles. The video has amassed a cool 200,000 views since its release on Oct. 3.
