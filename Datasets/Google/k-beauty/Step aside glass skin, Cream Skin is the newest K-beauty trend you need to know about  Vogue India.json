Korean women and men focus on hydration\u2014layering on toners, moisturisers, oils and essences in an attempt to make their skin plumper, younger, brighter and glowier, with nary a pore or blackhead in sight. When you think of K-beauty, glass skin is one of the first terms to come to mind\u2014it was major beauty trend that was seen on the runways, on influencers and all over Instagram, which was then magnified by a whole skincare category created to precipitate the look.

The answer is cream skin. \"Laneige launched their Cream Skin product, which is a fusion between a hydrating toner and moisturiser, and it started the whole trend,\u201d says Charlotte Cho, co-founder of Soko Glam, which is credited as one of the first retailers to bring Korean beauty to the USA. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique product formulation that is milky in texture and not creamy or heavy as the name may imply\u2014it\u2019s quite lightweight and refreshing and absorbs quickly into the skin, which is one of the reasons for its popularity in Korea and now in the US,\u201d she explains.

If you\u2019re thinking that it sounds a lot like glass skin anyway, Cho points the difference. \u201cGlass skin was a trend that promised translucent and poreless skin, achieved after exfoliating and hydrating it the right way with the right products. In comparison, the cream skin category helps to cut down the number of steps in your skincare routine while softening and nourishing the skin, with a focus on deep hydration,\u201d she says. Experts say that cream skin could have been a response to \u2018Skip-Care\u2019, the more extreme version of the practice. After years of the popularity of the multi-step beauty routine, some young Koreans began to favour a more pared-back routine, suggesting that a simple cleanser and moisturiser could do the job of all the steps combined. The Skip-Care exercise also served as a cultural battle\u2014women began to fight against the notion that their femininity and self-worth was directly related to the translucence and beauty of their skin. Cream skin sits right in the middle\u2014it puts the best of K-beauty (the soothing toner and plumping moisturiser) into one all-in-one product that can help to brighten and hydrate skin, without the expense required to complete a more time-consuming routine. Is an essence the skincare step you\u2019ve been missing all along? South Korea is currently seeing a backlash against K-Beauty.
