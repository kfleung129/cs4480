    "text": "Style-hungry Hongkongers have developed a taste for fresh designs from Seoul, writes Divia Harilela There was a time when the rest of Asia looked to Japan for fashion trends. While the French and Italians were known for sophistication and luxurious craftsmanship, Tokyo brought an edgy street style inspired by areas such as Harajuku and Shinjuku. That has changed over the past decade in the wake of , or the Korean Wave, a tide of Korean television dramas and pop groups which gained popularity around the world. Much of Asia, including Hong Kong, couldn\u2019t get enough of all things Korean, whether it was its perfectly groomed pop groups, or the clothes they wore. \u201cCustomers are always looking for something that is adventurous and new, and Korean fashion offers that,\u201d says Tracey Cheng, merchandising manager at I.T. As with many trends, it started on the streets. Boutiques such as local chain JDC began stocking exports from Korea, and picked up on emerging Korean designers. Some online retailers such as chicystyle.com (an Asian version of Asos) kept selling out of cheap and chic styles inspired by Korean fashion. Unlike Japanese fashion trends, which are about creating your own style, Korean designs are subtle, with attention to cool details. Many designers take their inspiration from the West, rather than Asia. \u201cKorean fashion is mainly inspired by the European and US design aesthetic. It differs from the other Asian [labels], who tend to derive their aesthetic from traditional Asian culture and fashion,\u201d says Jeff Jun, managing director at Korean fashion retailer, Handsome Co. \u201cWe started selling this brand in 2010, and since then it\u2019s been my favourite. It continually surprises us, season after season, with its fashion-forward concept, distinctive tailoring, colours and themes. Its reasonable pricing is the key to its success,\u201d says Dorothy Hui, founder of Liger boutique in Causeway Bay. More recently, high-end brands have come to the fore. Many of these are already showcasing their work on an international platform, alongside established fashion houses at prominent fashion weeks. Among them is Lie Sang Bong, who was one of the first Korean designers to show at Paris Fashion Week. In 2002, he debuted East-meets-West looks that were inspired by Korean cultural motifs. They have been worn by Lady Gaga and Lindsay Lohan. The Juun J and Woogyoungmi brands have also shown in Paris, and feature casual yet utilitarian separates for men. \u201cAlthough the trend in Hong Kong was more towards the contemporary, there are also designers working in a more luxurious direction,\u201d says Lee. \u201cNow our main goal is to bring in more luxurious Korean designers in order to broaden the Korean fashion market in Hong Kong.\u201d So what is it about Korean designs that resonate with Asians? According to Justine Lee, a beauty executive and lover of Korean fashion, it all comes down to the aesthetic. \u201cI think Korean fashion is a good mix of European style and sophistication and Asian sensibility and practicality. It feels comfortable and effortless. Many of the designs do not feel overly dressy, and I like that,\u201d she says. Retailers point to superior quality and fit when compared to their Asian counterparts. The Koreans have become known for high quality and innovative fabrics, and an eye for detail whether it\u2019s decoration, or experimenting with fashion-forward looks. \u201cMost Korean designers like the inverted triangle shape \u2013 that is, volume or an oversized top and slim bottom. The workmanship is good, and their fit is suitable for Asia,\u201d says Michael Mok, general merchandising manager for Joyce. I.T\u2019s Cheng adds: \u201cThey have slimmer fits in the waist and slightly longer silhouettes (as they are a bit taller). \u201cAnd in terms of style, it would be more about contemporary streetwear and funky style, but they emphasise details such as embroideries and studs on garments, in order to make them look more than just casual streetwear.\u201d Designers to watch Margarin Fingers: launched in 2010, this line is all about fun graphics, colours and prints on cool separates. margarinfingers.com Steve J & Yoni P: selected as one of eight \u201cleading fashion designers of Korea\u201d by  Korea, the duo is known for high-end pieces injected with whimsy and funk. stevejandyonip.com Goen J: definitely on the sportier side, Goen J blends delicate fabrics and details with street wear shapes.
