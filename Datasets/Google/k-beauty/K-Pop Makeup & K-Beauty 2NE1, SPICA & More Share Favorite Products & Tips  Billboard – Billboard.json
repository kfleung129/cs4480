By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tCarson Griffith It\u2019s undeniable that K-pop\u00a0is taking over the world. YouTube reports viewership of K-pop videos has grown from around 700 million views in 2010 to more than 5.5 billion in 2013.

CL, Leader/Vocalist/Rapper for 2NE1  Your top beauty tip?\u00a0\u201c[I like] a strong eyeliner and I love playing with lip color\u201d Favorite makeup lines and products?\u00a0\u201cMaybelline eyeliner and mascara\u201d (full disclosure: she\u2019s a spokewoman for the company). Do you do your own makeup or do you use a makeup artist?\u00a0\u201cWhen I perform or have work, I get my makeup done by an artist\u201d What do you think the next hottest Korean product will be?\u00a0\u201cKorean lip tints, maybe\u201d 2. Jiwon, Singer for SPICA  Your top beauty tip?\u00a0\u201cI prefer to use tint rather than lipstick these days, Korean gals don\u2019t call it makeup when they put BB [blemish balm] cream and just tint only.\u201d Favorite makeup lines and products?\u00a0\u201cI love the brand Yves Saint Laurent and The Benefit. I usually put only tint from The Benefit when I\u2019m not wearing makeup.\u201d Do you do your own makeup or do you use a makeup artist? \u201cNormally, I do it by myself. Makeup artists help me when I need to perform on stage or be shown on TV.\u201d  What is your makeup style?\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t usually put on smokey makeup. For me, basic makeup is preferred. I\u2019d draw some shade on eyes, lines at the edge as my eyelids are thin and apply mascara all over.\u201d What do you think the next hottest Korean product will be? \u201cA nice cover and light-texture products are hot whether it\u2019s BB or CC creams. I like the all-in-one set pouch which is a pack of a foundation, a concealer and a set of power brushes. So, it helps me to finish it up at once.\u201d 3. Jeniffer Kim, YouTube Vlogger (meejmuse) and Korean TV Style Reporter  Your Top Beauty Tip?\u00a0\u201cMy holy grail Korean makeup items include Laneige Water Drop Lip Tints, Skinfood Tomato Cool Jelly Lip Tints, Holika Holika Aqua Petit Jelly BB Cream, Hera Sunmate Daily (Sunscreen), Clio Professional Kill Black Brush Eyeliner, Innisfree Waterproof Gel Pencil Liners, Banila Co CC Cream and the Laneige Pore Control BB Cushion.\u201d Favorite makeup lines and products? \u201cKorean makeup is amazing in that it is always innovative, new, creative, have unique colour ranges and also don\u2019t break your wallets. In other words, true value for money! My favourite Korean brands are Laneige, Hera, Skinfood, Innisfree and Clio Professional.\u201d  What do you think the next hottest Korean product will be? \u201cDefinitely the BB cushions and pacts\u2026The concept of \u2018cushion foundation\u2019 was born out of Korean makeup developers trying to make a BB cream that is quick and easy to apply and touch-up, and the idea was inspired from stamps. You basically \u2018stamp\u2019 the specially designed sponge into the cushion and dab it onto your face. It\u2019s so light that it only takes seconds, and there\u2019s no need for your hands to get dirty. You get moisturising coverage, SPF, BB properties all in one little mirrored pouch that you can also easily use to quickly and discreetly touch-up anywhere you are. The case is airtight for hygiene, refills and sponges are repurchasable, and there are so many on the market that there is definitely one for every skin type and preference. The most popular ones right now are from Laneige, Iope, Hera, Sulwhasoo and Innisfree. They say that once you try it, there\u2019s no going back to any other type of foundation. I warned you!\u201d Do you think there is any relation to the popularity of K-beaty to K-pop as well? \u201cIt is undeniable \u2014 the K-pop industry is an elephant in the room on the global scale. If a famous singer or celebrity is known to use a certain product, the beauty community braces itself for that product to be sold out for the next few weeks or so. With such loyal fans everywhere, the popularity of K-pop certainly is a huge driving force behind the beauty and cosmetics industry.\u201d A version of this article first appeared in the August 9th issue of Billboard Magazine Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.
