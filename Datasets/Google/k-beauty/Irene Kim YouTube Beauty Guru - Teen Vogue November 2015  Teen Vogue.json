    "text": "By Elaine Welteroth Irene Kim \u2014 model, edgy street-style star, and Est\u00e9e Lauder\u2019s global beauty contributor \u2014 is demo-ing the art of the DIY rice wrap live on my Snapchat from a Vietnamese restaurant in Seoul\u2019s posh Cheongdam-dong district. \u201cYou just fold it up like a little baby in a blanket,\u201d she says, smiling encouragingly. Her BFF and colorist, Sunwoo Kim, leans in to tag team, shoveling a kaleidoscope of veggies into my steamy rice paper. Clearly I\u2019m in good hands with this dynamic duo, who, aside from helping clumsy tourists, are beauty gurus in their own right, having famously refreshed the Technicolor ombr\u00e9 trend. What began as a haphazard quick fix for a case of \u201cblack-hair boredom\u201d has since blown up\u2014and taken Irene\u2019s modeling career with it. \u201cChanging my hair color really did change my life. I think it gave me that trademark,\u201d she says. However, Irene admits her agency wasn\u2019t very fond of the idea at first. \u201cThey feared I wouldn\u2019t get any work. But now people are like, \u2018Oh, my God, you are the girl with the rainbow hair!\u2019\u201d she exclaims. The front-row fixture and unofficial K-beauty ambassador, who grew up in both Seattle and Seoul, is making a name for herself in the West by helping to usher in the most relevant trends from the East. Reflecting on the perks of her international upbringing and its influence on her sartorial risk taking, Irene delivers an insightful outlook: \u201cIt\u2019s more courageous to change than to stay the same.\u201d Photographed by Clara Balzary, Fashion Stylist: Marissa Peden, Hair: Caile Noble using R+Co\nMakeup: Sandra Ganzer using CHANEL Hydra Beauty Micro Serum, Nails: Whitney Gibson for The System by Formula X in White Matter, Grey Matter Related: Watch Charli XCX Give Us Her 3 Ultimate Beauty Tips By Kara Nesvig By Ashleigh Carter By Kara Nesvig By Kara Nesvig More from Teen Vogue Contact \u00a9 2023 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
