    "text": "Racked is no longer publishing. Thank you to everyone who read our work over the years. The archives will remain available here; for new stories, head over to Vox.com, where our staff is covering consumer culture for The Goods by Vox. You can also see what we\u2019re up to by signing up here. Cushion compacts. BB creams. Face sheet masks. There's no denying it: Korean beauty products are officially mainstream. Who would have thought we'd be uttering this sentence on the regular: We need to stock up on snail cream. And although we wouldn't mind taking a trip to the source itself, it's really not necessary. San Francisco is home to several (seriously addictive) spots to buy the latest Korean beauty products. Here's our guide to the best; stores are listed from north to south. Have a favorite to add to the list? Let us know in the comments below. ",
