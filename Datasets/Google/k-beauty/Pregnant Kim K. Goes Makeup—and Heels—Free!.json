    "text": "At eight months pregnant, Kim Kardashian has finally let go of her glamorous look. And she's still just as gorgeous. The expectant E! star was spotted in Malibu Tuesday, where she was snapped sans makeup at The Vitamin Barn with brother Brandon Jenner and his wife, Leah Felder. Kanye West's other half looked relaxed and casual in comfy black leggings, flip-flops and a black zip-up jacket. She flaunted her flawless fresh face and her very pregnant belly, sporting a tight black top that flatters her bump.
