Only one other pair of the 1,290 precious stone-adorned\u00a0heels\u00a0has\u00a0been purchased ever. House of Borgezie\u00a0owner Chris Shellis was told Bey will\u00a0be wearing the shoes\u00a0in a new\u00a0music video\u00a0(!!!) out this fall.\u00a0\"It's the ultimate,\" he said. \"If you want someone to model your creations, you can't get any better than Beyonc\u00e9.\"\u00a0True. The heels, according to Shellis, \"are the crown jewels of stilettos. They're a bit like the 1960s E Type Jag\u2014it doesn't matter what you do, you're not going to improve on them.\" Along with the heels,\u00a0Bey reportedly\u00a0bought a\u00a0\u00a355,000 ($85,716)\u00a0gem-studded\u00a0gold basque belt from Jewellery Quarter for the video.
