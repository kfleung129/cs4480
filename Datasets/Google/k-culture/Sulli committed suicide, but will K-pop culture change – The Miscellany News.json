    "text": "Vassar College's student newspaper of record since 1866 By Yvette Hu Posted on October 31, 2019 in Opinions [CW: This article mentions suicide, depression and eating disorders.] I heard the news over breakfast with my friends at the Deece. \u201cDid you hear that Sulli committed suicide?\u201d For a moment, my mind went blank. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d were the first and only words that could burst out of my mouth. A mix of shock and anger sped through my veins and turned into a stirring sensation in my chest. On Oct. 14, 25-year-old South Korean singer and actor Sulli, legal name Choi Jin-ri, was found dead by her manager in her apartment south of Seoul. The police suspect a suicide, but are still investigating. (Metro, \u201cFormer f(x) star Sulli\u2019s cause of death confirmed suspected suicide,\u201d 10.14.2019). Within hours of the suicide, Sulli\u2019s manager, an employee of SM Entertainment, allegedly stated to the police that the young singer had suffered from severe depression (The Washington Post, \u201cHow a K-pop star\u2019s death reveals the truth about our society,\u201d 10.15.2019). Sulli was a former member of K-pop girl band f(x). Ever since she withdrew from the band to focus on a career in acting in 2015, she has been the target of online vitriol and gossip. First, she was condemned for selfishly quitting the band to pursue her solo career. Then her romantic relationship with singer Choiza\u2014who\u2019s 14 years her senior\u2014incited wild disapproval among netizens, who flooded her Instagram with hate messages (Channel Korea, \u201cWhat\u2019s Sulli and Choiza\u2019s Relationship Like Now, After Their Breakup?\u201d 04.27.2019). The commenters were not only uncomfortable with the relatively large age gap, but also angry that Sulli violated an unspoken rule that disallows K-pop idols to openly discuss their love lives. The fiercest wave of online verbal abuse hit Sulli after she posted a series of photos\u2014which the commenters called \u201ccrazy\u201d\u2014 showing her not wearing a bra. Opponents claimed that her photos were overly sexual and called her a \u201cpsycho.\u201d The rampant slut-shaming continued even after Sulli explained on the talk show \u201cThe Night of Hate Comments\u201d why she chose not to wear underwear. According to her, whether to wear underwear is her freedom, and underwear is not good for her health since the wired bra could cause problems with digestion (JTBC, \u201cThe Night of Hate Comments,\u201d 06.21.2019). Throughout her career, I was not a fan of Sulli and didn\u2019t follow her news actively. Yet, I involuntarily took in tons of news about her, as coverages on her popped out on a frequent basis online\u2014not just in South Korea but also in my home country of China. I came to ignore the constant coverage of Sulli because I never took an interest in pop news. I also chose to ignore it, I must admit, in an attempt to escape the side of me which struggled with a love-hate relationship with K-pop. Sulli\u2019s suicide reopened that valve for me, reminding me anew of the perils of K-pop culture. K-pop initially seized my attention when I was in middle school. Back then, I was a big fan of Bigbang and 2ne1, both bands under label YG Entertainment. I started listening to music produced by YG artists exclusively. The high-quality song production and charismatic stage manner of the company\u2019s groups stood out to me, when compared to other groups that focused more on the artists\u2019 cute and flawless appearance. I consciously set myself apart from those fans who fetishize their idols\u2019 appearance over everything else. But the more I was exposed to the whole scope of K-pop culture, the more I came to accept the beauty myth that the industry sold to me: that the only beauty standard for girls is to be skinny, that we should all have impeccable skin. In this world, bluntly put, girls are measured by their appearances: \u201cGood legs,\u201d \u201cant waist,\u201d \u201cright angle shoulders.\u201d Such vocabulary went beyond fan culture to invade my day-to-day life as I saw my peers commenting on each other\u2019s photo posts using these rudimentary metrics. You could easily find tons of videos online made by girls to document themselves following a certain K-pop idol\u2019s diet strategy. It took me years\u2014going through disordered eating and studying feminist theory\u2014to discern the toxicity of K-pop body culture on the mental and physical health of everybody involved, artists and fans alike. At first, I found it difficult to admit that something I was passionate about was built on the objectification of women. For a while, I cut myself off from almost all K-pop related content I used to watch or listen to because I couldn\u2019t reconcile my conflicted emotions. What was I consuming when I watched those music videos? What kind of reality am I bringing myself into? It is fortunate to see that intensified demands for more regulation of cyberbullying has forced the Korean government to take action against anonymous, hateful comments. Reportedly, the National Assembly claims they will begin debating a bill, already dubbed \u201cSulli\u2019s law,\u201d later this year (The Guardian, \u201cK-pop under scrutiny over \u2018toxic fandom\u2019 after death of Sulli,\u201d 10.18.2019). Nonetheless, online violence is not the single cause of Sulli\u2019s tragedy. Whether or not the press and government put more focus on punishing internet haters, the potential for the problematic K-showbusiness to remain unregulated is alarming. It is worth mentioning that SM Entertainment put Sulli under an intense working schedule, even when her depression had become more severe. (Jiemian, \u201cSulli\u2019s Suicide: Will Her Tragedy Become An Opportunity to Reflect On Cyber-violence and Entertainment Industry?\u201d 10.21.2019) Knowing that Sulli was dealing with depression, SM had her go on \u201cNight of the Hate Comments\u201d, and read out loud the bullying messages publicly, which made her re-experience all of the negative emotions. Besides Sulli\u2019s case, extreme diet regimens, grueling training schedules and the minimal privacy afforded to K-pop idols have gone under-discussed for years. In 2016, Oh My Girl\u2019s JinE announced that she would halt all onstage activities after being diagnosed with anorexia (The Korea Herald, \u201cDangerously skinny K-pop girl groups,\u201d 09.26.2016). Three years later, the industry still has not imposed regulations to address the severe diet culture within the industry. Losing weight continues to be an unspoken must when female and male idols come back with their new albums, as pressure rises from the companies, the culture and even the artists themselves. To cultivate a better behaved online public may be relatively easy, but to fuss with the business side\u2014where capital and politics are intertwined\u2014is way more risky. If the industry sticks with what it does right now, and no external force tries to intervene, will tragedies like Sulli\u2019s reoccur? That\u2019s a question, or rather a reality, to think about. I\u2019m so sad to hear about this.. tbh I didn\u2019t know Sulli that well, I\u2019ve only ever heard one of her songs but I could tell she had a unique personality and I don\u2019t get why people shamed her so much for her different choices!??\nShe can love who she wants to no matter the age gap, she can wear no underwear if she wants!! But people pls be more aware of how u say things and comment to idols bcoz they are just like as and they\u2019ve worked so so hard to try create the music that we love?\nHearing this and about how members of MONDTA X Wonho is leaving \u2026 makes me think differently about kpop.. I\u2019ve tried giving up on it many times but part of me can\u2019t and it\u2019s quite annoying ..\nAny way people just need to be more respectful, sulli probably had a few personal problems that no one knew of and she couldn\u2019t share it without feeling like hated on Pls be respectful to the people that try to make u happy and if u don\u2019t like what they have said or done then pls just leave ..:? We will miss u Sulli Just happened again!! Goo Hara of former Girl group Kara just committed suicide or so it appears. K-Pop industry has a major crisis now and that goes far beyond just YG\u2019s troubles. From bad management practices which are downright abuse in some cases. To a toxic Idol fan culture. Which would make any normal person think twice about jumping into an industry. Which in many cases can be a death sentence. But the K-Pop industry itself is in part to blame. Fostering an unhealthy culture which only further creates conditions ripe for abuse. What some of these Idols have to go through is inhuman.  Korean government needs to do more here as well. Stop the stigma of mental illness and start educating the public. R.I.P. Hara ? Your email address will not be published.
