Seeking and Evaluating Ancillary Revenue and Non-Traditional Opportunities\r\nWe will look to participate in new activities that expose the K-State brand to a broader audience through community events, entertainment, and revenue generating competitive opportunities. We will focus on department-wide initiatives that actively promote an inclusive and diverse community through educational programming and support of all populations. Our collective efforts will include: Increased Cultural Competency\r\nWe will make a concerted effort to provide relevant presentations and training on an annual basis to our student-athletes, coaches and staff. Diversity and inclusion education will be included in student-athlete orientations and new staff training and department all-staff programming. Our department will continue building on the existing relationships with the campus\u2019s academic and social multi-cultural student groups and the International Student Center, and we will continue to embrace our leadership role in participating in multi-cultural programming and events. Recruitment and Retention\r\nWe will actively and intentionally recruit a diverse student-athlete population. In addition, we will be diligent in our efforts to recruit a broad set of applicants for department staff and coaching positions, including using department personnel and national resources to create diverse hiring pools. Identification of Resources and Support for All\r\nTo provide a rewarding student-athlete experience, campus and department resources will be readily available to support all populations. We will also provide and promote professional development opportunities for coaches and staff through various intercollegiate organizations. Encouragement of International Student-Athletes\r\nWith student-athletes from more than 20 countries around the world, we recognize the importance of acclimating to a new country and to a different environment. We strive to make the transition seamless from providing appropriate resources to exposing the cultures of the student-athlete to the broader community. We are committed to integrity in compliance and will adhere to following these principles: Institutional Control & Head Coach Responsibility\r\nKansas State University is committed to maintaining institutional control by promoting a culture of compliance that emphasizes the shared responsibility among all staff members and student-athletes. Each staff member and non-staff member promoting the athletic interests at Kansas State University has the responsibility to ensure that they are acting in compliance with all NCAA, Big 12, and University requirements. All individuals shall understand their obligation to report any potential violations. Head coaches shall promote an atmosphere of compliance in their programs, communicate to their staff about the importance of compliance and monitor the activities of their staff members. Training and Education\r\nWe will take reasonable steps to provide regular and effective rules education by communicating applicable regulations, policies and procedures to all staff, student-athletes, donors and fans. Various methods of delivering educational resources will be utilized. Reasonable Policies and Procedures\r\nDepartment policies and procedures will be continually evaluated for effectiveness as well as to ensure that they are compliant with federal and state laws and NCAA, Big 12, institutional, and departmental rules and regulations. Policies and procedures will be implemented or updated appropriately and made readily available to all staff. We will take seriously our obligation to regularly educate department personnel on anti-discrimination and whistleblower protection policies. Commitment to Compliance\r\nThe President is responsible for the overall administration of the institution, which includes the athletic department. The director of athletics will exercise oversight of the compliance program and delegate authority to the compliance staff, which shall be appropriately supported and empowered to fulfill their obligation of administering an effective and ethical compliance program.
