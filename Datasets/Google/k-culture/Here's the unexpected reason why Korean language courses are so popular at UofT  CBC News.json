    "text": "The University of Toronto has seen a big spike in enrolment in Korean language studies in recent years largely due to the rising popularity of K-pop, according to a professor in the school's East Asian studies department. \"We only had 30 students in our first year of classes 10 years ago . Now we've got 150, with double that on the waiting list,\" said Andre Schmidt on\u00a0Metro Morning\u00a0Monday. Some concert-goers demand refund after calling Hallyu North K-pop festival a 'chaotic mess' \"It's about\u00a0K-pop\u00a0music...then students get interested in Korean historical dramas and\u00a0get interested in the culture more generally. Korean food is also getting more popular.\" Schmidt said his students are a diverse group of people from all over Canada and the world. \"I'll have a student who grew up in a farm town in Grey County in rural Ontario. She'll sit beside an international student from Beijing. They'll be beside someone who grew up in downtown Toronto speaking Greek or Italian and they'll be beside a third generation Korean-Canadian who, because of this music, wants to learn the language of their grandparents,\" he said.  Another contributing\u00a0factor to the spike in popularity, which according to Schmidt is not just a Toronto phenomena but happening all over North America, is the booming Korean economy. \"Many of our students that graduate go on and get jobs in Korea,\" he said. \"K-pop is a phenomena of the growing importance of the Korean economy. It's a big industrial effort that's getting people around the world interested and it transfers into jobs for people.\" Schmidt, who teaches the Korean language and history of both North Korea\u00a0and South Korea, said he had to add\u00a0a lecture to his course to talk about the\u00a0internationalization\u00a0of Korean culture.

So we're scrambling a little bit to accommodate all of this interest.\" For those whose interest may just be beginning to pique, Schmidt admits Korean isn't an easy language to master.    \"It's a difficult language to learn but all you have to do is go to Korea town and start ordering some food and practicing it and you'll pick it up soon enough.\"  Producer, CBC Toronto Ramna Shahzad is a multi-media producer and reporter in the CBC Toronto newsroom.
