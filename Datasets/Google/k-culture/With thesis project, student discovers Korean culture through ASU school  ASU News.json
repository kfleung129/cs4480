    "text": "The Korean department at Arizona State University's School of International Letters and Cultures (SILC) is one of the college\u2019s fastest growing programs, with more students benefiting every year. Senior Simon Huynh, in pursuit of his thesis project, found out exactly what that growth and energy meant. \u201cI originally got involved with SILC on a recommendation to find an honors thesis director,\u201d Huynh said. \"SILC has a very open faculty, willing to help you. Their level of expertise is very high.\u201d \n\nSimon Huynh used School of International Letters and Cultures classes to explore Korean culture for his thesis project. \nDownload Full Image\n\nHuynh\u2019s thesis project for Barrett, The Honors College, analyzes how Korean popular culture, or K-pop music, is influenced by videos, livestreams and reality television. \u201cThe goal of my thesis was to see how various social media tools generate a very interactive, very invested fan base for K-pop. Something very unique about K-pop is how organized the fans are around a particular group,\u201d Huynh explained. He said this ranges from active fan clubs to wide-scale donations in a band\u2019s name. Huynh himself has listened to K-pop since middle school, but realized his interest had thesis potential after learning about Professor Jiwon Shin\u2019s class on Korean popular culture. Shin became Huynh\u2019s director. \u201cStudying culture enables you to obtain and widen your lens of perception,\u201d Huynh said. \u201cYou\u2019re able to see people for who they are. In my study of Korean culture, I\u2019ve come to appreciate both the differences and the similarities between my original culture \u2026\u00a0Vietnamese American.\u201dHuynh credits his thesis and Shin with helping him become more aware of other cultures and more empathetic of cultural differences. In the future, students can get even more out of the Korean department than Huynh was able to, thanks to the addition of a Korean minor to SILC degree options. The Korean minor will empower students to explore technological, economic and political realities tied in with Korean language and culture. Korea is at the center of geopolitical, security and global conversations. SILC wants students to be part of those conversations. \u201cMy professors are actually trying to help me publish my thesis,\u201d Huynh said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a huge step I didn\u2019t consider, but they want to help me build that step. \u2026 It\u2019s important for me to share my culture and understand other people\u2019s culture.\u201d \u201cI originally got involved with SILC on a recommendation to find an honors thesis director,\u201d Huynh said. \"SILC has a very open faculty, willing to help you.

Last semester, two Arizona State University students in Jewish studies courses used their final project assignments as opportunities for creative expression, exhibiting the material that they learned in their courses through art and music.Rather than simply writing a research paper on a topic of Judaism that their class had studied during the semester, students Alison Sigala and Samuel Opie channeled their talents and areas of academic study, producing something truly unique.                        \n\nStudent Alison Sigala channeled medieval art for her scroll project depicting images from the Hebrew Bible. \nDownload Full Image\n\nSigala is an intermediate art majorin the Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts who is passionate about studying and producing art, such as drawings. Opie is a Russian language major and interested in Russian history and culture. He also sings for an a cappella group, writes songs and creates music.\nHistory lecturer Timothy Langille, who teaches courses on the Hebrew Bible and Jewish history at ASU's School of Historical, Philosophical and Religious Studies, said these two students definitely went above and beyond the final project requirements.While taking REL/JST 315: Hebrew Bible, Sigala crafted a highly elaborate scroll with medieval-like art, which portrays the stories from the first two chapters of Ezekiel in the Hebrew Bible. It also relates to one of the units discussed in this class, \u201cbook cultures versus scroll cultures,\u201d according to Langille.\u00a0Sigala is fascinated by art from the classical and Renaissance eras and \u201cflipping stereotypes on their heads.\u201d Most works of art during these historical periods consist of impeccable and \u201cpretty\u201d images portraying biblical events using things like head-halos and gold-leaf art, Sigala said. Yet, the scroll, which she created on mulberry printmaking paper using acrylic paints and sharpie ink, is a lot more raw and visceral with its colors and imagery.Her artwork depicts the biblical scene of Ezekiel receiving an incredible vision from God, who calls him to become a prophet. In this story about Ezekiel\u2019s journey, \u201cit's really hard to imagine that, from words to actual pictures, because it\u2019s described very strangely,\u201d Sigala said. Ezekiel receives a scroll from God and then eats it, and Sigala said this inspired her to use a scroll and artistically represent how this vision would actually look.From the top to the bottom of the scroll, Sigala took the events described in Ezekiel and chronologically translated the language into a visually captivating representation.The \u201cCall to Prophecy\u201d from Ezekiel 1 contains some of the most \u201cover-the-top imagery in the Hebrew Bible,\u201d in Langille\u2019s opinion. \u201cSo to actually conceptualize it and produce this is pretty amazing,\u201d he said.Opie, who was taking the course HST/JST 230: Intro to Jewish Civilization, used an online computer program to write sheet music dedicated to one of the poems written about the Russian pogroms that erupted in 1903. \"Upon the Slaughter,\" written by famed Hebrew poet Hayim Nahman Bialik, is based on the deadly anti-Jewish riots that occurred in Kishinev, which was the capital of the Russian Empire at the time.Opie included four different vocal parts in his sheet music: soprano, alto, tenor and bass.\u00a0Langille was thrilled when he realized they were channeling what they learned in class into original forms of art.\u201cIt shows they care,\" he said. \"It\u2019s exciting for a professor.
