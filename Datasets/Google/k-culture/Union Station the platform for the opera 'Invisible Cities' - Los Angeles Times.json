    "text": "The idea of a headphone opera was hatched over drinks at a downtown Mexican bar. The production design was partly inspired by flash mobs and silent disco. And the setting won\u2019t be a proscenium theater, but the majestically melancholy Union Station train terminal in downtown Los Angeles. These are someways in which Saturday night\u2019s world premiere performance of \u201cInvisible Cities\u201d won\u2019t be a conventional night at the opera, and why the audience it attracts likely won\u2019t be conventional either. CHEAT SHEET: Fall arts preview Written by New York composer Christopher Cerrone, with a text adapted from Italo Calvino\u2019s shimmering, philosophical novel of the same name, \u201cInvisible Cities\u201d is being presented by the Industry, the aesthetically renegade L.A.-based opera company led by Yuval Sharon, and L.A. Dance Project, the artist collective co-founded by choreographer-dancer Benjamin Millepied. For the site-specific production, the roughly 200 audience members will wear wireless headphones. The eight singers\u2019 voices and the 11 musicians\u2019 instruments will be beamed directly to listeners, as if whispering in their ears. Meanwhile, the performers, including eight dancers, gradually will reveal themselves to the audience as the 70-minute, intermission-less work progresses \u201cIt will be up to the audience to decide how they see it, if they go into certain rooms, or if they decide to just stay in one place and let the opera pass them by,\u201d says Sharon, 34. PHOTOS: Arts and culture in pictures by The Times Since it was founded three years ago, the Industry has been attracting a young, diverse constituency whose members may be more accustomed to attending Burning Man and EDM raves than an umpteenth staging of \u201cMadame Butterfly.\u201d Chad Smith, vice president of artistic planning for the Los Angeles Philharmonic, says that the Industry has added an important new dimension to the region\u2019s operatic ecosystem. \u201cYuval is doing something that the L.A. Phil and L.A. Opera can\u2019t do,\u201d Smith says. \u201cHe is staging this work in such a unique way for a very limited audience that becomes experiential because it\u2019s happening outside of a traditional opera company or a traditional orchestra, and outside of a traditional venue.\u201d The Industry\u2019s signature approach combines 21st century technology, multi-disciplinary postmodern staging, site-specific production design and eclectic, avant-garde scores. RELATED: A tour of L.A. boulevards Its 2012 coming-out production, staged in an Atwater Crossing warehouse, was \u201cCrescent City,\u201d the voodoo-haunted \u201chyper-opera\u201d by composer Anne LeBaron and Douglas Kearneythat included giant video screens transmitting live imagery of the action from hand-held cameras. Last spring, at the Hammer Museum, the Industry unveiled six operatic works-in-progress for its inaugural First Take series, a West Coast version of the VOX series that Sharon ran for New York City Opera before he moved to Los Angeles. The \u201cInvisible Cities\u201d production team, most in their late 20s or early 30s, know that the opera has a technological gee-whiz factor that makes it a lure for the city\u2019s young, creative classes. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a collection that starts with people that have never seen an opera show in their lives, together with people that are ongoing opera fans,\u201d says Danielle Agami, the production\u2019s choreographer. PHOTOS: LA Opera through the years But the collaborators emphasize that their aim isn\u2019t simply to dangle hipster-bait for denizens of downtown and Echo Park. \u201cOpera has always been a wonderful opportunity to work with technology because it provides a dramatic rationale to do so,\u201d Cerrone says. \u201cSo we\u2019re not adding headphones because it\u2019s cool, although it is, but because we\u2019re trying to find a new way into experiencing a dramatic work.\u201d \u201cInvisible Cities\u201d came about organically through an old-fashioned, decidedly low-tech ritual: an after-work chat in 2011 at La Cita bar, the Hill Street watering hole, between Sharon and E. Martin Gimenez, the Industry\u2019s chief sound designer, following an L.A. Opera production of \u201cThe Turn of the Screw.\u201d Gimenez proposed the idea of doing a headphone opera, a concept that originated with silent discos, in which dancers wear headphones that allow them to hear DJs spinning records in an otherwise audio-free dance hall. The technology already had been co-opted by theatrical groups such as London\u2019s Punchdrunk, which used it for an adaptation of \u201cMacbeth.\u201d Gimenez suggested using it for a site-specific opera production at an art-friendly location such as the Getty Villa or LACMA. But Sharon proposed Union Station. That left one question: which opera? Sharon had known about \u201cInvisible Cities\u201d since Cerrone submitted an early version of it to the VOX series in 2009 . Like Calvino\u2019s book, Cerrone\u2019s opera posits an imaginary conversation between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo, in which the Venetian explorer mentally conjures the great cities of the aging Khan\u2019s empire. Lyrical and intensely inward-looking, the book slowly pulls the reader into its ruminative head space. \u201cI know it sounds like some sort of sound bite, but I literally read the first page, thought it was gorgeous, and started playing the first notes of the overture,\u201d Cerrone says. Sharon, however, was skeptical. \u201cMy first thought was, This is never going to work as an opera,because it\u2019s so perfect as a book, and it\u2019s a literary experience.\u201d Yet, as soon as Sharon began studying Cerrone\u2019s piece, with its non-linear narrative structure and falling-note harmonics that seemed to decay in mid-air, he realized that the composer had succeeded in capturing the introspective, otherworldly atmosphere of Calvino\u2019s story. In June 2012, he sent Cerrone a Facebook message proposing \u201cInvisible Cities\u201d as The Industry\u2019s follow-up to \u201cCrescent City.\u201d Sharon and Cerrone believe that Union Station, as an architectural nexus of Jazz Age optimism and high-speed-rail futurism, and with its constant ebb and flow of transient humanity, is the ideal location for an opera about real and imaginary destinations. \u201cWhat I\u2019m actually hoping,\u201d says Cerrone with a laugh, \u201cis that the weirdness of the audience will counter-act the weirdness\u201d of the performers. reed.johnson@latimes.com ----------------------------- \u2018Invisible Cities\u2019 Where: Union Station, downtown L.A.
