    "text": "In a college town with a variety of available activities, swing dancing is a hobby for many students. For Weihao \u201cKraken\u201d Zheng, junior in history and journalism, a dance that once seemed foreign and consists of lifts, spins and flips is now a passion. According to Google Maps, Zheng is over 6,500 miles away from home. He grew up in Beijing, China, but has been immersed in American culture for the past four years. \u201cMy first year at K-State, I was living in the dorms,\u201d Zheng said. \u201cThat is actually the first time I found out about swing dancing. I had studied tango before and had a little bit of knowledge about dancing, but not swing dancing.\u201d Zheng said he met the people living on his floor in his residence hall and quickly realized just how different cultures can be. \u201cI would hang out with several girls on the floor, and when it was time to say goodbye late at night, they would come and give me a hug,\u201d Zheng said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even remember their names yet, and that made me feel very awkward.\u201d Zheng said his friends in the dorms recognized how shy he was at first and decided they needed to expose him more to American culture and help bring him out of his shell. \u201cThey took me to Dirty Dawgs,\u201d Zheng said.  \u201cAt first I thought I would be dancing with the girls from my dorm, but then they told me that they were not going to be dancing with me and that I needed to dance with people I did not know.\u201d He said dancing an unfamiliar dance with unfamiliar people is what inspired him to start practicing swing dancing. \u201cI learned about swing dancing club, which is every Monday night in the Union,\u201d Zheng said. \u201cThe first year, I joined club and began studying the dance, and then I soon began spending basically every weekend at Dirty Dawgs.\u201d In 2014, Zach Langford, coach and choreographer of the Swinging Spurs, approached Zheng and encouraged him to try out for the team. Zheng said he decided to accept their offer. \u201cThis was the first time I had joined a team,\u201d Zheng said. \u201cIn China, in primary or elementary school, middle school and high school we did not have those kinds of opportunities.\u201d Zheng said Chinese schools differ from American schools in many ways. In contrast to class structure in America, where students have each class in a different room with a different set of classmates, Zheng said Chinese students are assigned to one classroom with about 15 classmates and one teacher. \u201cWe had a physical education class that consisted of a little running so that we did not stay in the classroom all day, but we did not actually have a sports team,\u201d Zheng said. \u201cSome schools do, but mine did not. We focused more on studying.\u201d Zheng, who is an only child, said he did not have a lot of experience with different kinds of people growing up, especially with people around his own age. Donita Whitney-Bammerlin, director of the Swinging Spurs and faculty adviser to the country two-step club, said Zheng brings great diversity to the team. \u201cIt is fabulous having him on the team,\u201d Whitney-Bammerlin said. \u201cHe is the type of individual that has acclimated and gotten involved in the Midwest American culture beyond what I could do if I were in China or if the tables were turned.\u201d Courtney Stover, senior in animal sciences and industry,  said Zheng brings great diversity and fun to the team. \u201cHe is a wild card,\u201d Stover said. \u201cHis personality doesn\u2019t fit in a particular category because he is a little bit of everything.\u201d Zheng said joining the Swinging Spurs has provided him with a good sense of community. \u201cMany of the times we can joke and be really ridiculous, but when something happens and someone needs help, we are always there for each other,\u201d Zheng said. He also said that being a member of the Swinging Spurs has opened the door to many opportunities. Zheng said the team has performed at their choreographer\u2019s wedding, traveled to competitions in several different states and performed at K-State sporting events. \u201cLast April, our team traveled to Chicago, Illinois, to compete at a competition,\u201d Zheng said. \u201cIt was our first competition, and we won first overall.\u201d Zheng said his family supports his involvement with Swinging Spurs, but is also a little concerned. \u201cWhen my family heard that I lift up girls up to the sky, they were a little worried,\u201d Zheng said. \u201cThey are worried that I might break my back or injure myself, but overall, my mother is happy about it because I can finally do a sport.\u201d Whitney-Bammerlin said she is amazed by what Zheng has accomplished on the team. \u201cHe is self-taught and is always interested in learning,\u201d Whitney-Bammerlin said. \u201cHe is not afraid to get out of his comfort zone.\u201d Zheng said he has always had a passion for learning about different cultures and is currently studying French, reads history books and learns new things every day. He also said he loves traveling in the U.S. \u201cThis summer, I went on a really long road trip \u2014 I drove about 6,000 miles,\u201d Zheng said. \u201cI traveled from here to Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, Arizona and back through Colorado to Kansas.\u201d Zheng said he plans on traveling more during the upcoming summer. \u201cI will probably travel by myself or find a friend to travel with me,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cSometimes I enjoy the alone time though.\u201d Zheng said he has learned a lot about American culture from traveling and studying here. \u201cCultures are always different,\u201d Zheng said. \u201cIf I were to point out something that was the most different here in America, I would say that the people here are really generous.\u201d ",
