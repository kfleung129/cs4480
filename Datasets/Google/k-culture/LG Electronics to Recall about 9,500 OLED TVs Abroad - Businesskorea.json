    "text": "LG Electronics announced on Sept. 28 that it will voluntarily recall a total of 9,434 OLED TVs of 13 models in Asia and Europe where power is 220 volts. The company will replace the power boards of the products as they have been found to generate heat. It explained that the current control function of the power boards in some products does not work properly. If heat is generated from a power board, which supplies electricity, the TV may be turned off, and its rear panel may turn black in part. Earlier in July, LG Electronics recalled a total of 60,000 OLED TVs of 18 models in Korea after discovering the heat generation problem. The company decided to expand the recall to overseas countries after finding similar problems in products sold abroad. In these countries, the recall will be carried out in consultation with related agencies. Never miss another article! Enter your email address below to receive our free daily newsletter: ",
