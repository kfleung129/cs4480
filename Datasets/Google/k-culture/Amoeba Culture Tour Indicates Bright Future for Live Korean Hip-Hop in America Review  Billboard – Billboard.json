By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJeff Benjamin Thanks to the likes of PSY, Wonder Girls and Girls\u2019 Generation, Korean pop is selling more music and holding more tours in overseas territories, including America. While Korean hip-hop isn\u2019t at the same visibility level as K-pop, the 2015 Amoeba Culture Tour\u00a0proved\u00a0promise for its future touring endeavors.

The stage was simple, but impressed with its towering LED screen-clad DJ booth towards the back. Korea\u2019s DJ Friz opened the show with a set before Crush opened the show. The young rapper/singer got the crowd shrieking with his falsetto notes and body rolls.

Soon enough, Dynamic Duo\u2019s Gaeko joined the duo for \u201cMeet,\u201d which led into DD\u2019s Choiza joining for \u201c? (Question Mark).\u201d Even with slight mic and feedback issues, there was a new energy as the MCs traded verses and bounced around onstage. Dynamic Duo Reflect on 14 Years in K-Pop: Exclusive Q&A Dynamic Duo eventually closed out the strong setlist with a half-dozen of their own hits (including \u201cBAAAM,\u201d \u201cGo Back\u201d and \u201cFireworks\u201d), inspiring chants, hollers and shouts from crowdgoers. But the show\u2019s encore brought every act on the bill out to return to perform DD classic \u201cFriday Night\u201d in what was undoubtedly the most fun and memorable performance of the night. There wasn\u2019t a flashy stage setup and the artists barely interacted with the audience in English \u2014 talking to them more or less only in Korean in between songs \u2014 but fans were no less turnt up. Korean hip-hop may not have the gloss and high-flying choreography like K-pop boy bands, but the Amoeba Culture crew proved that they could get a crowd just as pumped by including aspects of rarely seen collaboration stages.
