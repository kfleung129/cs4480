    "text": "By Kim Jae-heun The South Korean government\u2019s new guidelines for local broadcasters and TV show producers have sparked controversy over a suggestion that they refrain from showing too many K-pop stars that have similar appearances. The Ministry of Gender Equality and Family released the revised guidelines on Saturday in an effort to prevent \u201clookism\u201d, or prejudice on the grounds of a person\u2019s appearance. One of the clauses recommends restricting the number of idol singers appearing on a TV show at any given time, saying this could promote narrow standards of beauty among young viewers who admire K-pop groups. \u201cAre the singers on TV music shows twins? They seriously look identical. Most are idol group members,\u201d the guidelines say. \u201cMost of them are skinny and have similar hairstyles and make-up with outfits exposing their bodies.\u201d However, some observers questioned whether the government was attempting to regulate beauty standards. Ha Tae-keung, of the minor opposition Bareunmirae Party, wrote in a Facebook post: \u201cThe gender ministry says K-pop idols should not star together on television because they are all skinny and pretty with pale skin. What\u2019s the difference between this and the crackdowns on the length of hair and skirts during the military dictatorship of Chun Doo-hwan?\u201d The politician said the matter was one of individual taste, not something to be regulated by the government. But others said they understood the intent behind the guidelines, adding that outfits worn by some girl-group members were too sexual. \u201cI agree with the ministry\u2019s efforts to make changes in broadcasting scenes where commercialisation of sex is prevalent,\u201d an internet user said. The ministry said on Monday that the guidelines were only aimed at raising awareness about the negative effects of \u201clookism\u201d, adding that the recommendations were not mandatory and TV producers could decide whether to follow them.
