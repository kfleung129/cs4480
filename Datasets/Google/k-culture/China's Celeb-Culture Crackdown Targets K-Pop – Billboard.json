    "text": "Due to \"star-chasing behavior\" Weibo suspended 22 K-pop fan accounts for 30 days, including five for NCT, four related to BTS and three supporting Blackpink. By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tHsiuwen Liu HONG KONG \u2014 In April, a Chinese fan group dedicated to BTS member Jimin set out to give the K-pop star a special 26th birthday present: a customized commercial airplane. Through an account with 1.1 million followers on Weibo, China\u2019s leading social media platform, the group says it crowdfunded over 1 million yuan ($155,000) in three minutes to wrap a Jeju Air jet with photos of the star, which would act as a giant, flying billboard. But after the fan group posted pictures of the Jimin-adorned jet on Aug. 31, the Chinese government suspended the account for 60 days, claiming the fans had raised the funds \u201cillegally.\u201d Within hours, Weibo said that due to online complaints about \u201cirrational star-chasing behavior,\u201d it would also suspend 21 other K-pop fan accounts for 30 days, including five for NCT, four related to BTS, three supporting Blackpink and three for EXO.  The suspensions reflect the latest diplomatic tension between China and South Korea, as well as a broader tightening of control by China\u2019s Communist Party over the cultural and political sphere. After months of regulatory action to stem the growing scale and influence of tech companies \u2014 including Tencent Music Entertainment \u2014 the government has now set its sights on taming \u201cfan club chaos,\u201d which it says is exacerbating cyberbullying and rumors among minors. As a result, artists and their followers will now face stringent censorship and penalties if they run afoul of authorities. On Aug. 27, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the government\u2019s internet watchdog, announced 10 measures to \u201cclean up\u201d celebrity fan clubs, including banning celebrity rankings based on popularity. Tencent\u2019s QQ Music service also said it would restrict customers from purchasing more than one download of an album. Then on Sept. 2, China\u2019s State Administration of Radio, Film and Television banned \u201ceffeminate\u201d boy bands from starring in TV and online idol talent shows. While K-pop album sales in China account for less than 2% of global revenue for the four biggest South Korean entertainment firms \u2014 SM Entertainment, HYBE, YG Entertainment and JYP Entertainment \u2014 securities analysts say, Chinese-based fan groups generate thousands of sales of physical albums and digital downloads through their sprawling networks. Exports of Korean albums from January to November of 2020 soared 78% from 2019 to a record value of $123 million, according to the Korea Customs Service. Total Korean music exports to China were $16 million (13%), which fell from second place to third after the U.S. at $17 million and Japan, the perennial export recipient, at $60 million. (The data was based on physical CDs and DVDs; digital downloads and streams were not included.) A week after the Chinese internet watchdog\u2019s announcement, SM Entertainment, HYBE, YG Entertainment and JYP Entertainment\u2019s share prices had fallen by 1.68%, 0.89%, 4.74% and 2.9%, respectively. The Chinese government seems particularly concerned that the country\u2019s idol-fan culture is emulating that of K-pop, including such behaviors as inducing minors to raise funds, contest vote-rigging and the flaunting of wealth and extravagance. Across the world, K-pop fans have become powerful forces in driving sales and chart success for artists, and industry sources say music companies have come to expect that fan economy to generate a certain amount of additional revenue. \u201cLabels are freaking out\u201d about China\u2019s fan-group crackdown, says Alex Taggart, the head of international for Outdustry, an industry services company that operates in China. \u201cThey were really relying on that revenue.\u201d (The major multinational record labels and K-pop entertainment companies declined to discuss the topic with Billboard.) The actions threaten to slow the development of China\u2019s highly engaged fan culture. The size of the country\u2019s idol-generated economy \u2014 the amount of money driven by fan groups and their purchases \u2014 is expected to reach 100 billion yuan ($15 billion) by the end of this year, more than double the 45 billion yuan ($7 billion) of 2018 (which was a 60% jump from 2017), according to research by Owhat, a Chinese e-commerce platform. That vastly outweighs China\u2019s recorded-music revenue, which IFPI reported to be $791.9 million in 2020. Weibo has been the main driving force, with over 500 million active monthly users as of this year. In 2011, the social media platform made a focused effort to invite celebrities to join and interact with their followers, says Yin Yiyi, associate professor of media and cultural studies at Beijing Normal University. By 2019, most popular artists and actors had at least 20 million followers on the site, with some like Jackson Yee counting over 88 million devotees. \u201cThe emergence of the K-pop-style idol industry in China [coincides] with the rise of its social media platforms,\u201d says Bai Meijiadai, a lecturer at Liaoning University in northeastern China who studies fan culture.\u202fChinese fan culture is a form of \u201cdata labor,\u201d she says. \u2018Milk Waste\u2019 Scandal Leads To Fandom Crackdown As in South Korea, fan groups are known for their loyalty and lavish spending, from launching campaigns to boost their idol\u2019s social media rankings, to buying multiple copies of their albums \u2014 and sometimes over-the-top activities. In 2018, Chinese pop star-actor Kris Wu made headlines when his debut solo album, Antares, knocked Ariana Grande off the iTunes U.S. music chart. Investigations by iTunes and Nielsen Music found that his fans had worked together to buy his albums in bulk to push up sales. Then in May, a popular Chinese talent show, Youth With You 3, encouraged viewers to buy milk and scan a QR code to support their favorite artists on the show \u2014 leading fans to waste an estimated 270,000 bottles during the campaign, according to Chinese media reports. The \u201cmilk waste\u201d scandal, as the Chinese media dubbed it, caught the eye of the country\u2019s internet watchdog, leading the CAC to decide it was time to start regulating China\u2019s entertainment sector, analysts say. In June, it began its \u201cClear and Bright\u201d campaign targeting online fan groups. The restrictive Chinese measures will likely have a limited impact on K-pop entertainment businesses, which saw robust earnings in the first half of the year in part from the diversification of fan-based business models, says Jeong-yeob Park, analyst at Mirae Asset Securities, a South Korean investment bank. Restrictions caused by the 2016 THAAD missile issue \u2014 Beijing has been upset over Washington\u2019s agreement with Seoul to build a missile defense system to protect South Korea from North Korean attacks \u2014 and now the COVID-19 pandemic, were already cutting into K-pop\u2019s business in China, industry sources say. \u201cWe view the latest crackdown as a \u2018storm in a teacup\u2019 in a market where reliability and dependence had already been eroded,\u201d Park writes in a recent report. The missile defense system \u2013 which the U.S. upgraded in early 2020 \u2013 led China to block Korean TV shows and K-pop music videos from streaming in China. The move to regulate fandom was \u201ccaused by slowing economic growth and worsening public sentiment caused by COVID-19,\u201d says Danny Lee, director at Beat Interactive, a South Korean record label. \u201cWhat the Communist Party is most afraid of is the recurrence of Tiananmen Square, and now the strongest clusters and solidarity in China are fan clubs, so it can be thought that they are trying to prevent the spark of any \u2018uncontrolled energy\u2019 from collecting them in advance.\u201d For now, fan groups and Weibo seem to be heeding the government\u2019s regulatory orders. Responding to its punishment over the Jimin plane incident, the BTS member\u2019s fan group called on its following \u201cto be civilized, follow stars rationally \u2026 and build a harmonious and healthy online environment.\u201d Weibo said in a statement that it \u201cfirmly opposes such irrational star-chasing behavior and will deal with it seriously,\u201d vowing to \u201cintensify\u201d its policing of fan culture to \u201cpurify\u201d online discussions and \u201cregulate community order\u201d on its platform.
