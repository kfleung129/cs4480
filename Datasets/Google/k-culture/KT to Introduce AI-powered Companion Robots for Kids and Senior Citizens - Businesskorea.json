Under this agreement, the four companies will develop and commercialize next-generation AI companion robots for kids and senior citizens by combining their expertise in AI, telecommunications, robots and content. Stage Five is an affiliate of Kakao that specializes in telecommunication and the Internet of Things (IoT). It will be in charge of developing specialized content for AI companion robots by age group. Nuwa Robotics is a global social robot company that specializes in hardware such as robotic joints and robot software of its own development. Stage Five and Nuwa Robotics established a partnership in April to tap into the global robot market. The agreement is expected to create greater synergies. Ashoka Korea is the Korean branch of Ashoka, a global non-profit organization based in the United States engaged in discovering and supporting social innovation entrepreneurs to solve social problems. Ashoka Korea's participation is expected to add social value to contents to be used in AI companion robots. Through this business agreement, the four companies will release AI companion robots in the first half of 2021. The AI companion robots will provide customized services for kids and senior citizens using their moving arms and heads and Giga Genie AI-based interactive contents. Contents for kids will consist of services that can increase children's physical activities by utilizing AI robots' dynamic moves, not general learning and play-oriented contents. Senior contents will include providing care to people with dementia, becoming companions to chat with, giving medication guides, and other contents for active senior citizens. Senior citizens will be able to use the service through a simple voice command. Never miss another article! Enter your email address below to receive our free daily newsletter: ",
