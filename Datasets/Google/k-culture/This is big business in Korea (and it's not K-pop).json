Some 29,500 golf clubs were sold in the first four months  of this year at major golf club chain stores in South Korea, a  retail audit of golf club sales by market research firm GfK  shows. That was 5,000 more compared with the same time last  year. According to the report, published earlier this month, a  consistent upward trend in the sales volume of golf clubs during  the same period over the past three years shows that a fixation  with golf in the north Asian economy has become more  widespread. Read MoreWhat do South Korea and India  have in common? \"Whereas golf was once deemed a prestigious activity only  afforded by the rich and more sophisticated group of people, it  has in recent times evolved to become a relatively inexpensive  pastime that can be enjoyed by the mass,\" said Chang KyungEun,  managing director for GfK in Korea. Analysts say rising golf-club sales also tell a story about  the country's consumers: after years of striving to develop its  economy, South Koreans are now more willing to  spend their hard-earned cash on leisure. South Korea is Asia's fourth biggest economy and in many  respects it's regarded as a developed economy after  years of rapid growth. It became a member of the Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development in 1996. Read MoreFood and fashion:How  K-drama is influencing Asia \"Golf is something more and more Koreans aspire to and one  thing we find is that as Korea becomes more affluent, leisure  spending has certainly increased,\" said Frederic Neumann, the  co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC. \"It's almost an encouraging sign that Koreans are learning  to chill. They are a nation of hard working people who have for  decades strived to get their economy into the top ranks of the  world,\" he added. The World Tourism Organization expects leisure travel  spending in South Korea to grow by 4.6 percent a year by 2023. It  grew an estimated 2.3 percent last year.

Obsession Golf is hugely popular in South Korea \u2013 both as sport  and for networking. In fact, local media reported last year that amid increased  provocation from North Korea, South Korea's top military chiefs  played golf \u2013 something the government was reportedly  looking into. According to GfK, Korean, Japanese and U.S. manufacturers  dominate the South Korean golf market, which is made up of over  40 brands. GfK says the past year has seen consumers swing in preference  towards Korean and Japanese brands, which managed to grow their  volume share in the market by 61 and 4 percent, at the expense of  U.S. brands. Read MoreTiger is back, but can he come back? Some Korean sports brands are certainly benefiting from the  trend. Shares in Seoul-listed sports firm Fila have risen roughly 40  percent over the last year and are up over 20 percent so far this  year, outpacing the broader South Korean market, which is up just  0.2 percent.
