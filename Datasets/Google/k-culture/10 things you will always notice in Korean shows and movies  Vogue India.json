With Bong Joon Ho\u2019s Parasite\u2019s monumental success, more and more people have awakened to the brilliance of K-dramas and movies. But whether you\u2019re new to embracing Hallyu (the Korean wave) or are a veteran, there are a lot of things that are bound to leave you confused while watching a K-drama. It is a globalised world we\u2019re living in currently, so things might seem pretty familiar on the surface, but common Korean customs might seem unique to a lot of us. Fret not, here\u2019s a little guide that might be a little helpful in navigating any K-drama or movie you want. You\u2019re welcome! Remnants of 500 years of Confucianism can still be observed in the respect accorded to elders and seniors in Korean society. Seniority can be based on age, position in the family, or job title. While this might not seem out of place for us, as this is also a facet of Indian culture, there are some customs that prove how ingrained this is in their daily lives. For instance, if you\u2019re out drinking with someone who is older than you, then it\u2019s customary to turn your head away from them while drinking. Also, when you receive something from an older or senior person, it\u2019s considered polite to use two hands while taking it. This goes for shaking their hands too. After-work hangs and team dinners are so important in Korean culture that they have a term for it: Hoesik. You\u2019re obligated to attend these drink or dinner outings that can include your co-workers, supervisors, and sometimes CEOs. It\u2019s considered as a way to increase the bond between co-workers. Hoesiks are used as essential plot device in many K-dramas, where it is used as a backdrop for whatever shenanigans the main leads have to pull. In real life, Hoesiks are considered tedious and problematic as the staff is still expected to uphold a strict code of conduct as this is considered an extension of the workplace. The #MeToo movement brought about significant change in corporate culture, with regards to Hoesik. Senior members of the company could no longer force the subordinates to attend these work dinners and drink excessively. Conscription, or compulsory enlistment of men in military services, still exists in Korea. By law, male citizens have to enlist for military services for at least two years, between the ages of 18-28. Korean celebrities, including actors and K-pop idols are not exempted from mandatory military services.The right to refuse enlistment didn\u2019t exist in South Korea until recently. It was in 2018 that the South Korean Constitutional Court legalised conscientious objection as a basis for avoiding conscription. In Korea, calling each other by their first names directly is considered disrespectful. Your title can depend on your job description or position in the family. It also depend on whether you\u2019re in a formal or an informal relationship with that person. For instance, if you\u2019re in a formal setting, then you add \u2018sshi\u2019 after the name of the person to indicate respect. Another way of doing this is to add \u2018nim\u2019 to the end of their names. If you\u2019re talking informally, say to a friend or your partner, you add \u2018aa\u2019 or \u2018ya\u2019 to the end of their name. In the workplace, Koreans address each other using their rank or job title in the company along with their names. One of the evergreen questions that continues to make rounds of millions of sub-Reddits, is why do characters in K-dramas not know how to hug or kiss? Once you start watching Korean TV shows, you\u2019ll notice the lack of affection onscreen. The sparsely distributed scenes demonstrating physical affection, or \u2018skinship\u2019 (as it\u2019s commonly referred to in Korea) are often awkward and stilted. Korean society is still conservative in a lot of ways, so couples in Korea don\u2019t indulge in PDA in real life as it\u2019s considered inappropriate. They use other ways to show their affection like wearing matching clothes or, sometimes, holding hands. While the pressure of cracking entrance exams to get into good universities is something we\u2019re all sadly familiar with, it takes a whole different form in South Korea. Once students enter the tenth grade, the race to get selected into the top three South Korean universities begins. The commonly accepted way is through cracking an entrance exam, or \u2018Suneung\u2019. Students are required to undergo intensive preparations before they sit for the exams as there\u2019s a popular belief that if you fail this exam, your entire life would be a failure. Rich and affluent people hire expensive tutors to help their children and give them an edge for cracking the exams. This was expertly parodied in Korea\u2019s highest rated TV show of all times Sky Castle, a brilliant satire on the parents and children\u2019s obsessive behaviour regarding higher education. No Korean TV character enters a household with their shoes on. They slip out of their regular shoes and wear special house slippers before entering the house. This is done to avoid bringing the dirt and disease-causing bacteria from the outside to the inside. Koreans are particular about cleanliness and this is just a result of that. Korean people might not care whether you\u2019re a Libra, or a Gemini-Cancer cusp Mercury retrograde child. What they do want to know, however, is your blood type. Many Koreans associate different blood types with distinct personality traits that determine compatibility, likability, and even health status. It\u2019s not news that Korean beauty has taken over the world\u2014the famous \u201810-step skincare routine\u2019 or the \u2018glass skin\u2019 trend are proof. But this also means that the beauty standards in Korean society are extremely high and rigid. Due to this, the country has the highest ratio of plastic surgeries in the world. It\u2019s very common in both male and female Koreans, including people who are not even celebrities. Outer beauty is so important that it\u2019s one of the deciding factors in job hiring processes. If you\u2019ve seen Her Private Life or Touch Your Heart, you\u2019ll know what we mean when we say that being a celebrity in South Korea is a curse and a blessing. The stars and icons have legions of fans following their every step and if the celebrity fails to live up to the standards set by their fans then they\u2019re either discarded or torn down. They\u2019re constantly under scrutiny by the press and the fans, and one misstep can cause their downfall. This is also the reason why many celebrities don\u2019t disclose their relationship status to the public. The toxic celebrity culture also stems from the management agencies that effectively own these stars. 7 Korean comedy movies that are perfect for your next movie night Decoding the rise of foreign language shows All the new movies and film festivals you can now access from home via Hotstar, Disney+, Prime Video and more By Hasina Jeelani By Prabal Sharma By Kejhal Kalra By Kejhal Kalra By Namrata Kedar By Emma Spedding By Emma Spedding See more stories Cond\u00e9 Nast India \u00a9 2023 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
