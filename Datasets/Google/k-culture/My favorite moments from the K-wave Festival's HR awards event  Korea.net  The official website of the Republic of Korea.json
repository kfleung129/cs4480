The event included year-end awards ceremonies for both Honorary Reporters and K-influencers and\u00a0celebratory performances. This was the first time for me to take part in\u00a0the event via webinar.  My excitement was building since the day before the event as I participated in the rehearsal with other Honorary Reporters. Despite the time differences, we all eagerly waited for the ceremony with our countries' flags, which we were requested to prepare.  The following are my\u00a0top six moments from the ceremony.  Opening\u00a0performance of\u00a0'Arirang'\u00a0medleyHonorary Reporter from Mexico and minyo\u00a0(folk music)\u00a0singer\u00a0Nancy Gonzalez has performed numerous times at Korea.net-sponsored events. She was\u00a0joined by Laure Maro, a pansori (solo lyrical opera)\u00a0singer from France, in\u00a0an exquisite gugak\u00a0(traditional music)\u00a0performance of an \"Arirang\" medley that highlighted\u00a0the traditional essence of Korea.

Video montage of this year's activities by\u00a0Honorary ReportersA video montage of the Honorary Reporters'\u00a0journey since this year's induction ceremony made me proud\u00a0to be part of this program.\u00a0It emphasized the tagline \"Gateway to Korea\" as Honorary Reporters, despite differences in\u00a0nationality and culture, serve as bridges connecting their countries to Korea.   Awards ceremony and\u00a0acceptance\u00a0speechesThe best eight Honorary Reporters and two special selections\u00a0from each language were invited to Korea to attend the festival\u00a0and receive their awards from\u00a0Kim Geun-ho, director-general of KOCIS' Overseas Culture Promotion\u00a0Bureau. The winners shared their experiences and joy and\u00a0it was motivating to hear\u00a0how hard they worked over the past year.  Contemporary dance showNext was a powerful and enigmatic dance performance by Choi Kyung-chul, who performed with the\u00a0K-Culture Caravan. His captivating piece shifted\u00a0smoothly between fast and slow movements.\n\nRaffle drawing Before the end of\u00a0the first session, a raffle drawing was conducted for in-person visitors and those taking part in the\u00a0webinar. Fifteen\u00a0offline and five webinar participants were chosen to get\u00a0surprise gifts.\nAfter a very quick\u00a0hour,\u00a0another wonderful experience had been etched\u00a0into my memory. I am\u00a0grateful to KOCIS for providing such grand\u00a0ceremonies and encouraging Honorary Reporters\u00a0to do better.  kalhong617@korea.kr\n\n*This article is written by a Korea.net Honorary Reporter.
