Spanning popular culture such as pop music, TV dramas and films, Hallyu (Korean Wave) is expanding its influence in sectors like literature and performing arts. Korean food is no exception. From dishes served at Buddhist temples to kimchi, bulgogi (marinated grilled beef) and bibimbap (bowl of rice mixed with meat and assorted vegetables), Korean cuisine is loved by people around the world.\n\r\nDespite the global fervor for many aspects of Korean culture, alcohol is relatively lacking in recognition. Booze is a must in a setting with good music, dance and food. So why is Korean alcohol relatively unknown to most outside of Korea?\n\r\nThe Korea.net series \"Hidden charms of Korea \u2013 Sool\" explores the nation's alcoholic beverages and culture and the stories behind them.\nSoju, which is widely known as coming in a green bottle as shown in numerous Korean films and TV series, and makgeolli (milky rice wine) comprise a small sample of the wide diversity of Korean alcohol. In the past, Koreans made alcohol in creative ways with ingredients depending on the weather and region. This series is thus an extensive look at the largely unknown appeal of Korean alcohol to be shared with the world.
