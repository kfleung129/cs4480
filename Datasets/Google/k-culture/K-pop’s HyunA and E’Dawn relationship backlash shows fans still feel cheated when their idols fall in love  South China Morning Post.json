    "text": "Some fans of HyunA and E\u2019Dawn feel like they\u2019ve been betrayed after the K-pop idols\u2019 relationship was made public. Experts say while fans are more forgiving nowadays, some still feel like they have been lied to Singer Lee Yong rose to stardom in 1981 after his debut song Wind achieved phenomenal success. His popularity, however, was short-lived. Lee had lied about his marital status and was found to have a wife. He disappeared from the public eye abruptly as angry fans boycotted the singer and his performances. Despite this, K-pop singer HyunA and boyfriend E\u2019Dawn of K-pop group Pentagon are now facing a backlash from fans after their romantic relationship was made public. South Korean music fans have changed a lot since the Lee scandal in the 1980s. They no longer see their idols as their own possessions and have become more tolerant of stars\u2019 romantic relationships with other celebrities or ordinary people. Not only was E\u2019Dawn excluded from a Pentagon fan club event on August 11, Triple H \u2013 a group consisting of E\u2019Dawn, HyunA and Hui, another member of Pentagon \u2013 have cut short promotion of the new song Retro Future. Some fans are demanding that E\u2019Dawn leave Pentagon, saying he cheated on them and the group for two years while dating HyunA. \u201cE\u2019Dawn has been deluding his members and fans,\u201d Pentagon fan @daengiegu wrote on Twitter. \u201cBased on his words and actions, intended to show love for his girlfriend, we [fans] no longer want E\u2019Dawn to be involved with \u2026 Pentagon.\u201d On the other hand, another Pentagon fan @itzjstdazzle from Nigeria wrote: \u201cThe fact Korean fans say it\u2019s their culture, a culture of not allowing a grown man to date because he is an idol, is not something they should be proud of.\u201d Regarding the backlash among some Korean fans, culture critic Ha Jae-keun says that while some have been disappointed, it didn\u2019t mean they object to their idols dating like ordinary people. But he noted fans want their idols to control their emotions, at least in the public eye. \u201cRegarding E\u2019Dawn, fans may feel betrayed because they thought he was distracted by his celebrity girlfriend and he isn\u2019t solely devoted to his role as a musician and entertainer. This sense of betrayal is behind some fans\u2019 boycott of his CDs, concert tickets and other related goods,\u201d Ha says. He added that HyunA may suffer less damage to her career because the veteran idol has a more mature reputation and solidified fan base. \u201cIn the early 1990s, if there were rumours of dating, female stars were attacked viciously by fans, with\u2015some even receiving death threats. Compared to then, the situation has become much better,\u201d he says. Some say HyunA and E\u2019Dawn drew the ire of fans partly because they initially denied reports that they were together, but later reversed position and admitted they had been together for two years. Another critic, Park Ji-jong, says a singer\u2019s public image plays an important role in whether their fans support their relationships. \u201cIt\u2019s true that a majority of fans feel betrayed when they hear news about their favourite idols dating. But more and more fans are seeing it as a private issue for their idols and simply cheer them on,\u201d Park says. Park also points out that as the entertainment industry transformed along with the liberating force of social media, idols have started to express themselves more openly and communicate with their fans directly. \u201cHyunA and E\u2019Dawn admitting their relationship to local media and posting a message on Instagram instead of communicating through their agency is noteworthy in understanding the shifting power game between agencies and artists,\u201d he says.
