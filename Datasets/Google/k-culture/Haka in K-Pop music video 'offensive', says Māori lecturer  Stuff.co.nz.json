    "text": "A new K-Pop music video which opens with a traditional haka\u00a0is offensive, says a respected M\u0101ori\u00a0lecturer and filmmaker. Korean pop group NCT 127's new single Simon Says samples three seconds of a haka at the beginning of a song that ends with the defiant line \"we don't pay no attention\". It is another case of M\u0101ori culture being misappropriated, says Karlite Rangihau, a lecturer in the Masters of Indigenous Knowledge course at Te\u00a0W\u0101nanga\u00a0o Aotearoa\u00a0and a leading filmmaker. \"The haka is upbeat and represents masculinity but\u00a0I would never use a Korean tradition in any of my work,\" says Rangihau. \"If they came to New Zealand, or if they had a M\u0101ori\u00a0in that video doing the haka, then I think it'd\u00a0be fabulous.\" READ MORE: *\u00a0Ngai Tahu's reach shapes a new city *\u00a0Tyson ink stink resolved *\u00a0Tapu taboos *\u00a0Pounamu mana\u200b *\u00a0JK Rowling under fire for writing about 'Native American wizards' NCT 127 is a popular 10-member group formed in 2016. Simon Says is the lead single on their album Regulate. Rangihau\u00a0says she can appreciate how the haka's use in their video might seem okay. \"I'm from T\u016bhoe and if I view that music\u00a0video with that lens, then I'm offended. But if I wore my Te Arawa hat, I'll be\u00a0more understanding because Te Arawa have been engaged in tourism and international cultural events for a very long time.\" The K-Pop video is one of a long list of acts and media adopting M\u0101ori culture into their work. In the past the haka and moko have been used to sell products including energy drinks and German cars. Members of the Patea M\u0101ori\u00a0Club said they were disgusted when their song Poi E was used\u00a0during the BET awards show in June. In a live performance,\u00a0actress\u00a0Teyana\u00a0Taylor danced provocatively to\u00a0Poi E\u00a0as a promotion for the US television series\u00a0Hit The Floor\u00a0in which she stars. Rangihau says technology means that M\u0101ori\u00a0cannot\u00a0prevent their culture from being exposed and made accessible\u00a0to the world. \"We've reached a point in our cultural evolution that cannot be\u00a0defined or restricted to our marae.\" She says this is a lesson for all New Zealanders, not just M\u0101ori, to embrace and reclaim the indigenous culture of New Zealand. First step, she says, is for everyone to learn te reo M\u0101ori. \"We need to own it, \u00a0We need to repatriate our own history and culture because if we don't,\u00a0others\u00a0will and they'll misuse it.\" *Comments on this article have now closed. \u00a9 2023 Stuff Limited ",
