Scott Ren\u00e9 Magritte was a pop-culture meme years before there was an Internet. In 1951, when CBS aired a new logo\u2014a stylized eye hovering in a cloud-clotted sky\u2014it bore an uncanny resemblance to his painting \u201cThe False Mirror\u201d (1928). (The sky was later removed by the network.) Over the years, Magritte\u2019s art has been hijacked for designs ranging from the Beatles\u2019 record label to a Volkswagen ad to a bowler-hat light fixture. The Belgian Surrealist, who died in 1967, at age sixty-eight, is still going viral: in April, an anonymous artist started a Tumblr called Super Magritte, reimagining the artist\u2019s works as 8-bit designs by Nintendo. In one case, the locomotive that floats indelibly in the fireplace of the painting \u201cTime Transfixed\u201d (1938) is replaced by Super Mario\u2019s slow-moving bullet. Magritte\u2019s enduring popularity has edged his once shocking imagery into the realm of clich\u00e9. But his radical use of language and his transposition of the banal and the unnerving set a precedent. Would the enigmas of Jasper Johns\u2019s flags or Ed Ruscha\u2019s deadpan pairing of image and text have been conceivable otherwise? Magritte, who dressed like a banker and was known to paint at his dining-room table, saw himself as a \u201csecret agent\u201d in the war on bourgeois values. He once said of his mission, \u201cToo often by a twist of thought, we tend to reduce what is strange to what is familiar. I intend to restore the familiar to the strange.\u2019\u2019 New Yorkers can recapture that strangeness in \u201cMagritte: The Mystery of the Ordinary, 1926-1938,\u201d at MOMA (co-organized with the Art Institute of Chicago and the Menil Collection). The exhibition focusses on a dozen watershed years, starting with works that Magritte made for his first solo show, in Brussels\u2014the reviews were not great, but they established him as Belgium\u2019s only Surrealist and prompted him to move to the outskirts of Paris. There, he had a furiously productive three years (he made more than a hundred works in 1928 alone), but returned home in 1930, after the stock-market crash. The show ends in 1938, the year Magritte said, in a now famous lecture, \u201cSurrealism claims for our waking life a freedom similar to that which we have in our dreams.\u201d \u201cThe False Mirror\u201d and \u201cTime Transfixed\u201d are among the more than eighty works here, as is \u201cThe Treachery of Images\u201d (1929), which pairs the likeness of a pipe with the words \u201c Ceci n\u2019est pas une pipe.\u201d It may be art\u2019s most famous one-liner, but it\u2019s a startlingly modernist proposition: this isn\u2019t a pipe, it\u2019s a picture. After viewing the show, consider ducking into the museum\u2019s store, where a Magrittean item, designed by Tibor Kalman, has been a best-seller for years. It\u2019s a nondescript black umbrella, until you open it\u2014and a cloudy blue sky is revealed. (\u201cMagritte: The Mystery of the Ordinary, 1926-1938\u201d opens at MOMA on Sept. 28 and runs through Jan. 12.)\u00a0\u2666 By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.
