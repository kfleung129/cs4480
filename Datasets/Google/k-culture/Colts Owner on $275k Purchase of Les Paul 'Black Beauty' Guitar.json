    "text": "By \n\n\tJason Newman  For Jim Irsay,  the owner and CEO of the Indianapolis Colts and an avid collector of the world\u2019s most sought-after guitars, it was a steal at $275,000. At Arader Galleries, a New York City gallery and auction house more accustomed to selling antique maps and rare books, two rare guitars encased in glass were the centerpieces of a controversial and historical auction featuring the items of guitar pioneer, producer and songwriter Les Paul. On the left: a 1956 Gretsch Chet Atkins rare prototype. On the right: a 1954 black Custom guitar, dubbed Black Beauty, that became the prototype for guitars used by Paul McCartney, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton and Keith Richards, among many others. Chris McKinney, a product trainer for Gibson Guitars and Irsay\u2019s longtime curator, was one of 25 people in the room Thursday night. He arrived that morning from Indianapolis on a mission from Irsay: Buy Black Beauty.  After five minutes of bidding, McKinney bested an anonymous phone bidder, paying $275,000 ($335,000 including buyer\u2019s premium) on behalf of Irsay to add the instrument\u00a0to the sports owner\u2019s collection of 175 guitars. It was far from the most Irsay has paid for a guitar. In 2002, Irsay bought Jerry Garcia\u2019s Tiger, the Grateful Dead member\u2019s main guitar from 1979 to 1989, for $850,000. A decade later, in 2013, Irsay would add Bob Dylan\u2019s Sunburst Fender Stratocaster (in)famously used at Newport Folk Festival \u2014\u00a0the famed \u201cDylan goes electric\u201d guitar\u00a0\u2014\u00a0for $965,000. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to go north of $1 million, but I think we got it for a great price. I think it could\u2019ve gone for a lot more.\u201d The auction was not without its controversy. After Guitar Player magazine featured the instrument on its cover\u00a0with the eye-catching cover line \u201cThe Grail! The genesis of all Les Paul guitars to come!,\u201d many guitar experts and aficionados, including Cheap Trick\u2019s Rick Nielsen and blues guitarist Joe Bonamassa, said the pedigree of the instrument, while important, was overhyped. Critics noted that the first Les Pauls were released in 1952, two years before Black Beauty. \u201cDeceiving,\u201d Nielsen told the Washington Post\u00a0of the \u201choly grail\u201d claim. \u201cIt\u2019s just wrong.\u201d Editor\u2019s picks\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe 50 Worst Decisions in Movie History\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Biggest, Messiest Band Breakups in Music History\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe 500 Greatest Songs of All Time Irsay was unconcerned. \u201cIt\u2019s an important guitar,\u201d he\u00a0tells Rolling Stone after the auction. \u201cI don\u2019t feel it\u2019s the Holy Grail \u2014\u00a0that\u2019s a mythical term \u2014\u00a0but it has huge significance in that it was Paul\u2019s personal guitar and it was a huge influence in terms of producing electric guitars. I wasn\u2019t going to go north of $1 million, but I think we got it for a great price. I think it could\u2019ve gone for a lot more. This is a guitar builder\u2019s guitar.\u201d  Perhaps due to the criticism, Guernsey\u2019s, the auction house that organized the sale, fell short of President Arlan Ettinger\u2019s initial $2 million sales estimate for the instrument. \u201cPeople are going to try to hype things up,\u201d Irsay says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it all the time at auctions. I think the bidding was diminished because there was some of that negative talk from some very serious people that are respected. But I\u2019m really happy we got it.\u201d  Colts Owner on $275k Purchase of Les Paul \u2018Black Beauty\u2019 Guitar, Page 1 of 2 We want to hear it. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.
