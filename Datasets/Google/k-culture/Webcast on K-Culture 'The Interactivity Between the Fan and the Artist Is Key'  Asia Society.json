And while the commodification of culture isn't something new per se, the K-Pop industry may be the pinnacle of a centuries long development. Being\u00a0in an\u00a0industry that heavily relies on foreign markets, K-Pop production companies have been very active in finding new ways to reach their audience. In September, leading key players and experts talked about what made K-Pop pop out during these hard times. Our Key Takeaways K-Pop's paradigm shift\u00a0can be mainly attributed to the industry\u2019s reaction to the ongoing pandemic.\u00a0K-Pop production companies like SM Entertainment Group \u2013 one of the five top K-Pop giants \u2013 pioneered the online concert. These concerts\u00a0feature impressively innovative technology that allow fans to experience the concerts from the comfort of their home.\u00a0This includes the use of augmented reality (AR) visuals, where backdrops, graphics, lyrics and even entire digital characters may be superimposed onto or combined with live stage footage. Live video chat allows for direct interaction with fans. Bluetooth-paired light sticks\u00a0sync\u00a0over the Internet with AR visuals whose movement can be seen by concert viewers \u2013 just as though they\u2019re there. Among South Korea\u2019s major exports, K-Pop was ranked 13th in 2018, outgrowing home appliances \u2013 formerly a cornerstone of Korea\u2019s post-war export economy. A contributing factor to K-Pop\u2019s monetary success was the companies\u2019 diversification in terms of monetization and their foray into global markets. K-Pop as it is now is a highly streamlined and structured industry involving several layers of producers, directors and other actors \u2013 down to all the casting, training, production and marketing agencies \u2013, which by experts is considered to be another pillar of its success. Timely reactions to cultural and market changes is seen as the key to growth. This is also what drives the unique way the industry manages media crossovers rarely seen in other markets. Finally, products may be localized and adapted to individual markets. In this context, online concerts are seen as one way to continue this steady pace of innovation. Beneath the entire business system, industry leaders are aware that fandom is what supports this continuing K-Pop wave and are therefore very eager to keep the fire lit through interactivity and the aforementioned media crossovers. They are confident that they have figured out the recipe for success, or that they will do so when the time comes for another round of innovation.
