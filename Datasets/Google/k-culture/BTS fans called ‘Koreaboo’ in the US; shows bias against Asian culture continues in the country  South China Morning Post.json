    "text": "By Dong Sun-hwa K-pop sensations BTS may have broken into the massive US music market, but the seven-piece boy band and their followers are still battling prejudice and discrimination against Asia and its pop culture. Trolls still taunt BTS online over what they argue are signs of the members\u2019 lack of masculinity \u2013 wearing make-up, dying their hair rainbow colours and having fancy outfits. They also accuse them of being puppets manufactured by K-pop companies with no musical skills. And the BTS Army fan club also regularly comes under fire for supporting the boy band. The \u201cKoreaboo\u201d phenomenon in the US is an indication of this prejudice and discrimination, according to researchers at Sogang University in Seoul. Although Koreaboo is a derogatory term referring to people too obsessed with Korean culture, it is now widely used in the US to describe K-pop fans. \u201cK-pop fans attempt to distinguish themselves from the Koreaboos out of self-defence,\u201d researcher Marisa Lilette Luckie said during the \u201cK-pop beyond BTS: Media technology, creative industries and fandom culture\u201d seminar at Yonsei University, Seoul, last week. Luckie and her co-researchers \u2013 Won Yong-jin, Pang Hui-kyong and Lee Jun-hyung \u2013 said the lumping together of Koreaboos and regular fans was a sign that K-pop had not been fully embraced in the US. \u201cTo prove they are \u2018normal\u2019 followers who respect Korean culture, they criticise the Koreaboos \u2026 This shows there is still a bias against Asian culture in America.\u201d Seventeen researchers from around the globe gave lectures on BTS and South Korean culture during the seminar. They said BTS had been changing the perception that \u201cAsians are unattractive\u201d, but discrimination had not been completely rooted out. \u201cThe phenomenon also shows that today, discrimination against Asia and its people has become more indirect,\u201d Luckie said. \u201cPeople now discriminate against those who follow Asian culture as well. \u201cThe discrimination has become ethnic too. As the culture of ethnic minorities in the US gains popularity, Americans \u2026 have displayed signs of more \u2018specific\u2019 ethnic discrimination.\u201d The seminar was organised by the Korea Society for Journalism and Communication Studies and sponsored by BTS\u2019 agency Big Hit Entertainment. It was held to discuss various cultural phenomena surrounding the Billboard-chart-topping BTS. ",
