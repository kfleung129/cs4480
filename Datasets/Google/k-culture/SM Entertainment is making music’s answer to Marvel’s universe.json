So when he does speak publicly, it\u2019s worth listening very closely to find out what makes the wheels turn at the K-pop giant he\u2019s in charge of, whose roster features stars like EXO, Girls Generation and Shinee. Lee appeared as a keynote speaker at 2021 STARTUP:CON last week and shared some insight into SM\u2019s vision for the future of K-pop. He also announced SM\u2019s ambitious goal of wanting to make Seoul, already the birthplace of K-Pop and K-culture, \u201cthe mecca of global culture.\u201d The executive, who joined SM Entertainment in 2005 as part of the A&R team, argued in his speech that K-pop is \u201cnot just a genre of music, but a genre of content\u201d. At the centre of SM\u2019s content strategy is the SM Culture Universe (SMCU), which, Lee explained, is a \u201cfuture entertainment universe that connects the world through culture without any boundaries between reality and virtual reality\u201d. SMCU is essentially a character-led universe akin to cinematic universes like those created by comic giants Marvel or D.C. Explaining the concept around SMCU at the company\u2019s \u2018SM Congress 2021\u2019 back in June, Sung Su Lee said that it \u201ccan be thought of as SM\u2019s metaverse, inviting K-pop fans around the world to appreciate our music and stories via various platforms\u201d. He added in his speech last week that SMCU \u201cwill not only include our original content, but also [content] recreated by the fans\u201d. This is achieved specifically through the company\u2019s \u2018Pink Blood Project\u2019, a fan engagement platform that supports what it calls \u2018prosumers\u2019 \u2013 SM fans who create their own content inspired by SM\u2019s acts. The origins of the SMCU, Sung Su Lee told the audience last week, are rooted in SM founder and Executive Producer Soo-Man Lee\u2019s prediction of \u201cthe future becoming a world of robots and celebrities, as well as avatars\u201d. As such, said Sung Su Lee, SM Entertainment has \u201cbeen preparing for the future [i.e. virtual] content era for decades\u201d. The company\u2019s big expansion into the rising virtual artist space, and its introduction of SMCU concept, arrived in October last year with the launch of aespa \u2013 a \u2018Metaverse Girl Group\u2019 featuring four human members and four virtual counterparts. According to Sung Su Lee, SMCU is a \u201cmassive virtual world that starts with aespa\u2019s storytelling\u201d. The name \u201caespa\u201d is a combination of \u2018ae\u2019 (initials for \u2018avatar\u2019 and \u2018experience\u2019) and \u2018aspect\u2019, which, SM says, represents \u201cthe meeting of another self and experiencing a new world\u201d. The group\u2019s debut single Black Mamba, released in November 2020, surpassed 21 million views within its first 24 hours. And in May this year, SM released Episode 1 of aespa\u2019s big-budget cinematic comic-esque film, also called Black Mamba (see below). Sung Su Lee explained that \u201cthe main keyword\u201d of the company\u2019s universe is \u2018KWANGYA\u2019, which he says \u201cholds a symbolic meaning as it encompasses both real and virtual worlds\u201d. \u201cK-Pop fans call our relocated SM Headquarters in Seongsu-Dong and the Seoul Forest area KWANGYA,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s our goal for \u2018KWANGYA,\u2019 an infinite virtual universe, to expand as the concept of space that refers to our new location and become the landmark of SMCU.\u201d Sung Su Lee\u2019s latest speech arrived several weeks after it was reported that 20% of SM Entertainment is up for sale, including over 18% of the shares owned by founder and executive producer Lee Soo Man. Quoting \u2018investment banking insiders\u2019, Korean news site AllKpop reports that it\u2019s likely that either Kakao Entertainment or CJ Entertainment \u2013 the production company behind Korean blockbuster movie Parasite \u2013\u00a0will swoop for the stake in the music company. Citing sources again, AllKpop reports further that CJ is Lee Soo Man\u2019s preferred choice and is currently looking like the \u2018strongest buyer candidate\u2019. If CJ and SM, were to go into business together, it wouldn\u2019t mark the first time that SM has worked with a titan of the film world. Sung Su Lee noted in his speech that back in 2010, SM Entertainment and Canadian film maker James Cameron \u2013 who created box office smash Avatar \u2013\u00a0teamed up to create 3D content. \u201cDespite being a music-based culture content company for over 20 years, SM has always understood the importance of incorporating the latest technologies of time such as IT and AI into our content and have been implementing such (technologies) for over 20 years.\u201d Sung Su Lee, SM Entertainment \u201cIt was very ahead of time back then, but when producer James Cameron\u2019s Avatar swept the world with its 3D content, SM had already finished the related R&D, which allowed us to establish a consortium with Samsung Electronics and [Cameron] to showcase Girls\u2019 Generation\u2019s 3D music video right away,\u201d explained Sung Su Lee last week. He added: \u201cDespite being a music-based culture contents company for over 20 years, SM has always understood the importance of incorporating the latest technologies of time such as IT and AI into our contents and have been implementing such [technologies] for over 20 years. \u201cNow, in an era where IT, AI and contents cross boundaries and take place in companies and various contents, we, as a content company, would like to work with and support innovative, technology-based start-up companies.\u201d Elsewhere in his speech, Lee said that the SMCU was created \u201cthrough decades of accumulated killer content and IP expansion\u201d and, that it is this \u201cmetaverse-styled future content that SM strives for\u201d. As an example of IP expansion, Lee introduced the company\u2019s \u2018Remastering Project,\u2019 which aims to boost the quality of SM\u2019s original music videos as well as re-mastering the company\u2019s original tracks, which he says \u201care SM\u2019s precious assets and the history of K-Pop\u201d. \u201cWhen viewing the structure of K-POP from the perspective of a global trend called Metaverse in the post-COVID era, K-POP can be seen as a new form of cultural IP content never-before-seen in existing genres of music.\u201d Sung Su Lee Continued Lee: \u201cWhen viewing the structure of K-Pop from the perspective of a global trend called metaverse in the post-COVID era, K-Pop can be seen as a new form of cultural IP content never-before-seen in existing genres of music. \u201cThis is SMCU as based off the worldview we are creating, and we will reach the next level by creating an expanding universe of metaverse-styled IP content that connects the various and independent IPs of artists, music, music videos, performances, etc. within SMCU to one another.\u201dMusic Business Worldwide The best of MBW, plus the most important music biz stories on the web.
