The Korean Popular Culture & Arts Awards are government prizes that recognize the work of artists in various fields who have contributed to the development of popular culture. This year\u2019s ceremony was held on November 24 at the National Theater of Korea. The event was hosted by actor Park Sun Ho and former announcer Jang Ye Won with congratulatory performances given by Aiki and her dance crew Hook, Paul Kim, and Oh My Girl\u2019s YooA. Director Park Chan Wook and the late actress Kang Soo Yeon were awarded the evening\u2019s greatest honors with the Eungwan Order of Cultural Merit (Second Class). The late actress Kang Soo Yeon, who passed away in May, made her debut as a child actress at the young age of four. Kang Soo Yeon emerged as a world star following her role in director Im Kwon Taek\u2019s 1987 film \u201cThe Surrogate Woman.\u201d For this role, Kang Soo Yeon took home the Best Actress Award at the 1987 Venice International Film Festival, becoming the first Korean actor \u2013 male or female \u2013 to win an award at a major film festival. This same year, Kang Soo Yeon was awarded the Okgwan Order of Cultural Merit (4th Class) for her achievements. In a video message, director Im Kwon Taek shared, \u201cAn actor who can win awards at global film festivals has emerged. The status of Korean film has risen significantly. [Kang Soo Yeon] was the kind of actress who was incredibly confident, made her convictions clear, and clearly carried them out.\u201d Kang Soo Yeon\u2019s younger sister Kang Soo Kyung received the award in her place. She commented, \u201cWhile coming here, I was reminded of when my sister received the Okgwan Order of Cultural Merit in 1987. I\u2019ve thought a lot about what it would be like if she was here. This year, it\u2019s been 53 years since my sister\u2019s debut. I hope my sister remembers and is comforted by how many people recognize how diligently she lived while doing her best for a long period of time, and is resting well in a good place. I sincerely thank everyone who remembers actress Kang Soo Yeon.\u201d Earlier this year, director Park Chan Wook set a new record for the most awards received by a Korean filmmaker at the Cannes Film Festival after winning Best Director for his 2022 film \u201cDecision to Leave.\u201d As he is currently filming abroad, Park Chan Wook gave his acceptance speech in a video message. He shared, \u201cThere are a lot of times where my films do not portray our country and our citizens as very beautiful or respectful identities, so I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m allowed to receive an Order of Merit given by the country.\u201d He continued, \u201cHowever, I believe that it\u2019s an artist\u2019s duty to honestly view and depict humans and society. I will think of this as recognition of my efforts and in the future too, I will brush up my act and dig into this world and the human race with an even more thorough attitude.\u201d In total, five people received an Order of Cultural Merit, six received Presidential Commendations, eight received Prime Minister\u2019s commendations, and 10 artists/groups received\u00a0Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism\u2019s Commendations.
