    "text": "The South Korean government released a new strategy for deregulation in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry on Dec. 17. According to its plan, a large number of AI R&D and commercialization activities will be deregulated and an investment of approximately one trillion won will be made for advanced semiconductor development so that an economic effect of up to 455 trillion won can be created by 2030 in the industry. Negative regulatory systems will be established in the industry next year along with basic laws and ethical standards complying with international standards. In addition, AI industry complexes will be built in Gwangju City and many other regions in 2020 to 2024. The strategy includes investment plans for the global top spot in the AI semiconductor industry. Especially, a strategic investment will be made in power integrated modules (PIMs), which are AI chips imitating the human brain. An AI investment fund will be raised next year, too. Also, the government is going to allow colleges to open AI departments and their professors to work for companies. Every military member and every new public official will be required to have related education starting from next year. The same compulsory education will be applied to education majors so that AI education can be effectively provided at primary and secondary schools. When it comes to industrial AI utilization, 2,000 smart factories based on the technology will be built by 2030, sample data and evaluation systems will be prepared regarding clinical verification related to AI medical equipment, and AI-based new drug development platforms will be set up within two years. AI-based command support will be developed in the defense sector and AI-based public transport R&D projects for autonomous driving purposes will be launched in 2021. Never miss another article!
