    "text": "By Kang Seung-woo Seungri, a member of K-pop group BigBang, will voluntarily appear for police questioning over allegations against a nightclub he was associated with, including drug use and distribution, and solicitation of prostitution for foreign investors, his management agency said. \u201cApologising for a month-long series of issues linked to him, Seungri is set to voluntarily appear at a police agency [and] give his full cooperation, including a drug test, in its investigation into allegations involving him,\u201d YG Entertainment said in a statement. The management agency\u2019s legal team is arranging the date with police. The latest news increased speculation that Seungri may have been involved in drug use or distribution, given that the singer worked as the club\u2019s public relations director. Burning Sun is at the centre of a scandal involving drug trafficking, sexual assaults and violence against its customers. Club employees are accused of drugging female customers with date rape drug gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) to help male VIPs sexually assault them. Separately, the 28-year-old Seungri faces fresh allegations that he solicited prostitutes for foreign investors in his new business. According to a local media outlet, Seungri attempted to buy sexual services for foreign investors in an investment company that he was preparing to establish in December 2015. YG denied the claim and said the report was \u201cfabricated\u201d. ",
