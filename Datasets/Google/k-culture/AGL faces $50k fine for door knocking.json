AGL could face a fine of $50,000, after one of its door-to-door sales people ignored a Do Not Knock sign. The Federal Court in Melbourne found the energy retailer and its agent CPM Australia breached Australian consumer law by ignoring the sign. 'The message was an unambiguous request to leave the premises, without knocking.'Credit: Eddie Jim The breach occurred in 2011 when an uninvited salesman contracted by CPM knocked on the front door of a South Australian home to sell energy on behalf of AGL. Despite a Do Not Knock sign on the front door, he remained on the premises and knocked. Justice John Middleton found the message on the door was clear and sufficient to communicate a request to leave. \u2018\u2018The message was an unambiguous request to leave the premises, without knocking,\u2019\u2019 he said in his judgement today. Justice Middleton said the sign could constitute a request for the salesperson to leave. The salesman\u2019s actions breached section 75 of the Australian Consumer Law, which says a dealer who calls on a person to negotiate an unsolicited consumer agreement must leave immediately on their request. Justice Middleton said it did not matter if a consumer did not request the salesman to leave verbally. \u2018\u2018The whole idea of the Do Not Knock Sign was to avoid confronting a salesperson, and being caught in discussion. \u2018\u2018Consumers may be vulnerable, or too polite to tell people to leave. \u2018\u2018Putting an appropriate sign on the door may be the best, or only way, to communicate the request to leave the premises.\u2019\u2019 Consumer Action Law Centre chief executive Gerard Brody said the decision sends a clear message to door-to-door salespeople across the country. \u2018\u2018Australians have a right to enjoy their personal time without the unwanted distraction of salespeople,\u2019\u2019 he said. A further hearing to determine the penalty will be held at a date to be fixed. The ACCC said the court\u2019s decision confirms that consumers can use a sign to request uninvited salespeople to leave their premises and do not need to meet the salesperson face-to-face to ask them to leave. \u2018\u2018Businesses must respect people\u2019s wishes in their homes,\u2019\u2019 ACCC commissioner Sarah Court said in a statement. \u2018\u2018The ACCC will not hesitate to take action to protect consumers in their homes and enforce compliance with the laws.\u2019\u2019 The ACCC will now seek penalties for AGL and CPM\u2019s failure to leave the consumer\u2019s premises when requested. Comment is being sought from AGL and CPM. AAP Copyright \u00a9 2023 ",
