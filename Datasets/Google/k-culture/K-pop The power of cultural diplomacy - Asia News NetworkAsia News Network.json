K-pop and K-film have not only let the world know about South Korea, but also significantly upgraded its international image. Recently, I found out that the most highly rated Netflix movies included two Korean films, \u201cHandmaiden\u201d and \u201cMother.\u201d Then, I came across an intriguing article in The Guardian, entitled, \u201cSquid Game, Blackpink, kimchi pancakes \u2026 How did South Korea become such a world power?\u201d The article begins with the subheading \u201cOne minute everyone wants a bit of British and American culture, the next you\u2019re on the phone desperately trying to get tickets for the latest K-pop sensation.\u201d In that article, Zoe Williams wrote, \u201cMy kid, along with my niece, is a \u2018blink,\u2019 which means a fan of Blackpink, a girl band that US and UK media always call the most successful \u201cSouth Korean\u201d act of all time, omitting to mention that \u2014 as the most followed music act on YouTube \u2014 they really don\u2019t need the national qualifier.\u201d Then, she continues, \u201cThe second most followed act, incidentally, is BTS \u2014 AKA the Bangtan Boys, also South Korean.\u201d Then Williams further points out, \u201cLikewise, people often call Squid Game Netflix\u2019s most successful South Korean show of all time, when it is actually Netflix\u2019s most successful show, full stop.\u201d According to Williams, K-pop and K-drama have already transcended the limits of South Korea as a single nation and a particular culture and has now become a universal phenomenon. Thus, she argues that the adjective \u201cSouth Korean\u201d no longer fits the description of Korean pop culture. As Williams suggests in her article, the British and American people have assumed for a long time that they are the dominant culture that influences the world. It is true that in the past, British and American popular culture has fascinated foreigners who consequently wanted to learn English. The Beatles and Hollywood are good examples that have enchanted the international community. \u201cThen one day, wham.\u201d Williams wrote rather humorously: \u201cThe Anglosphere lost the worldwide popularity crown, and you didn\u2019t even notice until one of your kids wants 400 pounds to go to a concert, and another one knows how to make kimchi pancakes and the third is trailing the new opinion that K-pop is for \u2018neeks\u2019.\u201d The same phenomenon is happening in the US, too. Many of my American friends have confessed to me that their children are huge fans of K-pop, K-drama, and K-movies. My students at UC Irvine, too, were no exception. They enormously liked BTS and Korean films. I have found that many American students at Dartmouth are also big fans of \u201cParasite,\u201d \u201cSquid Game,\u201d \u201cMinari,\u201d \u201cAll of Us Are Dead,\u201d and \u201cKingdom.\u201d Some time ago, a friend of mine who teaches at Dartmouth told me that one of his female American students was very much interested in learning the Korean language because she liked K-pop so much. When she found that her professor, too, was a fan of K-pop, she was delighted and at the same time felt a strong rivalry. Obviously, the same thing goes for Japan, as well. A Japanese intellectual, Sasaki Yasuo recently wrote to me, \u201cMy granddaughter is visiting us for Xmas/ New Year holidays. She is in the Graduate School at Kyoto University and has many Korean acquaintances, and she looks like she has some knowledge of the Korean language.\u201d Then Sasaki continues, \u201cKorean K-pop music seems to have her glued to Korean culture, deciding that she has to learn the language for about a year. Now I understand why she used to go to Seoul so frequently with group of friends. For me, it is a good example of cultural diplomacy that both sides should learn. It is regrettable however to see our relations so deeply ruined to an irreparable magnitude.\u201d Today, South Korean films and TV shows have won so many prestigious international film awards such as the Academy Award and the Golden Globe Award, in addition to the film festival awards at Cannes, Venice and Berlin. BTS, too, has received so many music awards, such as artist of the year at the American Music Awards, MTV Video Music Awards and many others. It is true that K-pop singers and Korean film directors/actors have done a splendid job as cultural ambassadors. They have achieved what only a few Korean politicians have done in diplomacy. In fact, we could see that our pop culture stars\u2019 recent accomplishments greatly contributed to cultural diplomacy. Traditionally, the Korean people are very good at singing, dancing, and performing on stage. Now, their extraordinary abilities enjoy international fame and attention. It is encouraging to hear that \u201cSouth Korea has become a world power\u201d through K-pop and film. Now is the time for our politicians to wake up and show us what they can do to make South Korea a world power politically and diplomatically.
