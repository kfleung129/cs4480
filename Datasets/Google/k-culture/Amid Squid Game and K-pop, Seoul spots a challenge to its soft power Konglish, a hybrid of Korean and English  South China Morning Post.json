    "text": "Cho Mi-hak, 66, wanted to know how her son\u2019s job was going, so she stole a glimpse at his mobile phone and the text messages he had been exchanging with friends and colleagues. Her son needn\u2019t have worried about his privacy, however, as she could barely understand a word. \u201cGosh, I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around some of the messages as they were laden with strange words, ones that appeared to be combinations of shortened words or hybrids of English and Korean that were beyond my apprehension,\u201d she said. She later came to learn that Bepu meant \u201cbest friend\u201d, Ah-Ah meant \u201cIced Americano\u201d, Inssa was \u201cinsider\u201d and Assa was \u201coutsider\u201d. In short, her son\u2019s messages were littered with Konglish \u2013 hybridised words that mix Korean and English and are popular with the younger generation but largely incomprehensible to their elders. For the older generation, such words represent the butchering of a language that instils so much national pride that the anniversary of its alphabet\u2019s creation is marked with a national holiday every October 9. At a ceremony on Saturday, to celebrate Hangul\u2019s 575th birthday, Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum said the government would lead the way in addressing the \u201ccorruption\u201d of the Korean language. \u201cBut for Hangul, it would have been impossible for the country to rise to the ranks of the world\u2019s top 10 economies and to grow as a digital powerhouse. It was also thanks to Hangul that K-pop and K-culture have become objects of love for people across the world,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThe government will continue efforts to reduce the use of foreign words and jargon and to convert them into easy Korean words,\u201d the prime minister added. While the prime minister referred to Hangul as a \u201cglobal language\u201d, critics pointed out that technically the Korean language is known as Hanguk-eo, or Woorimal, while Hangul is a system of alphabets \u2013 though many Koreans colloquially use Hangul to refer to both the language and its alphabet. Nam Mi-jeong, a linguist at the national Korean language institute said because the alphabet and the language were so interlinked, and so many Koreans used Hangul to mean the language anyway, that there was little point drawing a distinction between the two. The rise of K-pop and K-dramas, not to mention recent Netflix hits such as  Squid Game , have fuelled international interest in South Korean pop culture so much that the Oxford English Dictionary this year included 26 new Korean terms, including Hallyu (\u201cthe Korean wave\u201d); mukbang, (a live-streamed video featuring a person eating a large quantity of food while talking to the audience); chimaek (the pairing of chicken and beer) and bulgogi (marinated and grilled shreds of beef or pork). Indeed, the dictionary has even added the term Konglish. But while the gatekeeper of the English language appears open to using foreign words, the feeling in South Korea \u2013 particularly among the older generation \u2013 is far from mutual. Many are fiercely proud of the Altaic language, which usually places objects before verbs and is widely praised by linguists for its scientific accuracy and convenience in the information technology age. Against the precision of Korean, Konglish just doesn\u2019t cut it, they say. \u201cMany young people simply ignore rules for spelling and forge new jargon and slang on a whim,\u201d complained No Bo-kyun, 69. \u201cUnder these circumstances, what\u2019s the point of celebrating Hangul Day as a national holiday?\u201d Still, the country has a long way to go if it is to rid its legal and administrative documents and news media of words and hybrids loaned from other languages. Many of the English hybrids reflect the strong US military presence (the country hosts 28,500 American troops), while other words stem from Japanese, a legacy of the 1910-1945 period of Japanese colonial rule. One popular word in the local news media of late is widcorona, an approximation of \u201cwith corona\u201d that reflects the lack of a \u201cth\u201d sound in Korean. This refers to the country\u2019s plan to learn to live with the virus and return to normal in mid-November, when more than 80 per cent of the population are expected to have been vaccinated. Meanwhile, most shopping streets and department stores are decorated with signs written in English or French words, many of them misspelled, while instructions on vending machines are also often in English. 02:16 Squid Game drives boom in Korean lessons Kim Seoncheol, a senior official at the National Institute of Korean Language, said the phenomenon was being fuelled by young people on social media. \u201cThey think it\u2019s more fun and cool but it\u2019s regrettable that they use absurd or incorrect English-based words instead of pure and beautiful Korean words\u201d, he said, giving the example of young people using the English word \u201ctension\u201d when they really meant \u201cjoy\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to force businesses to use the Korean language but I just hope Korean people may discard their reckless use of foreign words and realise what treasures they have been bequeathed from their ancestors in the form of a beautiful language and perfect alphabets,\u201d he said. And it\u2019s not just the older generation struggling with the constantly evolving memes and vocab. \u201cI\u2019m in my mid-20s but even I sometimes can\u2019t follow what is being spoken by teenagers,\u201d said Hyun Ye-rim, 24. She gave as an example the word Banmo, a combination of the Korean word banmal \u2013 that means words without honorific endings \u2013 and the English word \u201cmode\u201d, to describe the practice of speaking informally. Still, she said the older generation shouldn\u2019t worry too much. \u201cI think we can just leave the young ones speaking the way they like because they do this to share a sense of comradeship among themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cThey will eventually outgrow such words, as I quickly did.\u201d 03:04 Win a jackpot or die: Netflix\u2019s South Korean thriller \u2018Squid Game\u2019 becomes latest global sensation ",
