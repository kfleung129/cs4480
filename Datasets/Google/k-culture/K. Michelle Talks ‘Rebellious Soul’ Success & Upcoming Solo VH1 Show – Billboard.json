Michelle parted ways with RCA in 2011 after initially signing with Jive Records in 2008. \u201cI wanted to get out of my label contract because of things that I couldn\u2019t control that happened to me. I did not get dropped. They didn\u2019t understand me, and a part of me thinks that I didn\u2019t understand myself,\u201d K. Michelle says. During the season-one taping of VH1\u2019s \u201cLove & Hip-Hop: Atlanta,\u201d the singer/songwriter revealed that she was abused by ex-manager and former Jive music executive Mickey \u201cMemphitz\u201d Wright while at the label.

Michelle continued to garner buzz, releasing five mixtapes between 2010 and 2013. She looked to MBK Entertainment\u2019s Jeff Robinson to manage her, who admits to being hesitant at first due to her former label struggles. \u201cK. Michelle asked me for a while to manage and I kept saying, \u2018Nope.\u2019 But we struck up a great friendship,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cA lot of people felt like she came with baggage, but I believe in forming my own opinions about people. Once I fell in love with her sincerity, the naysayers brushed off my shoulders.\u201d The singer joined the cast of \u201cLove & Hip-Hop: Atlanta\u201d in 2012. \u201cThe only reason I did [the show] was to get a record deal, which I got after the first season [with Warner Music Group], and promote my music,\u201d she says.

That\u2019s why I got off,\u201d she says. \u201cBeing that I\u2019m going to stick to reality, the terms have to be right for me.
