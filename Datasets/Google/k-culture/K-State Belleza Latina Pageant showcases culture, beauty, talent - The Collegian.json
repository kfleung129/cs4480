    "text": "Ladies in evening gowns showcased their beauty and talents to Latin rhythms in Forum Hall on Saturday for the Hispanic American Leadership Organization\u2019s fifth annual K-State Belleza Latina Pageant. This year\u2019s theme was \u201cAztec Beauty,\u201d and the event started with a group dance by all six competitors wearing traditional Penahos headdresses and Aztec-inspired costumes designed by the contestants themselves. \u201cBecause the majority of the ladies competing are of Mexican descent, we wanted to make it something that embraces our culture and our ancestors,\u201d Viviana Ortiz, event coordinator and junior in animal sciences and industry, said. According to Gilbert Davila, assistant principal at Junction City Middle School, the competition began in the morning with an interview portion, where contestants were asked questions about their cultural background, career ambitions and why they wanted to participate in the pageant. The second half of the event reconvened in the afternoon, where the participants competed in swimsuit, talent and evening-wear events in front of an audience of 40 attendees, Denise Torres, president of the HALO, said. Talents ranged from dancing to playing the violin. Alejandra Gonzalez, junior in Spanish, performed a spoken-word poem, in both English and Spanish, about what she said she perceives as discrimination against Hispanics in America today. \u201cI love both of my nations, both of my cultures, both of my countries,\u201d Gonzalez said in her poem. \u201cI love tamales as much as I love apple pie.\u201d Davila, a veteran judge at the competition, said he was asked three years ago to be a part of the pageant when he was an assistant professor with the Staley School of Leadership Studies. \u201cIt\u2019s enjoyable because you get to see all the wonderful talent and really intelligent young ladies,\u201d Davila said. \u201cWhen we interview them, you can see what they\u2019re all about, what they\u2019re working toward and the pride they take in their culture.\u201d According to Torres, HALO was the organization sponsoring the pageant and all the money raised at the event goes to awarding the top winners with scholarships. First place receives a prize of $500 and the runner up wins $250, Torres said. \u201cWe try to help them financially because we all know the struggle,\u201d Torres said. First-place winner and Miss Congeniality were awarded to Gonzalez. \u201cI\u2019m honestly a little bit shocked,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t too nervous and I guess everything happens for a reason.\u201d First runner-Up, People\u2019s Choice Award and Miss Photogenic, were awarded to Jessica Martinez, junior in social work. \u201cIt feels awesome,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cI\u2019m glad Alejandra got to win; she\u2019s a great contestant. I really wanted that crown, but I\u2019m glad to be first runner-up. I will definitely try again next year.\u201d According to Torres, all six contestants at the pageant are members of HALO but it is open to any Hispanic female students interested in competing. The pageant was formed five years ago with the purpose of bringing Hispanic women together to showcase their talents and build their confidence, Torres said. \u201cAll the girls say that even though they don\u2019t win, they definitely gain that sense of empowerment and it\u2019s definitely a confidence-booster,\u201d Torres said. According to Torres, HALO serves as a liaison between the Office of Diversity and other multicultural organizations and helps promote Hispanic cultural awareness. \u201cIt\u2019s a home away from home for Hispanics across the campus,\u201d Torres said.
