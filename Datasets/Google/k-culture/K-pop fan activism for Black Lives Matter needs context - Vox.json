K-pop fans gained new attention this weekend, after they claimed to have registered thousands of tickets for President Trump\u2019s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with the intention of not showing up. To the president\u2019s dismay, the arena ended up appearing more than half empty during the rally, leading some K-pop fans to declare victory \u2014 although it\u2019s not clear how much of that was due to the fans\u2019 actions. The stunt was viewed by many as a demonstration of allyship with Black Lives Matter-supporting protesters and Juneteenth celebrants. It followed Korean pop music fans\u2019 sabotage earlier this month of a surveillance app used by the Dallas Police Department \u2014 an app that the police encouraged locals to use to send tips about illegal activity among protesters. K-pop fans also recently participated in the derailment of a \u201cWhite Lives Matter\u201d hashtag, which they flooded with pictures and videos of their favorite idols. And although these actions have been celebrated by many on the left, including by politicians and protesters themselves, some music fans think it\u2019s important to also remember that K-pop \u2014 including its fandom \u2014 has a history of cultural misappropriation and racism. In recent years, Korean pop idols have been called out for perpetuating stereotypes about black Americans and for misappropriating black culture by wearing, for example, cornrows and dreadlocks. Artists have also received some backlash for stating that they are skilled at \u201ctalking Black\u201d and for racist acts like wearing blackface. \u201cIt sounds sort of racist because it often is racist,\u201d Miranda Ruth Larsen, a K-pop fan and  cultural studies researcher at the University of Tokyo, whose work focuses on male Korean and Japanese idols and groups, said during an interview for the Vox podcast Reset. That said, the cultural misappropriation (a term Larsen prefers to \u201ccultural appropriation,\u201d which she says typically refers to a more conscious process) within K-pop shouldn\u2019t be blamed solely on the artists. \u201cSo let\u2019s say that a K-pop artist is wearing a controversial hairstyle \u2014 like they\u2019re wearing dreads or they\u2019re wearing cornrows \u2014 eight times out of 10, they did not pick that hairstyle,\u201d Larsen said. \u201cThe decision for their hairstyle came from a company, came to a manager, came through an entire chain of command that is responsible and culpable for this bad decision.\u201d For Larsen, making sure fans and journalists understand this history and way the industry functions is crucial. Without it, it\u2019s impossible to get a full picture of what these recent online activism campaigns coming from K-pop fandoms represent. Listen to the episode of Reset below.

Most news outlets make their money through advertising or subscriptions. But when it comes to what we\u2019re trying to do at Vox, there are a couple reasons that we can't rely only on ads and subscriptions to keep the lights on. \r\n\n\r\nFirst, advertising dollars go up and down with the economy. We often only know a few months out what our advertising revenue will be, which makes it hard to plan ahead.\r\n\n\r\nSecond, we\u2019re not in the subscriptions business. Vox is here to help everyone understand the complex issues shaping the world \u2014 not just the people who can afford to pay for a subscription. We believe that\u2019s an important part of building a more equal society. We can\u2019t do that if we have a paywall. \r\n \n\r\nThat\u2019s why we also turn to you, our readers, to help us keep Vox free.
