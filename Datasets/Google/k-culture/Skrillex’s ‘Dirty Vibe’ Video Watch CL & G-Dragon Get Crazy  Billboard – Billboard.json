By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJeff Benjamin As any fan will tell you that, at their wildest, K-pop videos remain rather tame. But in Skrillex\u2018s \u201cDirty Vibe\u201d video, two of K-pop\u2019s biggest stars, CL and G-Dragon,\u00a0get wild and unleash a previously unseen side of themselves. Check out the flashy visual to the track that also features Diplo\u00a0co-producing: Explore\t\t\n\t\n\nSee latest videos, charts and news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDiplo\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSkrillex\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nSee latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news In the clip, the stars don some of their most ferocious looks yet: The BIGBANG leader rocks his \u201cGood Boy\u201d\u00a0braids adorned with lollipops, a bandana over his mouth and pants dripping with silver chains; while 2NE1\u2018s \u201cBaddest Female\u201d dons multiple couture-raver costumes, a huge lock as a necklace and a spray-painted mohawk.

G-Dragon and CL have never been conventional K-pop stars, but they completely throw out the scene\u2019s rule book here. Premiered on RedBull.com, Skrillex spoke a little about how the collaboration together. \u201cWe met in Korea when I was out there playing a show,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the time I was working on that track with Diplo. I played it for them and really wanted them to write something for it. So the whole thing happened very organically.\u201d The DJ/producer also said his love for K-pop goes further than this one collabo. \u201cI have always loved the culture of K-pop,\u201d he added. \u201cG-Dragon and CL are such inspiring artists for me. I love the Korean\u2019s crazy over-the-top fashion and how it translates into the music. It\u2019s just really fun music.\u201d Lifted off his\u00a0Recess\u00a0album that peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard 200, \u201cDirty Vibe\u201d reached No. 19 on\u00a0Billboard\u2018s Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart so far \u2014 marking the inaugural appearances for both G-Dragon and CL on the ranking.
