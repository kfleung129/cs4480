    "text": "Veteran K-pop singer and Hollywood actor Rain says he will keep his baby daughter out of the public spotlight, in line with his principles as a sworn family man. The star, born Jung Ji-hoon, also described society as \u201ctoo scary to live in\u201d. \u201cPreviously I thought it was possible to talk about my family happily,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now, if I opened up to the public my child and bragged about how we live, I think it would somehow come back to haunt me. I will build a wall between my family and my job.\u201d Saying he \u201cdoesn\u2019t want his family to get hurt\u201d, the 37-year-old said he had become wary about \u201ctalking about my family openly\u201d. Rain \u2013 who has appeared in Hollywood films such as the 2008 sci-fi action film Speed Racer and Ninja Assassin from 2009 \u2013 married actress Kim Tae-hee in 2017. Their first child was born the same year. Rain confessed he \u201closes his temper\u201d when other people crossed the line with his family members. Admitting he became a \u201cpublic toy\u201d after entering show business, Rain said he could understand if he was \u201cplayed with and thrown away\u201d, but he planned to preserve his \u201cidentities\u201d as an actor, singer and TV personality. Rain\u2019s latest film Um Bok-dong, a historical drama based on a true story about a Korean cyclist during the period under Japanese rule, arrives in theatres on February 27. But for his next project, Rain has been in contact with cinema students to pursue his interest in making independent films. \u201cI don\u2019t mind minor roles,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople ask me why people like me would film an indie movie, but I need new opportunities to get involved in filming.\u201d ",
