    "text": "Following her mom's exit from CBS'\u00a0The Talk,\u00a0Kelly Osbourne has shared her thoughts on \"cancel culture\" and the role the media plays in it. She simply said, \"fuck cancel culture,\" and that \"counsel culture\" is what's actually necessary. \"The world is scary right now, but... it's an honor to be a part of the world when beautiful change is happening,\" Osbourne told Extra TV. \u201cI didn't know what was really going on in this country because I just thought that simply being not racist was enough,\" she continued. \"It\u2019s not, it's actually not, you have to be actively not racist and educate yourself and learn, and don't be afraid to make a mistake.\" Osbourne feels that shunning someone for their actions and words is counterproductive, and people should simply correct others and let them learn as they move forward. \"Everybody's so afraid of cancel culture I say fuck cancel culture, it\u2019s all about counsel culture. Educate people, teach people \u2014 a gentle nudge in the right direction is so much better than a public execution,\" she said. She touched on the subject again in another interview on the\u00a0Everything Iconic\u00a0podcast [via NME], adding that mistakes are necessary for people to learn what is right and wrong, and thus, for change to occur. \"I\u2019ve made mistakes. My mom\u2019s made mistakes. Everybody\u2019s made mistakes,\" she said.\u00a0\u201cBut also, there\u2019s two sides to every story and the media will only ever let you see the one. The one that gets the most clicks. The one that gets the most people fear mongered and outraged.\u201d Listen to the full podcast episode below. Sharon Osbourne\u00a0left\u00a0The Talk\u00a0in March following a string of allegations claiming that she had made racist comments on the set of the show, especially toward fellow cast members. These reports\u00a0came out after\u00a0Sheryl Underwood accused Osbourne of defending racism, because she had publicly voiced support for Piers Morgan.   ",
