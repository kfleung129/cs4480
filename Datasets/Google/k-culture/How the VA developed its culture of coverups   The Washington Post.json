As a first step to cure public mistrust, the Secretary began giving out his own cellphone number.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Read the full update. About two years ago, Brian Turner took a job as a scheduling clerk at a Veterans Affairs health clinic in Austin. A few weeks later, he said, a supervisor came by to instruct him how to cook the books. \u201cThe first time I heard it was actually at my desk. They said, \u2018You gotta zero out the date. The wait time has to be zeroed out,\u2019\u2009\u201d Turner recalled in a phone interview. He said \u201czeroing out\u201d was a trick to fool the VA\u2019s own accountability system, which the bosses up in Washington used to monitor how long patients waited to see the doctor. BREAKING POINTS: WHERE GOVERNMENT FALLS APART Third in a series examining the failures at the heart of troubled federal systems. This is how it worked: A patient asked for an appointment on a specific day. Turner found the next available time slot. But, often, it was many days later than the patient had wanted. Would that later date work? If the patient said yes, Turner canceled the whole process and started over. This time, he typed in that the patient had wanted that later date all along. So now, the official wait time was .\u2009.\u2009. a perfect zero days. In his last public appearance as head of the VA, former Veterans Affairs secretary Eric K. Shinseki gives a speech to a coalition concerned about homeless veterans on Friday morning. Later Friday morning, President Obama announced that Shinseki had resigned after five years on the job. (Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post) It was a lie, of course. But it seemed to be a very important lie, one that the system depended on. \u201cTwo to three times a month, you would hear something about it,\u201d Turner said \u2014 another reminder from supervisors to \u201czero out.\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a secret at all.\u201d But all this was apparently a secret to Secretary Eric K. Shinseki, perched 12 levels above Turner in the VA\u2019s towering bureaucracy. Somewhere underneath Shinseki \u2014 among the undersecretaries and deputy undersecretaries and bosses and sub-bosses \u2014 the fact that clerks were cheating the system was lost. On Friday, Shinseki resigned and was replaced by his deputy. But his departure is unlikely to solve the VA\u2019s broader problem \u2014 a bureaucracy that had been taught, over time, to hide its problems from Washington. Indeed, as President Obama said, one of the agency\u2019s key failings was that bad news did not reach Shinseki\u2019s level at all. This is an ironic development: Until recently, the VA had been seen as a Washington success story. In the 1990s, reformers had cut back on its middle management and started using performance data so managers at the top could keep abreast of problems at the bottom. Then that success began to unravel. As the VA\u2019s caseload increased during two wars, the agency grew thick around the middle again. And then, when the people at the bottom started sending in fiction, the people at the top took it as fact. \u201cShinseki goes up to Capitol Hill, and says, \u2018I didn\u2019t know anything.\u2019 I find it perfectly believable,\u201d said Paul C. Light, a professor at New York University who has studied the bureaucracy of the VA and others in Washington. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a real problem.\u201d Charles R. Forbes, the first head of the U.S. Veterans Bureau, meets with staff. Forbes was chosen by President Warren G. Harding, a poker buddy. He turned out to be an audacious crook, taking kickbacks and selling government supplies at low cost to his cronies. Forbes later went to jail, and his crimes shaped the agency that would become the VA.                                                                            (Library of Congress) For decades, the VA was a byword for bureaucracy itself, seen as Washington\u2019s ultimate paper-pushing, mind-bending hierarchy. That reputation was rooted in the VA\u2019s history: It came about because the agency\u2019s first leader was an audacious crook. Charles Forbes was chosen to head the Veterans Bureau by his poker buddy, President Warren G. Harding, in 1921. He was a poor choice. Forbes took kickbacks. He sold off federal supplies. He wildly misspent taxpayer money \u2014 once buying a 100-year supply of floor wax, enough to polish a floor the size of Indiana, for 25 times the regular price (apparently as a favor to a floor wax company). Eventually, Forbes was caught. The president was unhappy. In 1923, a White House visitor opened the wrong door and found Harding choking Forbes with his bare hands. \u201cYou yellow rat! You double-crossing bastard!\u201d Harding was saying, according to historians. When he noticed the visitor, he let go of Forbes\u2019s neck. Forbes was eventually convicted of bribery and conspiracy. But afterward, the VA\u2019s next leaders built in layers of bureaucracy and paperwork \u2014 to be sure that nobody would ever have the same freedom to steal. Seventy years after Forbes was gone, the place was still wrapped in that red tape. That was clear on the day that Kenneth Kizer \u2014 a reformer appointed by President Bill Clinton \u2014 arrived at the VA\u2019s health service. \u201cI had to approve reimbursement of a secretary .\u2009.\u2009. purchasing a cable for her computer. I think it was something like $11 or $12,\u201d Kizer said. There was a form. He had to sign it personally. \u201cHere I\u2019m running this multibillion dollar organization with \u2014 at that time \u2014 200,000 employees. And I\u2019m having to approve reimbursements for somebody.\u201d Kizer set out to change that. He cut back on staffing at VA headquarters in Washington and at regional headquarters. He cut out layers in the chain of command. And he embraced the idea that statistics could allow the agency\u2019s leaders to peer around those middlemen and see the bottom from the top. If patients at a certain hospital were waiting too long for appointments, they wouldn\u2019t have to wait for the news to travel from a scheduling clerk to a supervisor, from the supervisor to a chief, from the chief to the hospital director, from the hospital director to the region, and from the region to Washington. Instead, Washington could just watch the numbers and see for itself. In theory. Today, 15 years after he left the VA, Kizer said he\u2019s frustrated to see that one of his solutions \u2014 that numbers-based system \u2014 become the problem itself. Instead of alerting the bosses to problems in the field, it has been perverted to cover them up. \u201cThe measures have become the end,\u201d Kizer said in a phone interview from California, \u201cAs opposed to a means to an end.\u201d Last year, Shinseki was given a tour of the VA Medical Center-Hampton, in Hampton, Va. Before taking over the VA, Shinseki spent more than 30 years in the U.S. Army, serving as the Army\u2019s chief of staff from 1999 to 2003.                                                                            (Matt Eich for The Washington Post) Today, even after a massive influx of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans that increased the number of VA patients by nearly 2 million, the VA health system still does many things well. The satisfaction rate for patients who have been treated by the VA is over 80 percent. But in many places, veterans were waiting too long to get the care they need. \u201cWhen you actually get in the room with a doctor, it\u2019s okay. But it\u2019s what it takes to get to that point that I think is the problem,\u201d said Stewart Hickey, national executive director of the veterans service group AMVETS. \u201cYou\u2019re sick today. Three weeks from now, you\u2019re either cured or you\u2019re dead.\u201d One great test of any bureaucracy is whether it can effectively deliver bad news to the top of its chain of command. In recent years, the VA health system started to fail that test. \u201cThat\u2019s what, to me, makes this event so shocking,\u201d said Scott W. Gould, who spent four years as Shinseki\u2019s second-in command. Gould left the VA last year. Gould said that Shinseki tried hard to show he was open to bad news. Three times a year, in fact, Shinseki spent a solid week meeting with regional VA medical directors. That was 63 separate four-hour interviews, every year. But, apparently, his message of openness wasn\u2019t enough: In those hours of meetings, nobody told Shinseki what so many people in his system apparently knew. \u201cI find it shocking that anyone could believe that they were expected to dissemble\u201d about performance measures, Gould said. This is how the system was failing: As the VA\u2019s patient load grew, new layers of middle management slowly reappeared. And all the way at the bottom of the VA\u2019s 12-level chain of command were the schedulers \u2014 the ones who actually had to match veterans with doctors. There were too many of the veterans. There were too few of the doctors. So what should they do? One choice was to tell the truth \u2014 tell the computer how long veterans were actually waiting for an appointment. That was what Shinseki said he wanted, 12 levels up and miles away in Washington. But, according to people with experience in scheduling, it was often the opposite of what lower-level bureaucrats wanted. In some cases, local officials\u2019 bonuses depended on the numbers looking good. So, at some point years ago, they began asking clerks to change the numbers \u2014 with practices like \u201czeroing it out.\u201d Cheating was made easier by the VA\u2019s ancient computer systems, designed decades ago. For many clerks, the choice between the bureaucrats they knew and the secretary they didn\u2019t was obvious. \u201cThey would say, \u2018Change the \u201cdesired date\u201d to the date of the appointment,\u2019\u2009\u201d said one employee knowledgeable about scheduling practices at a VA medical center. The employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, decided to go along with those requests. Fighting the order to lie wasn\u2019t worth it. \u201cYou know, in the end, the veteran got the appointment that was available anyway,\u201d the employee said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t affect the veteran\u2019s care.\u201d (Photo: Larry Downing/Reuters) Way back in 2005, federal auditors found evidence that clerks were not entering the numbers correctly. By 2010, the problem seemed to be widespread, the VA health service sent out a memo listing 17 different \u201cwork-arounds,\u201d including the one that Turner was taught in Texas. Stop it, the VA said. They didn\u2019t. By 2012, in fact, one VA official told Congress he wasn\u2019t sure how to force people to send in the real numbers. \u201cBecause of the fact that the gaming is so prevalent, as soon as something is put out, it is torn apart to look to see what the work-around is,\u201d said William Schoenhard, who was then the deputy undersecretary for health for operations and management, an upper mid-level official that VA employees call the \u201cDushom.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no feedback loop.\u201d That was the key. There was no feedback loop. The system that had been set up to let the top of the VA\u2019s bureaucracy watch the bottom was no longer working. It was sending back science fiction, and the VA\u2019s top brass seemed either ignorant of the deceptions or powerless to stop them. This week, federal auditors provided stark evidence of the problem that VA\u2019s leaders had missed. The auditors had studied 226 veterans who got appointments at the VA medical center in Phoenix. The official data showed they waited an average of 24 days for an appointment. In reality, the average wait was 115 days. Afterward, Shinseki called that finding \u201creprehensible.\u201d But, to the doctor who used to run the VA\u2019s Phoenix emergency room, the findings were no surprise. Katherine Mitchell said that the ER was often overburdened by patients with non-urgent problems, who simply couldn\u2019t get an appointment with their regular doctors. Mitchell said she\u2019s been shifted to another job at the VA after complaining about inadequate staffing and other problems with care in Phoenix. She said Shinseki\u2019s long experience in the U.S. Army had not prepared him well for the VA. \u201cIn the military, if you say, \u2018Do something,\u2019 it\u2019s done,\u201d said Mitchell, who has spent 16 years at the VA. \u201cI suspect that he wasn\u2019t aware that in VA, it\u2019s not like that. If you say, \u2018Do something,\u2019 it\u2019s covered up. It\u2019s fixed by covering it up.\u201d Now, VA\u2019s leaders have been faced with a startling failure. The bureaucracy below them wasn\u2019t telling them the truth about wait times. The numbers system they set up to go around the bureaucracy wasn\u2019t, either. The only answer, now, has been to send people out to VA clinics to talk to schedulers, face to face. Before the auditors went out, they were warned they might hear evidence that clerks had been cheating the system. \u201cIf this occurs, remain calm,\u201d the VA counseled auditors in a memo. It suggested follow-up questions. \u201cHave you brought this to anyone\u2019s attention? If needed, follow up with: What has been the response?\u201d Deep underground, federal employees process paperwork by hand in a long-outdated, inefficient system. Many of the thousands of reports mandated by Congress will only gather dust.
