    "text": "SEARCH Hear those rap interludes, ultra-catchy choruses, and dance breaks? MisterPopoTV is here to show you that African Americans can be into Korean pop music. MisterPopoTV is dressed in what he sarcastically terms the stereotypical look for a black male like himself, \u201cwith a hoodie on, looking like I\u2019m about to rob some bank or stab a couple of people.\u201d His real name is Michael Smith-Grant and he\u2019s a K-pop\u2014Korean pop music\u2014vlogger on YouTube. MisterPopoTV is known for \u201creaction\u201d videos, where he offers opinion on new jams as he watches them, and \u201cunwrapping\u201d videos, where he records himself opening CDs and other merchandise. But mostly, MisterPopoTV\u2019s the mind behind \u201cBlack People React to K-pop,\u201d a series that plays off the idea that it\u2019s unexpected for African Americans listen to K-pop. His subscriber count is almost 45,000. Not bad for his first year on YouTube. Smith-Grant\u2019s ambitions, however, are a bit loftier than just YouTube views. He hopes he can make Koreans see beyond their stereotype of black people as cartoon gangsters, and dispel the false notion that African Americans can\u2019t be into K-pop. \u201cThere\u2019re many closeted black fans out there who will listen to K-pop, but when their friends come around, they\u2019ll switch to hip-hop or something else,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid of being bashed for liking something that people don\u2019t understand.\u201d In the past five years, K-pop has developed a loyal following in America, with leading acts like Girls\u2019 Generation and EXO performing sold-out shows on both coasts. In 2011, 15,000 people attended a Madison Square Garden gig organized by record label SM Entertainment, which featured Girls\u2019 Generation and other popular artistes like Super Junior and SHINee. A recent graduate of New York University, Smith-Grant was introduced to K-pop a few years ago by a friend who told him about a four-member girl group called KARA. Typical of K-pop girl groups, KARA\u2019s appeal lies in its rainbow-colored, larger-than-life music videos, featuring impossibly good-looking and identically dressed women\u2014often enhanced by plastic surgery\u2014performing perfectly synchronized choreography that highlights the girls\u2019 aegyo, a Korean term for the unique cuteness or charm of a young woman. In fact, MisterPopoTV was named after one of KARA\u2019s songs. MisterPopoTV isn\u2019t alone in his mission. Donte Jefferson and Nia Jackson, freshmen at Louisiana State University, founded a Tumblr group called Black K-pop Fans in 2011. At its inception, the blog had about 300 followers. Today, that number has grown to over 3,500. An anime fanatic in middle school, Jackson thought to herself one day: \u201cHey, maybe I should try watching real people.\u201d She soon found the popular Korean drama Full House, which featured one of the nation\u2019s biggest stars, Rain, a 31 year-old actor who has appeared in American films, most notably 2008\u2019s Speed Racer. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my god, Rain, you\u2019re very attractive,\u2019 so I looked him up, and found that he could sing and dance,\u201d Jackson recalls. \u201cI thought, \u2018There might be more Korean stars like you.\u2019\u201d Jackson says that at first, her parents thought it was strange and discouraged her from getting into Korean pop stars. But they\u2019ve since come around to the idea. \u201cMy parents noticed that there were these people on my computer screen who were all Asians,\u201d Jefferson says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t say anything for a while, but one day, my dad came to me and was like, \u2018So, what\u2019s going on? There\u2019re a lot of Korean people. What\u2019s happening here?\u2019I told him it\u2019s just music. It doesn\u2019t matter what language it\u2019s in.\u201d For most African-American fans of K-pop, the genre\u2019s hip-hop influences act as a gateway drug. K-pop fans who want to expose the genre to their friends typically introduce them to Korean hip-hop-influenced groups like Big Bang or Block B, Jackson says. With beats that resemble American hip-hop, the only hurdle possible converts have to get over then is just the unfamiliar language. \u201cSome people, especially black people, say that I have hatred for my own race because of the music that I like,\u201d Smith-Grant says. \u201cSeriously?\u201d *** K-pop\u2019s relationship to hip-hop goes back to the early 1990s, with the emergence of the band called Seo Taiji and Boys. The group rocked the previously conservative Korean music scene with its incorporation of diverse elements of American music, like gangsta rap, breakdance, and even rock. Seo Taiji\u2019s seminal song is \u201cCome Back Home,\u201d and it begins with a fast-talking, high-pitched rap. If Seo Taiji weren\u2019t rapping in Korean, you would\u2019ve thought that \u201cCome Back Home\u201d was a Cypress Hill song. \u201cSeo Taiji and Boys brought a certain kind of authentic-sounding, harder gangster rap to Korea,\u201d says Michael Hurt, an African-American Ph.D. candidate at UC Berkeley\u2019s Comparative Ethnic Studies department. Hurt moved to Korea 12 years ago to work on his dissertation on Korean national identity and how that evolved in response to the country\u2019s swift economic growth. He now lives in Seoul, where he teaches at Hongik University and also works as a freelance fashion photographer. Seo Taiji and Boys was a breakout success in South Korea, and the group\u2019s music\u2014rap interludes, ultra-catchy choruses and dance breaks\u2014became the template for future K-pop acts. After the group disbanded in 1996, band member Yang Hyun-Seok went on to found YG Entertainment, one of the South Korea\u2019s \u201cBig Three\u201d record labels. Today, top YG acts like Big Bang, 2NE1, and Psy still produce American-by-way-of-Seo Taiji music, complete with flashy dance videos. Consider a song like \u201cCrayon\u201d by G-Dragon, a member of the boy band Big Bang. Take away the Korean lyrics (the song also feature lines in English, as many K-pop songs do in an attempt to appeal to international audiences) and you\u2019re left with pulsating synths and heavy beats that wouldn\u2019t sound out of place on American radio. K-pop stars have also done several high-profile collaborations with African-American artists in the past few years. Missy Elliott, Kanye West, will.i.am, and Chris Brown have all either featured on or participated in the production of K-pop tracks. To be clear, hip-hop music and culture have become an influential force all across the globe, so Korean pop stars are hardly the only ones copying it. But Korea appears to have taken it to another level, says Darren Zook, an expert in the Korean Peninsula who lectures at the University of Berkeley. Many K-pop stars have proclaimed their love for what is perceived to be black culture. When asked about the type of music his group does, Bang Yong Guk, of the boy band B.A.P. (an acronym for \u201cBest Absolute Perfect\u201d), told the Korea website AllKpop, \"All the members love African-American music filled with soul. If I can be born again, I'd like to be born as an African-American and do music.\" \u201cIf you go to South Korea, there\u2019s all sorts of dance studios with signs that say: Learn b-boy dancing here, and all the pictures in flyers will show African Americans, even though you won\u2019t actually find any African Americans in the dance classes,\u201d Zook says. \u201cKorean breakdance groups have embraced the image of African American breakdance culture\u2014the dress, the attitude, the hand gestures. But the problem is that the issues that generated breakdancing in the U.S. don\u2019t\u2019 exist in Korea,\u201d he continues. \u201cK-pop has the image of inner city life, but its lyrics are very harmless. Nobody\u2019s talking about oppression by another group and nobody is talking about gun culture.\u201d Zook\u2019s critique of K-pop is similar to the way white rappers like Macklemore have been criticized in the U.S. for appropriating the \u201cglamorous\u201d aspects of what is perceived to be African-American hip-hop culture. In the same vein, K-pop stars have also \u201cbecome very good at mimicking the superficial coolness of black cultural products,\u201d Hurt notes. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure most of the Korean rappers come from nice families in the suburbs, not, from the \u2018hood\u2019 or anything like that,\u201d Jackson says. \u201cI guess they\u2019re inspired by their favorite singers and rappers and they just want to rap or dance like them, whether they understand what they\u2019re listening to or not,\u201d Jefferson adds. But Hurt argues that a K-pop star wanting to rap or dance like African-American artists is problematic because there isn\u2019t a genuine desire to connect with black culture.  \u201cWhat\u2019s really happening is that they are trying to take on the accouterments of blackness in the way they understand it, and add that to whatever they\u2019re doing,\u201d Hurt says. He cites the example of \u201cheukhyeong,\u201d which started popping up in Korean online communities in the mid-2000s. The Korean term literally translates to \u201cblack bro.\u201d While it is commonly known as a term of affection used to describe black people who are good at sports or music that Koreans admire, it is still a stereotype. Hurt believes this phenomenon is another way Korean culture \u201cwants to mimic or superficially connect with what I think are superficial aspects of black culture.\u201d Heukyeong, he says, actually refers to the aesthetic that is commonly ascribed to African-American hip-hop culture\u2014\u201cthis really big, cut, masculine sexual predator-ish image of a black male. That\u2019s what hyeukyeong really means in a Korean\u2019s eyes.\u201d To Koreans, Hurt, even though he is black, wouldn\u2019t be considered a heukhyeong. \u201cI have experiences where people say to me, \u2018Yeah, I want hang out with black people,\u2019 and I think: I\u2019m obviously identified as black. I think Americans would know I\u2019m a black person,\u201d he says. \u201cBut for Koreans, black people look like people they see in the music videos. I don\u2019t look like that, so I think people see me as just racially Other.\u201d *** In March, hip-hop group Bangtan Boys (BTS) covered a song called \u201cT.O.P\u201d by the Korean boy band Shinhwa. The song includes the line \"Y'all n***** better know.\" The BTS\u2019s Rap Monsta didn\u2019t censor himself on live Korean television. When Snoop Dogg was in Seoul for a meet-and-greet session with fans last year, a young man came dressed in blackface, with a big-haired wig and posed for pictures with Snoop. And two years ago, MBC, a Korean television network, uploaded onto YouTube a Lunar New Year show in which two female comedians painted their faces black to impersonate Michol, a black character from a popular Korean cartoon, Dooly the Little Dinosaur. Incidents of blackface and other similarly offensive events happen so often in Korean pop culture that one might attribute it to some sort of cultural naivet\u00e9 or ignorance of historical context. Hurt doesn\u2019t think so. \u201cThe cultural naivet\u00e9 excuse, which I do think is a small factor, starts becoming a big excuse to hide behind, because they should know better today,\u201d he says. He cites the example of the Bubble Sisters, a four-piece girl group that made its debut in 2003. On their album cover, their faces are painted black and they\u2019re wearing braided wigs and baby pajamas. \u201cTheir image is essentially that of pickaninnies and jigaboos\u2014a very specifically historical image of infantilized black people,\u201d Hurt says. \u201cTo say, \u2018Oh, we didn\u2019t know it was offensive,\u2019 doesn\u2019t make sense, because in your research, you\u2019d have come across the fact that this look is from an offensive genre in American pop culture.\u201d Jackson agrees. \u201cIf SNL decides to paint a white person yellow, tape back their eyes, and have a bowl cut and speak Engrish, Korea would go batshit,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a legitimate excuse to say, \u2018Oh, we didn\u2019t know it was offensive.\u2019\u201d The central tension underlying K-pop\u2019s racial issues, Zook says, is that the racially homogenous Korea is still uncomfortable and struggling with globalization and the import of not just African-American culture, but any foreign culture. \u201cKorea is the same stage of globalization as America was in the \u201890s, where it\u2019s about consuming other cultures, not connecting with them,\u201d Hurts says. \u201cWhen I was teaching at Berkeley in the \u201890s, the phrase \u2018cultural appropriation\u2019 wasn\u2019t in the cultural vocabulary at that time. \u201cIn terms of race, the only way the mainstream Korean media can frame the issue is: \u2018Oh, a Korean K-pop fan said offensive thing to piss off black people. Black people now hate Korea. This is a problem.\u2019 Koreans are stuck at: \u2018Well we like black people, why can\u2019t we look like black people? I make my face dark, its cool right?\u2019 No, it\u2019s not.\" Earlier this year, Smith-Grant visited Seoul for the first time. He stayed for five days. \u201cPeople stared at me all the time,\u201d he says. \u201cProbably because I\u2019m a big black guy.\u201d With the success of his MisterPopoTV, Smith-Grant\u2019s series of videos now show up as the top results when you search \u201cBlack People React To\u201d on YouTube\u2014pushing all the other videos that perpetuate racist stereotypes down. \u201cFor the first five pages of search results, you get mainly all my videos. And given the attention span of people on YouTube, no one is going to look past page 3,\u201d he says with pride. On the comments sections of his videos, K-pop fans of all nationalities and ethnicities leave comments in English, Korean, and several other languages. Some find Smith-Grant\u2019s videos interesting. Some hate them. No matter for MisterPopoTV. For him, it\u2019s important that the comments discuss the music, and nothing else. \u201cJust as it should be,\u201d he says. Got a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast\u00a0here. ",
