    "text": "The Plant drew on the chicken and beer joints of Korea and their offspring on New York\u2019s Lower East Side in creating the brilliant branding and interiors for Wing Wing, a new fast food spot in central London. Written by:\n    Emily Gosling 23 June 2017 All bright popping colours and Memphis-like patterns, the energy of the whole thing is inspired by K-Pop. The agency created a bespoke wordmark which features the Korean characters for \"Chimaek\", and a was logo created from the \u201cWW\u201d to be used across the identity. \"The bright colours and bold graphics are matched with equally provocative copy, creating a fun, engaging experience,\" says The Plant. These are echoed in the interiors of the space, which use abstracted patterns and see cute little icons adorn the concrete walls and floors. All in all, it\u2019s a knowingly Instagram-savvy spot. \"A hyperreal space that reflects the colour and energy of K-Pop, the aim of the space is to create a mood that's both\u00a0fast food and cool bar,\" the agency adds. The Plant\u2019s designs are shown across all touch-points including the Wing Wing menu systems, website and uniforms.
