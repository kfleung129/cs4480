By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJeff Benjamin A few weeks back, British radio listeners very well may have double checked their radio dials when they heard Korean music playing on their airwaves. The audiences may have been doubly surprised to hear one of their most famous DJs then profess his love for Korean pop. It\u2019s all thanks to Sam Ranns, a 22-year-old K-pop fan from the countryside who won a spot on BBC Radio 1\u2019s \u2018Access All Areas\u2019 contest. It gave normal folk the chance to use the famous lounge \u2014 that\u2019s recently hosted the likes of HAIM,\u00a0Kings of Leon\u00a0and more \u2014 to record their own hour-long show in the famous studios. Related\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBTS' V Drops Two Very Different Remixes of 'Slow Dancing' Solo Single\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t04/22/2014 The\u00a0Cambridgeshire native with a soft spot for Girls\u2019 Generation won one of the 39 available spots used to play whatever he liked, just like the other winners. What he learned after his hour was up was that BBC DJ Scott Mills was listening in on his broadcast and eventually played \u2014 to borrow a phrase Ranns used on-air \u2014 \u201cbeautifully addicting\u201d K-pop tracks live on public British radio\u2026 very much unlike the other winners. Listen to an excerpt below where Mills begins playing Rann\u2019s broadcast \u2014 even though he\u2019s \u201cnot supposed to do this\u201d \u2014 and reveals his love for K-pop, PSY and one of the scene\u2019s biggest stars G-Dragon, much to surprise of his co-host.  Speaking about the experience, Ranns tells Billboard, \u201cshock, fear, and amazement pretty much round up how I felt\u201d over his hijacked radio show. \u201c\u2018Access All Areas\u2019 was promoted as 60 minutes in the studio doing what you want and then they would give you a USB stick with your show,\u201d he says. \u201cBut here I was halfway through my show with Scott Mills playing some of the songs I chose to quite possibly millions of listeners. I really couldn\u2019t believe it and it threw me for a loop.\u201d Ranns says he was equally thrown learning the award-winning broadcaster was a fellow fan. He says, \u201cI knew that he interviewed PSY when \u2018Gangnam Style\u2019 was big over here, but I thought that was where it ended. My producer for the day did say before I got into the studio that I was brought in that day because Scott would be very interested in my content and I\u2019m so glad he is.\u201d   But this wasn\u2019t just a chance for Ranns to play his favorite K-pop songs, he adds that a lot of preparation went in to make the program as accessible to new audiences as possible. \u201cMy original idea was to try and find a song that everybody would enjoy, but it turned into more of a \u2018K-pop for Beginners\u2019 which turned out to work really well,\u201d he explains. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to seem biased towards any group or company, so I had to spend a long time debating with my online friends and the community what deserved to be on the playlist.\u201d The result was a mix of the most-viewed K-pop tracks on YouTube like BIGBANG\u2019s \u201cFantastic Baby,\u201d and 2NE1\u2019s \u201cI Am the Best\u201d (\u201cNo brainers,\u201d says Ranns) to recent favorites of longtime fans (Brown Eyed Girls\u2019 \u201cAbracadabra,\u201d Shinwa\u2019s \u201cHurts,\u201d\u00a0INFINITE\u2019s \u201cThe Chaser,\u201d T-ara\u2019s \u201cRoly Poly,\u201d) peppered with facts about South Korean and K-pop culture. He even spun one of PSY\u2019s pre-\u201cGangnam Style\u201d hits, 2010\u2019s \u201cRight Now.\u201d  But when it came to introduce his favorite act for the finale track, Ranns admitted he was nearly \u201cspeechless\u201d gearing up to play Girls\u2019 Generation\u2019s \u201cGenie (Tell Me Your Wish).\u201d \u201cI remember very vividly how I got into K-pop, and it was all because of Girls\u2019 Generation\u2019s \u2018Mr. Taxi\u2019 video,\u201d he explains. \u201cI watched it a couple of times and got hooked, which lead me to explore\u2026they introduced me to a completely different world of music, and if it wasn\u2019t for them I wouldn\u2019t be doing some of the things I\u2019m doing now.\u201d While Ranns admits that K-pop \u201cmight be considered too different to become the norm\u201d in the quiet countryside where he\u2019s from, he\u2019s hopeful for its growth in the country\u2019s capital. \u201cIn a busy city like London with a huge mixture of cultures, I could definitely see it becoming big. Just last month, [Asian-pop mashup artist]\u00a0DJ MASA performed a set in a London night club and it seemed like everybody there was loving it.\u201d At the very least, he now knows he\u2019s got a very influential fellow fan supporting K-pop in the UK.
