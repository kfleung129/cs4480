Chapman and dedicated on Memorial Day 2011, the commemorative dog tag statue features a reflective surface that brings viewers into the art.

The memorial is displayed in the outdoor plaza on the east side of McCain Auditorium. Anderson Hall is a state-recognized historic building. The bells that ring every hour were installed in the tower in 1965, and the building has previously held a canteen, a barber shop and a chapel. Many students will enter this building to visit the Division of Financial Services, the Office of the Registrar or the Office of Military Affairs. The Bluemont Bell, located in the Holen Courtyard outside of Bluemont Hall, is a monument every student should see. Originally created at Bluemont College, just a mile west of the original K-State campus, it was used to call students to class. A hidden treasure on campus is the Seaton Hall Courtyard. This small sanctuary is tucked away between Seaton Hall and Seaton Court and offers a serene place for students to sit and eat lunch or study in between classes. Lover\u2019s Lane is a road that runs east-west on the K-State campus, connecting Mid-Campus Drive with Manhattan Avenue.

Graves Family Courtyard is located near the Johnson Center for Basic Cancer Research, which is located close to Ackert Hall. It is a very soothing, relaxing place to sit and work on homework at one of the tables while listening to the sounds of nature and the courtyard\u2019s small waterfall. There are many other wonderful places to visit on the K-State campus. One of those places is Radina\u2019s Coffeehouse and Roastery in the Leadership Studies Building.
