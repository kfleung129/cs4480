The park, which lies within the unceded traditional territory of KFN, served as a camp during canoe trips and a resource for harvesting for many Indigenous people. K\u2019\u00f3moks Elected Chief Nicole Rempel along with staff from the CVRD assisted on new signage which celebrates the traditional languages of the K\u2019\u00f3moks First Nation and reflects a variety of flora and fauna. The signs - 32 in total - also feature phonetic pronunciations. \u201cFor me, (the event) is a step toward reconciliation, and reconciliation in our own community with a language not utilized in many years and really trying to revitalize that within the community,\u201d says Rempel. \u201cIt\u2019s a great first step in getting it out into the broader community in the Valley \u2026 (but) to recognize our history. It\u2019s a diverse history with three different languages to learn that - it\u2019s a big challenge to learn that.\u201d The signs use designated colours to assist park users with navigation and to indicate where they can ride bikes or horses in addition to hiking and are designed to blend in within the natural environment  photos@comoxvalleyrecord.comLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter Be Among The First To Know Sign up for a free account today, and receive top headlines in your inbox Monday to Saturday.
