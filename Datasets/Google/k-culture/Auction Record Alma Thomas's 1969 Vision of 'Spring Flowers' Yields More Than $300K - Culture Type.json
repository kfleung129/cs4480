Grounded in pink, the mesmerizing square canvas is a rhythmic composition of pattern and color. Nearly four hours after the Modern Art & Design Auction started on March 5, the painting came up for bid and garnered sustained attention. The estimate was $125,000-$175,000. Bidding began at $110,000 and more than a dozen bids were offered. A phone bidder bested the competition. The hammer price was $310,000. With the final price far exceeding the estimate, applause erupted in the room and the auctioneer announced the winning price was an auction record for a work by Thomas. Including fees, the painting yielded $387,500, and was the top lot of the auction. According to LA Modern Auctions, \u201cSpring Flowers in Washington\u201d has never been exhibited and was seen publicly for the first time at the auction preview. Thomas made the oil on canvas painting in 1969 and sold it to an African American college student who visited her home studio that same year. The California undergraduate bought the painting in installments and when he sent his final payment, Thomas had it boxed up and mailed it to him in San Diego. She enclosed a hand-written note in the package, closing with the following sentiment: \u201cI hope you will love the painting. So many of my friends want to buy it. I am painting more and more.\u201d \u201cI hope you will love the painting. So many of my friends want to buy it. I am painting more and more.\u201d \u2014 Alma Thomas, 1969 After going on to medical school, becoming a doctor, and settling in the Los Angeles area, the man who bought the painting died in 2012. His family, wishing to remain anonymous, consigned \u201cSpring Flowers in Washington D.C.,\u201d for sale at the auction. The letter from Thomas was included in the lot along with the painting.
