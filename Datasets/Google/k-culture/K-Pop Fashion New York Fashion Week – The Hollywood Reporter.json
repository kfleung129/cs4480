By \n\n\tTamar Herman, Billboard Ruffles, unicorns, and grunge came out in full force at this week\u2019s Concept Korea show to highlight why the fashion world has all eyes on a country better known for music and skincare. In its fourteenth season, the Korean-government sponsored show has become a New York Fashion Week staple. Backed by the sonic amalgamation of hip-hop, K-pop, and the New York Orchestra, Korean designers Yohanix, KimmyJ, and Greedilous (pronounced \u201cgreedyous\u201d), each brought their own flair to Pier 59 on Thursday morning. Yohanix\u2019s aggressively dark streetwear contrasted with the lines presented by KimmyJ and Greedilous as the former\u2019s playful, fantastical outfits took their neon cues straight from the \u201870s and the latter\u2019s bright graphics wowed the audience. Altogether, the three designers presenting at Concept Korea offered a general representation of South Korea\u2019s populist attitude towards fashion through their highly accessible clothing lines.  Brought to New York by the Korea Creative Content Agency (KOCCA) and hosted by the Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism, Concept Korea\u2019s aim is to spread up-and-coming designers and the style culture of South Korea. While K-beauty and Korean pop culture, including K-pop, television dramas, and film, have growing presence around the world, South Korea\u2019s designers are still angling for their place in the international fashion scene. \u201cThe main objective of Concept Korea and KOCCA is to focus on the fashion more,\u201d said Kyeonghwa Ji via translator ahead of the event. \u201cWe expect that New York Fashion Week will help raise interest in the designers and sales ahead of their upcoming shows in London, Paris, and Milan.\u201d Korea\u2019s fashion-forward culture has led to the country\u2019s recognition as a burgeoning style hub and trendsetter. South Korea is often a predictor of what fashion trends eventually emerge in America and Europe. For example,\u00a0Seoulites were flaunting chokers more than a year before the \u201990s trend resurfaced in the U.S. The mainstay of Korean fashion is its versatility, and designers featured at Seoul Fashion Week typically eschew couture in favor of favor wearable, comfortable fashion.  Yohanix\u2019s punk rock line meshed urbanwear with elaborate details, including asymmetrical hems, heavy metallic embellishments, and open-faced jeans creating what designer Yohan (Taegeun) Kim calls \u201cstreet carpet\u201d fashion. \u201cIt\u2019s a combined word of streetwear and red carpet,\u201d said Kim, who graduated from the London College of Fashion and worked with Balmain Paris before starting his own line, which has since graced popular K-pop stars like Choi Sooyong and Kim Taeyeon of Girls\u2019 Generation. \u201cWe try to imagine that whoever is wearing our garment in the street would look like she can be on the red carpet.\u201d Free-flowing ruffles and lace were paired with leather, spray paint smiley faces, and graphic T-shirts to create the designer\u2019s idea of \u201cstreet carpet\u201d fashion. The youngest of the three, and fan favorite amongst K-pop stars such as f(x), Sistar, Girls\u2019 Generation, and AOA,\u00a0KimmyJ flaunted the definition of high fashion. Casual items such as bright track suits, khakis, athletic wear, and jean overalls contrasted with her poppish unicorn-emblazoned items and flowing robes based on Korean hanboks. \u201cI wanted easy, everyday outfits that utilize special silhouettes,\u201d KimmyJ\u2019s Heejin Kim said via translator. \u201cI added a lot of embroidery featuring easy western motifs and Asian aspects, and also mixed in \u201870s hip hop [style].\u201d  The morning ended with Greedious\u2019s flamboyantly patterned line; not a single outfit lacked the brand\u2019s typical bold graphics. Despite the colors and wild designs, the collection featured a more professional tone than the preceding lines, showcasing business suits, blazers, slacks, and dresses alongside more casual pieces. Designer Younhee Park incorporated structured ruffles and Lucite heels into the collection for added flare. \u201cI wanted to make a collection specifically for New York.\u201d Park told The Hollywood Reporter via translator. \u201cI really want to see more color in New York City. It\u2019s all black! I made pieces that can easily be mixed and matched naturally with the black New Yorkers love so much.\u201d Park, whose clothes have been seen on everyone from Beyonce\u00a0to popular California-born K-pop star Amber\u00a0from the girl group f(x), also expressed feeling more international awareness of Korean fashion following the rise of interest in K-beauty and Korean pop culture in general. \u201cBecause of the popularity in K-fashion, I feel that there\u2019s more of an interest by the media and the world in Korean designers,\u201d said Park. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been able to grow more as a designer, as myself, because of it.\u201d While Hallyu, or the Korean Wave, predominantly revolves around pop cultural exports, the phrase extends to style, occasionally referred to as K-fashion. Because of their popularity, Korean actors and K-pop stars are regarded as trendsetters worldwide and several have made appearances at New York Fashion Week in the past. While prominent Korean stars were absent from Concept Korea this year, models walked down to several K-pop songs rearranged to match the accompaniment of the New York Orchestra, including Baauer\u2019s \u201cTemple\u201d featuring M.I.A and G-Dragon, the frontman of K-pop boy band BIGBANG. The finale, \u201cGood Boy\u201d by G-Dragon and BIGBANG\u2019s Taeyang was a fan favorite, with many audience-members opting to stay until the end of the performance to record one of Korea\u2019s trendiest exports and post it on Instagram. Over by 11 a.m., Concept Korea made a compelling, and stylish, argument about the artistry coming out of South Korea\u2019s creative minds.
