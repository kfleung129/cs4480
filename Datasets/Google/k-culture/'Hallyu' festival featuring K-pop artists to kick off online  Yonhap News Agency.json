In its first week, the festival will focus on Russia and host programs where K-pop groups such as The Boyz, Lovelyz and CIX introduce South Korean beauty trends and customs observed during the Chuseok holiday, which falls on Sept. 20-22 this year. On Sept. 12, the final day of the Russia focus week, participants in the two countries will be able to meet online at 6 p.m. to share each other's lifestyles and cultures and stage K-pop performances. India's focus week will run from Oct. 4-10, featuring K-pop stars Monsta X, Pentagon and AB6IX. Indonesia's will follow from Nov. 8-14, with appearances by A.C.E. and Dreamcatcher. Mokkoji Korea was originally conceived as an in-person hallyu festival involving \"new southern\" countries, which comprise India and the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and \"new northern\" countries, including Russia, Mongolia and other Eurasian states. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the event was held online last year, with the participation of more than 2 million people from 165 countries, according to the ministry. This year's festival will be viewable at mokkojikorea.com. Details of the program can also be found on the site in English and the languages of the three focus countries. hague@yna.co.kr\n(END) All News National North Korea Economy/Finance Biz Culture/K-pop Sports Images Videos Top News Most Viewed Korean Newspaper Headlines Today in Korean History Yonhap News Summary Editorials from Korean Dailies Korea in Brief Useful Links Festival Calendar Weather Advertise with Yonhap News Agency ",
