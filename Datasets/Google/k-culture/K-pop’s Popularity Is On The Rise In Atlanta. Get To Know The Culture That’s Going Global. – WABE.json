    "text": "Final hours of the On-Air Campaign. Give now! Lauren Booker\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWABE January 22nd, 2019 Luchia Arecco and Sam Richardson are fans of K-pop, the music genre that\u2019s becoming a worldwide phenomenon. Lauren Booker / WABE Atlanta is home to the\u00a0KPOP STORE in\u00a0USA, which is owned and operated by a family that emigrated from South Korea 15 years ago. The business, located on Buford Highway, has been selling K-pop cultural goodies, such as CDs, posters and glow sticks, for five years after transitioning from operating as a long-running video rental store. \u201cMy whole family likes K-pop, which I think helps us a lot in this business,\u201d Daniel Lim, manager of the KPOP STORE in\u00a0USA, said. \u201cWhen I first moved here, there wasn\u2019t a lot of K-pop lovers, but I wanted them to hear Korean music \u2026 Right now, I think it\u2019s succeeding in the American market with BTS.\u201d Korean Pop Music, or K-pop, has grown to become a multifaceted, audiovisual musical powerhouse, with its popularity stretching around the world. In Atlanta, the genre\u2019s influence can be seen in the city\u2019s robust K-pop scene composed of song cover groups, concert planning agencies and social media bloggers.  \u201cIt\u2019s only in the last year or two with BTS and some [K-pop groups] that I think K-pop has actually\u00a0began\u00a0to appeal to mainstream audiences in the U.S.,\u201d\u00a0John Lie, author of \u201cK-Pop: Popular Music, Cultural Amnesia, and Economic Innovation in South Korea,\u201d said. Seven-member boy band BTS, whose chart-topping K-pop hits include \u201cIDOL\u201d and \u201cFake Love,\u201d has made headlines for being the most\u00a0tweeted-about\u00a0artist in 2017, and for remaining No. 1 for the\u00a0Social 50 chart\u00a0for over 100 weeks since 2010. Over the years, Lim said sales have been increasing, which the local K-pop store reports to Billboard to help contribute to artists\u2019 placement on the charts. \u201cThere are many people who love K-pop,\u201d Lim said. Ever since\u00a0K-pop pioneers Seo Taiji & Boys first hit the scene in 1992, the genre has grown to become a worldwide phenomenon, which has, in turn, helped to increase the South Korean music industry\u2019s worth to around\u00a0$5 billion. \u201cI think one of the major reasons why people get attracted to K-pop is bright colors, loud music, pretty people and dancing,\u201d Laine Rutledge, Atlanta-based K-pop fan and YouTuber, said. \u201cI think that K-pop is something everyone can like.\u201d K-pop has a mix of influences from Western music genres, including hip-hop and R&B, along with J-pop dance culture, according to \u201cToward a Gendered Aesthetics of K-pop.\u201d \u201cInitially the popularity of K-pop began among Korean Americans \u2026 who knew about K-pop from their friends or relatives or from social media, \u201d Lie,\u00a0sociology\u00a0professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said K-pop fandom can be found in the K-pop specialty shops and artist\u00a0tours\u00a0popping up around the U.S. and Atlanta. K-pop was designed to appeal to people outside of South Korea, according to Lie. \u201cBy the time K-pop emerged sometime in various ways in the 1990s [to] early 2000s, they had begun something that people outside of Korea could really appreciate if they were used to American-influenced pop music,\u201d Lie said. He said the music style has staying power because the sound is constantly evolving to suit what\u2019s trendy at the time. \u201cIt keeps on changing because the pop music charts keep on changing, the trends, what\u2019s cool and what\u2019s hot,\u201d Lie said. \u201cThere is something of eternal youth in pop music.\u201d Even though Korean isn\u2019t Luchia\u00a0Arecco\u2019s\u00a0and Sam Richardson\u2019s first language, the music resonates with the high school students from Cumming, Georgia.

You can understand what they are saying just by how they are performing and you can understand their feelings just by the patterns in the songs,\u201d Richardson said.\nArecco and Richardson are members of\u00a0Strawberry Silk, a local K-Culture blog and cover group.

So with K-pop, a lot of the time they are not just standing and singing. They\u2019re singing, and they\u2019re dancing, and they\u2019re putting on a whole show,\u201d Richardson, 18, said. \u201cAnd so coming from a performer\u2019s perspective, it really draws you in, whereas sometimes [with] American music, they kind of just stand there.\u201d\nK-pop in the \u201cHollywood of the South\u201d\nDynamic, live performances\u00a0is\u00a0one reason fans are attracted to the music genre and culture.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to concerts where people are like, \u2018I don\u2019t know who these people are.\u2019 And they come out of the concert, \u2018I\u2019m total fans.\u2019 I\u2019ve seen that happen so many times, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Wow the impact definitely got to them.

You really can\u2019t go wrong with the Hollywood of the South,\u201d Rackthai said. \u201cWith the Hollywood industry making its way through here, K-pop is definitely for sure going to make it here in Atlanta.\u201d\nThe newly started business specializes in event organization, local marketing, food catering\u00a0and\u00a0transportation services for K-pop\u00a0events, such as the K-Expo in New York and the Paint It Rose Tour in Atlanta.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen people of all ages at concerts \u2026 whenever you check the social media, I\u2019ve always seen people [say], \u2018How old are you?
