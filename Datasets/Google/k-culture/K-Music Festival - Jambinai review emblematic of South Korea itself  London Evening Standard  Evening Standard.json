    "text": "Culture | Music Recently London seems to have discovered Korean food with lots of new restaurants serving delicacies that are fresh and fiery. The K-Music Festival is bringing equally intriguing musical flavours from Korea. Last night\u2019s band, Jambinai, have acquired a cult status, having appeared at Glastonbury and other festivals round the world. This was their first London show. They are emblematic of South Korea itself \u2014 a country with deep traditional roots that is simultaneously at the cutting edge. That is the nature of Jambinai\u2019s music. The core of the band is three musicians \u2014 Bomi Kim, Eun Yong Shim and Il Woo Lee \u2014 who play the traditional fiddle (haegeum), zither (geomungo) and oboe (piri) and electric guitar. They began with just the trio, playing extraordinary angst-ridden pieces. One slowly built on repeated plucks, electronics and screams on the fiddle building to a tumultuous climax and then leaving just the plaintive oboe playing. Then they were joined by bass guitar and drums for transcendental grooves that had the whole audience swaying. \u201cThanks for coming to see us even though we\u2019re a strange band from South Korea,\u201d said guitarist Lee. What gives them their appeal is the way they bring a thrash metal approach to traditional instruments with go-faster gizmos. The audience loved it, but perhaps didn\u2019t know what to make of it at the same time.
