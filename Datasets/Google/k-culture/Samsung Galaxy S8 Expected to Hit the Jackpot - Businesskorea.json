    "text": " According to UK retailer Carphone Warehouse, the number of pre-orders for the Samsung Galaxy S8 has reached 143% in comparison to the same event for the Galaxy S7 it held last year. In South Korea, approximately 550,000 consumers chose the product during pre-sale for two days. Carphone Warehouse is a mobile device retailer that has about 2,400 stores in Europe. Its presale kicked off on March 29 (local time). The retailer mentioned that British consumers are enthusiastic about the Galaxy S8 and a lot of them experienced the phone in its hands-on zones. Industry experts are saying that the Galaxy S8 is likely to become the most popular one of the Galaxy phones of Samsung Electronics. In the United States, every major mobile carrier, such as Verizon and AT&T, has launched large marketing campaigns for the product. It seems that a large number of users are very much interested in the 18.5:9 screen ratio of the Galaxy S8. This product comes with not only this screen ratio but also an infinity display, that is, extremely thin upper and lower edges on the front face of the product. Samsung Electronics is planning to allow the pre-sale customers and the other customers to use the phone from April 18 and 21, respectively. Never miss another article!
