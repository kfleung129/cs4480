    "text": "By Kwak Yeon-soo Alongside the rip-roaring success of K-pop, the genre\u2019s music videos also have staying power in the age of YouTube. The platform\u2019s views and comments are seen as useful gauges of a music video\u2019s success. The colourful, choreography-heavy video for Idol, a song by K-pop sensation BTS, set a record this year as the most-viewed Korean music video within a 24-hour period on YouTube, garnering a staggering 45 million views. To date, it holds second place among all genres following Ariana Grande\u2019s clip for Thank U, Next. And the video for Ddu-du-Ddu-du by K-pop group Blackpink is ranked fifth, amassing 36.2 million views in one day. The people behind the videos rarely receive any recognition. Praising creative direction isn\u2019t a priority for mainstream fans \u2013 they are more interested in the performers\u2019 looks and voices. \u201cWe music video directors aren\u2019t recognised by the public much because we work behind the camera,\u201d said music video director Kim Sung-wook. \u201cI\u2019m totally fine with that, but I just hope they take notice of talented directors who have great potential but fewer opportunities in this field.\u201d Kim, an acclaimed director known for making music videos with unique creativity and sensitivity, earned fame after working on BTS music videos, including Dope, Save Me, Young Forever, Not Today and MIC Drop. Other K-pop stars he has worked with include Red Velvet, Big Bang\u2019s Taeyang and Shinee\u2019s Taemin. He shared his experiences of working with several artists. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with BTS on several of their tracks. Their performances are very powerful and they don\u2019t need a lot of clutter around them.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve seen them rise to the top, but they\u2019ve always been consistent in their manners \u2013 kind, humble and grateful,\u201d he said. Working with Taeyang was like a dream come true for him. \u201cI\u2019ve been a huge fan of his since Big Bang\u2019s debut. On set, he was a breeze to work with. Standing on a glacier in Alaska with him was an unforgettable experience,\u201d Kim recalled. Asked if trends affect the videos, he says: \u201cOf course I need to be aware of big trends, but what\u2019s more important is to identify which of the trends fit with the artist\u2019s style.\u201d In 2014, his music videos began to receive more attention with Red Velvet\u2019s music video Happiness. The huge response to this video came as a pleasant surprise. Since Red Velvet were a new act, the record label had an idea of where they wanted to go with this video project to shape the group\u2019s direction. \u201cIf you are working with an act, you have to be extra cautious because you have to consider what you can do to take them to a different level,\u201d Kim said. Kim was originally a professional snowboarder, and even competed in South Korea\u2019s national team. He dropped out of university while majoring in physical education and has not had any formal film or fine arts education. He went from making dynamic snowboarding clips to directing K-pop music videos. In 2007, Kim founded GDW, a Seoul-based film, motion and 3D studio specialising in creating commercials, music videos and documentaries. \u201cBefore I earned recognition for making music videos, I had worked on numerous sports and fashion films, corporate PR videos and commercials,\u201d Kim said. Kim said making music videos wasn\u2019t that different from making sports videos. \u201cAs a long-time boarder, what I consider the most important when shooting is rhythm, speed and balance.\u201d Those elements, he says, create dynamic narratives filled with vigour and artistry. In contrast, he always avoids still shots and redundancy. \u201cMany K-pop music videos feature still shots of artists\u2019 faces to emphasise their good looks, but I focus on their moves because they carry energy and natural charms,\u201d Kim said. As a director, he believes it\u2019s important to remember that fans are going to watch his videos numerous times. To keep their attention and focus, a director should add a lot of depth and to pay attention to the details. \u201cIt goes beyond the props, the shooting and the editing. It needs to be multi-layered, and hopefully each time they watch it, they\u2019re able to pick up little details they hadn\u2019t noticed before,\u201d Kim said. His goals are to continue directing music videos and working with talented people. \u201cI love performance videos and dance videos, and I want to do as much as I can while maintaining high production values,\u201d Kim said. \u201cIn the future, I would love to work with foreign artists as well, like Kendrick Lamar. I love being able to influence culture the way that I was influenced and tell a story through an artist\u2019s point of view. It\u2019s a really cool thing to be a part of.\u201d ",
