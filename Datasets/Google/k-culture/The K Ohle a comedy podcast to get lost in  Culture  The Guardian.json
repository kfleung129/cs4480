    "text": "Hosted by Kurt Braunohler and with some of America\u2019s best comics making guest appearances, this multi-format podcast is bizarre, confusing and funny Kurt Braunohler has been kidnapping people for three years now. He\u2019s a comedian who takes his victims \u2026 er, guests to secret destinations and lets them loose. But kidnapping comedians is not Braunohler\u2019s only interest. He also loves pets, boats and surfing, and features them all in his multi-format podcast, the K Ohle. Why you should listen: \u201cThat\u2019s a deep question for a comedian,\u201d says Braunohler when asked why he wanted to start a podcast. \u201cYou have to look into your soul and ask \u2018Why did I begin this journey?\u2019 Truthfully, though, I started it so people could listen to me talk more.\u201d As a working comedian, Braunohler crisscrosses the country making people laugh in clubs and festivals all over America. He soon realized that a podcast would let him connect with fans around the globe outside of his standup shows and repeat plays of his album, How Do I Land? \u201cWhen I tour, I realize that there\u2019s all these people in the middle of the country who only have access to me through my podcast,\u201d said Braunohler. \u201cAnd it\u2019s nice to stay in touch with people.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to do another podcast where a comedian talks to another comedian about comedy, though. \u201cThere are so many of those,\u201d Braunohler said. \u201cI wanted to make it a little different \u2013 and maybe I made it too different.\u201d The K Ohle podcast as it now exists is not the original iteration of the show. \u201cOriginally the podcast I wanted to do was called the Boat Show and it was only me talking about boats with people,\u201d Braunohler said. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about boats, but I love talking about them.\u201d While this may sound patently ridiculous, that happens to be Braunohler\u2019s forte. This is a man who once jet-skied down the Mississippi river in a tuxedo wetsuit, drove a giant butt across country, and also hired a skywriter to write, \u201cHow do I land?\u201d in the sky over Los Angeles. In that context, launching a podcast about a subject he knew nothing about wouldn\u2019t be that strange for him. \u201cIt was going to be kind of an improvised podcast where we would pretend we were boat experts, or boatswains as we call them,\u201d Braunohler said. \u201cI realized that no one was going to like this other than me.\u201d Instead, under the guidance of Nerdist, Braunohler decided to launch a multi-format podcast that combined three different shows under the umbrella of The K Ohle. There\u2019s The Boat Show where guests like Paul Scheer, Brett Gelman and Scott Aukerman have all shown up to talk about boats. \u201cIt\u2019s so wildly unpopular,\u201d said Braunohler, laughing. \u201cBut it still brings me great joy.\u201d Then there\u2019s Pet-O-Philia, also known as The Animal Show for People Who Think Animals are Dumb, where comedians like Sara Schaefer, Jenny Slate, Chris Gethard or Braunohler\u2019s longtime comedy partner Kristen Schaal come and talk about their beloved pets. Then there\u2019s Get Lost, where Braunohler blindfolds his guest and drives them to a secret destination for some urban exploring. \u201cI think the Get Lost are my favorite,\u201d Braunohler said. \u201cIt has everything that I want in a podcast \u2013 a little danger, a little bit of history, and genuine fear.\u201d The idea for this facet of the show came from Braunohler\u2019s days running around the streets of New York City in the early 2000s as part of the Psychogeography Project. It was an immersive game/psychological experiment where Braunohler and his cohorts would rent three passenger vans, fill them with up to 45 blindfolded (willing) participants, and drive them to undisclosed locations around New York. They would then have to figure out where they were and then race each other to get home. \u201cSo I was familiar with blindfolding people and taking them places,\u201d explained Braunohler. \u201cI thought it would be a great podcast even though it goes against the idea of a podcast, in that I\u2019m taking people somewhere and we\u2019re just describing weird places.\u201d It is not a typical podcast interview, but it makes for a surprisingly fun listen, even when, occasionally, the guests get truly frightened during their investigations. \u201cRory Scoville was definitely scared at the abandoned nuclear missile silo I took him to,\u201d Braunohler said. The show\u2019s unusual format has worked, too. Over the last three years the K Ohle has welcomed a roster of guests made up of some of the brightest comedy talent in America, including Nick Kroll, Kumail Nanjiani, Paul F Tompkins, Eugene Mirman, Grace Helbig, Jonah Ray, Emily Heller and many more. He\u2019s also been known to make the show a family affair, interviewing his wife, comedian Lauren Cook, and even his dog, Zelda. From time to time Braunohler throws a new format into the mix. There are Emotional Hangs and JKs where Braunohler works solo, and Killer Rips, where he goes surfing. In short, you never know what you\u2019re going to get when you tune in to The K Ohle, but that\u2019s half the fun.
