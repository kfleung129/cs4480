    "text": "Aug. 6, the anniversary of the U.S. bombing of Hiroshima during World War II, is a date that has been ingrained in the consciousness of artist elin o\u2019Hara slavick for as long as she can remember. The daughter of activist parents, she vividly remembers attending the annual Hiroshima Day in Monument Square in her hometown of Portland, Maine, in the 1970s, listening to her parents\u2019 oratory. It wasn\u2019t until 2008 that she finally had a chance to visit the Japanese city with her family when her epidemiologist husband received a fellowship to study there. Once there, she embarked on a project to document what remains of Hiroshima and what disappeared that fateful day in 1945. The results are presented in the book \u201cAfter Hiroshima\u201d (Daylight Books). \u201cI wanted to show people what was lost,\u201d said the art professor at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, aware that her unusual method of using actual artifacts that survived the blast could cause ethical concerns. CRITICS\u2019 PICKS: What to watch, where to go, what to eat Contrasting graphic images commonly associated with the bombing, her 56 photographic works aim to show remnants in a poetic form to think about Hiroshima in a new way. She focused on objects such as a lone blue bottle, a hair comb or the countertop from one of the few remaining buildings that withstood the blast. The images include a series of photographs, cyanotypes and rubbings of bombed objects and surfaces. For the series of cyanotypes, slavick borrowed artifacts from the Hiroshima Peace Museum\u2019s 90,000-piece collection donated by families of survivors. Objects were placed on sunprint paper, exposed to the sun, then rinsed with water. Exposure is a key element in her process whether it\u2019s exposure to radiation, sun or light. The result is a white object surrounded by a cool bluish background emanating a celestial, shadowy effect. ART: Can you guess the high price? \u201cIt\u2019s not the thing itself, it\u2019s also the shadow,\u201d she noted. \u201cWhen the bomb exploded it basically incinerated people, plants, bridges, everything, leaving either black or white \u2018death\u2019 shadows.\u201d The rubbings of the floors, countertops and a bank vault door were taken from the former Imperial Bank, which was close to the hypocenter of the bomb. It remained in business until 1992, when it was converted into a cultural center where the artist held her first show of Hiroshima images in 2011. It was important for slavick to place the paper directly on the A-bomb surfaces such as the parquet floor in the bank or leaves gathered from one of the 60 trees that survived the bombing, to connect to the process tangibly.

The results resemble X-rays, internally illuminated. \u201cIt\u2019s more symbolic and conceptual,\u201d slavick noted. \u201cA way to think about this lingering trauma and the effects of radiation.\u201d Exposure is the thread running through her work, from the sun, light, radiation or history. The political artist struggles with the ethics of creating art that is aesthetically beautiful from such a horrific event. Through art she feels she can reach people in a different way. \u201cI do think beauty can be radical and subversive,\u201d said slavick, who dealt with the same dilemma with her first book, \u201cBomb After Bomb: A Violent Cartography.\u201d \u201cIn the essay for \u2018After Hiroshima,\u2019 my former professor, James Elkins writes that he doesn\u2019t know if my project is ethically sufficient but it\u2019s ethically necessary.\u201d An exhibition of slavick\u2019s Hiroshima art will be on view at the Stephen Cohen gallery in Los Angeles from Sept. 19 to Nov. 2. calendar@latimes.com ----------------------- Hiroshima anniversary events Remembering Sadoko, Hiroshima girl of \u201cThousand Paper Cranes\u201d story Through Tuesday, Japanese American Cultural & Community Center, Little Tokyo.
