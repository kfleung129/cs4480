    "text": " It has been found that Korean Air did not follow its operation manual, because the crew did not make any announcement when the airplane (KE718) had a blowout on landing at Jeju Airport on July 29. Thus, passengers had to stay on board for 25 minutes without knowing about the accident. Even a moment before getting off the airplane, they had no idea about the situation. According to Jeju Aviation Administration and Korean Air, Korean Air\u2019s KE718 (737-900) left Narita Airport, Japan and touched down at Jeju Airport at 11:57 am. The plane\u2019s front tire (nose tire) blew on a runway. Fortunately, the airplane did not break way from the runway so none of 156 people (147 passengers and nine crew members) were injured. The passengers were 63 Koreans, 75 Japanese, and nine Chinese. Korean Air moved all of the passengers and crew to the passenger terminal building by bus in 40 minutes after the outbreak of the accident. Korean Air had a towing car move the airplane as the airplane could not move on its own. The accident shut down the east-west runway of Jeju Airport for one hour and 17 minutes from 1:14 pm and canceled two flights. 17 airplanes which returned are coming back to Jeju Airport.
