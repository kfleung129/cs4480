But we didn\u2019t have any idea of how this would evolve,\u201d says 25-year-old vocalist Minhyuk, one-seventh of the Korean pop group, Monsta X. They burst onto the K-pop landscape in 2015 and have since chalked up three albums, six EPs and hundreds of millions of YouTube views and Spotify streams. Wembley Arena is precisely the big stage their sound demands. On a sweaty July evening, rappers IM and Joohoney, and vocalists Kihyun, Hyungwon, Shownu, Wonho and Minhyuk hype a London audience into a roaring mass of adrenaline with two hours of sophisticated earworms (\u201cDramarama\u201d) and EDM-laced bangers (\u201cHero\u201d), all replete with complex choreography. This is K-pop at its high-octane best \u2013 immaculate showmanship balanced by a deeply forged connection between stars and fans, pulling everyone into its embrace. Coinciding with their 19-date, five continent-spanning We Are Here tour is a recently inked deal with Epic Records. English-speaker IM, the youngest at 23 and with a sharp sense of humour, calls the signing an \u201chonour\u201d, a sizeable opportunity to ascend to bonafide global stardom. K-pop\u2019s boy and girl groups have been popular, although niche, outside of Asia since the late noughties. But as acts such as BTS and Blackpink storm into the mainstream, the Western music industry is rapidly opening up to the Korean wave, something unthinkable as little as two years ago. Contrary to widespread belief that it\u2019s a self-contained genre, K-pop is an umbrella term for an entire industry, producing everything from bubblegum pop to future bass, trop to trap. Monsta X have marked their turf with a mash-up of hip hop, elastic pop melodies and tactile R&B, such as their latest single, \u201cWho Do U Love (ft French Montana)\u201d, which, Hyungwon \u2013 tall, fine-boned, sounds as if he\u2019s battling the onset of a head cold \u2013 says \u201cis a song that doesn\u2019t care what genre it belongs to. It exists the way it is.\u201d \u201cIn terms of putting on a show, yes, that\u2019s common for all K-pop groups, but we convey a very specific message,\u201d says 24-year-old Joohoney, whose staccato rap can dart from coy to combative in a single line. \u201cWe\u2019re telling the world that no matter what, we do what we have to do. We stick to our motto and I think that appeals.\u201d Monsta X nod in unison at that. They frequently agree with each other. Having gone through the rigorous vocal, dance and stage training that all K-pop idols undertake before debuting in a group, living together for years and working incessantly to get where they are, they've become tight knit \u2013 a family. Shownu, the group\u2019s calm 27-year-old leader, is adamant that despite their familiarity, they continue to \u201clearn a lot from each other. We grow together,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is the way we are. This is the way we live.\u201d Just like family, they\u2019re also prone to ribbing each other mercilessly. Ask Monsta X\u2019s resident songwriter, Wonho, if he\u2019s inspired by his bandmates and his mouth twitches. \u201cOnly a little bit,\u201d he replies, utterly blas\u00e9, making the others smirk. He\u2019s not, Minhyuk points out dryly, \u201cIt\u2019s always by Monbebe [the name of their fanbase].\u201d Off stage, they\u2019re dressed in sneakers, tees and jeans. They drink iced Americanos: it keeps them alert through their packed schedules. Wonho (owner of one of K-pop\u2019s most envied physiques, which he maintains with daily two-hour workouts), who teasingly strips down to his trousers nightly onstage, perches solemnly in his chair. There's a distinct lack of ego and they never fail to make eye contact when speaking. They're so lowkey it's easy to address them as you would a friend you haven't seen in months. It\u2019s a 180 degree turn from the Monsta X of stage and screen, where they emanate a taut, powerful and grown-up sexiness, accentuating it with smokey eye make-up, embellished jackets, chokers and leather trousers, like a cross between M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Jim Morrison. For their 2018 single \u201cJealousy\u201d, they wore bondage-style leather harnesses under double-breasted suits. It was sensual, provocative and divisive but Monsta X have developed a proud ownership of their duality. By Adam Cheung By Jack King By Jack King Hyungwon points out that, \u201cWe\u2019re stage performers, so I like wearing something that shines from head to toe.\u201d For IM, \u201cWearing a harness is just to express our song concept. Showing the audience what we want to show is the most important thing. We\u2019re not ashamed. We\u2019ve done a lot of sexual items, like harnesses and chains. We\u2019re comfortable.\u201d Although K-pop\u2019s male groups still have predominantly female fanbases, it doesn\u2019t take much effort to find male Monsta X fans discussing them on Twitter, often with the same fervency that marks a Marvel fanboy. Kihyun sees no difficulty in attracting male fans. \u201cIt\u2019s the same way when you see a good-looking actor on screen,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can say, \u2018Wow. That\u2019s a good-looking guy.\u2019 And that\u2019s how you become a fan.\u201d K-pop might be marching into Western culture, where performative and gender-defying pop and rockstars have long been cultural icons, but male K-pop artists still receive an avalanche of hate about their race and perceived lack of masculinity. Monsta X know this is out there. They\u2019re utterly unfazed. Minhyuk raises an eyebrow: \u201cI don\u2019t think the world appreciates things in the right way, in my opinion.\u201d \u201cWhat is masculinity these days?\u201d muses IM. \u201cI think it\u2019s really hard to define it, overall. Everyone has their own meaning.\u201d But, for argument\u2019s sake, where does your own sense of masculinity come from? IM pauses for a long moment. \u201cHaving a dick,\u201d he says bluntly, sipping coffee as his bandmates\u2019 jaws drop and shocked laughter ripples around the table. It\u2019s rare to see this kind of candour in a K-pop idol. \u201cBut, you know, it\u2019s also about loving yourself, caring about yourself. That\u2019s first. And we don\u2019t think that women should be like \u2018this\u2019 and men should be like \u2018that\u2019,\u201d he adds. For Joohoney, narrow-mindedness deserves only to be ignored: \u201cPeople talk about masculinity and femininity but, at the end of the day, Monsta X is there to perform a show and we don\u2019t let that affect us,\u201d he smiles. \u201cWe do what we\u2019re good at.\u201d Follow us on Vero for exclusive music content and commentary, all the latest music lifestyle news and insider access into the GQ world, from behind-the-scenes insight to recommendations from our Editors and high-profile talent.
