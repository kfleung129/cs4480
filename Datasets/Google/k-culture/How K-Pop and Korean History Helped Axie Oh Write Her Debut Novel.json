It\u2019s not just the music, it\u2019s the fandom and the music videos and the shows where people discuss the lives of the idols,\u201d Oh told NBC News. \u201cOne of my favorite things to do when I was young was watch the performances and the dances. That actually showed me a lot of what Korean culture was like.\u201d That connection, Oh noted, was a particularly important one to her because she did not grow up hearing or speaking Korean at home except through music and Korean dramas. She incorporated a lot of what she picked up from the world of K-pop (including adding a character who is a K-pop idol) into her debut young adult (YA) novel \u201cRebel Seoul,\u201d which is scheduled to be released on Sept. 14. While the 28-year-old describes the book as \u201ca YA sci-fi adventure romance with giant robots,\u201d it also has a deep connection to her studies in Korean history and the works Oh read while doing her undergraduate degree in East Asian studies. \u201cEven though it\u2019s set in the future I use a lot of themes related to 1930s colonialism in Korea,\" she said. \"I studied manuscripts that were written after that period that were reflecting on the history of Korea and the pressure of colonialism brought into the 1960s and 1970s. So I was watching these Korean dramas [for fun] and actually studying the events in history. They were all they are all about nationalism and they are all about preserving culture and preserving history.\u201d \u201cRebel Seoul\u201d tells the story of Jaewon, a Korean teen who is alone in the world until he is conscripted into the military in the year 2199. In Jaewon\u2019s world, China, Japan, and Korea no longer exist as separate countries but as part of the Neo Council, a conglomerate made up of the former nations. 10 DAYS until REBEL SEOUL's release! Excited for my mecha & kdrama-influenced YA Sci-Fi to be out in the world! \ufe0f https://t.co/7UNRUv54WW pic.twitter.com/svVY9UixiS \u201cI read a lot [while studying Korean history] about freedom fighters trying to figure out how to return to their culture,\u201d Oh said, noting that people were forbidden from speaking in Korean during Japanese rule in the 1930s. \u201cThat really inspired me when I was writing my sci-fi novel.\u201d While Oh said she always knew she wanted to write a futuristic novel featuring Asian teens, she was worried that it would never find the right audience in the world of publishing. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t that much sci-fi YA when I was growing up, in terms of books that were set in East Asia or set in Asia at all,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any markers or any books to help influence me.\u201d Instead, she devoured books by authors like Philip Pullman and JK Rowling as a teen and did her MFA in writing for young people at Lesley University in Massachusetts. She also began attending conferences for authors. It was at a conference hosted by the American Library Association that she learned of the New Visions Award for Writers of Color, a competition sponsored by Lee and Low Books that seeks middle grade and YA novel. \u201cOne of the reasons I applied for the New Visions Award was because they had put out a short story anthology called \u2018Diverse Energies,\u2019 which is all short stories by different authors,\u201d Oh explained. It was there that Oh read \u201cBlue Skies\u201d by fellow sci-fi author Cindy Pon. \u201cIt is a YA set in Taiwan and I had never read a short [YA science fiction] story set in a different country,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I was like \u2018It can be done.\u2019\u201d Pon would go on to mentor Oh and praise \"Rebel Seoul\" in a blurb that appears on the book's cover. Experiences like that one are also why Oh has become an outspoken advocate for the need for diverse books in YA literature. \u201cI had a lot of books but not necessary ones with characters that looked like me or with direct experiences like mine either,\u201d she said. \u201cA very strong factor was even why I was able to finish \u2018Rebel Seoul\u2019 was that there was this story that I read and I loved it so much. I knew [then that \u2018Rebel Seoul\u2019] would connect with someone else.\u201d Follow NBC Asian America on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr. \u00a9\u00a02023 NBC UNIVERSAL ",
