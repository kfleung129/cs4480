With bounds of fantastic singles released this year, the following is the 20 we feel break language barriers, push conventional music boundaries and highlight the fantastic range of music the K-pop scene produced in 2013. All Best of 2013 Content | The Year in K-Pop 2013Top-Selling K-Pop Songs in U.S.\u00a0| Most Viewed K-Pop Videos in U.S.K-Pop Makes First Appearance on Year-End World Albums Artists Chart  The \u201cSupa Dupa Fly\u201d rapper brings her tongue-in-cheek flow to GD\u2019s spits and growls, even mixing two of their respective signature hits in one lyric: \u201cGet your freak on, baby / Get your cray on, baby.\u201d The song is an infectious concoction of Eastern and Western sounds, sampling vocals from the Korean traditional folk song \u201cNiliria\u201d while mixing strong hip-hop elements and electronic thump, enhanced by double reed and siren sounds.  Six years into their careers, Kara is still proving to have a few tricks up its sleeves. The same zippy synths heard in past singles like \u201cWanna\u201d and \u201cPandora\u201d are now juxtaposed with noisy, electric guitar riffs. The edgy, rock-inspired production backing the girls\u2019 coos and raps shows that a veteran girl group can still shock listeners.  Synth-pop group Glen Check\u2019s dancefloor jam is an infectious mix of scraggly electro guitar, palpitating synths and head-bopping beats with a heavy \u201980s ambience that\u2019s helped the duo thrive above its contemporaries.  The six-member boy band exploded back to the scene after a long hiatus with \u201cShadow.\u201d The lavish, piano-driven composition features highly-charged vocals, falsetto-driven chorus and sharp rapping, accompanied by goth-like music video to make it one of the more exciting summer singles.  While \u201cHush\u201d is one banging pop track, the quartet teases listeners by purring over a swelling, electro-pop production complemented by bongos, piano and acoustic guitar until the beat hits at the second verse and explodes by the chorus. Instead of giving it all away the beginning, miss A showcase a perfected art of the aural tease.  The monster rookie who landed on this year\u2019s 21 Under 21 showcased a different side of herself after a pair of throwback-inspired singles \u201c1,2,3,4\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s Over\u201d with this melancholic dance track. The 17-year-old belts \u2014 and coolly raps \u2014 over a dramatic production, comparing her alluring love to a thorny rose.  One of the most promising rookies to make an official debut this year was, hands down, the multi-talented, quirky singer Zion.T. The electro-funk track \u201cBabay,\u201d featuring hip-hop veteran and labelmate Gaeko of Dynamic Duo, is a fun, bouncy track that indicates Zion.T as a major force to look out for in 2014.  Sweeping violins, surging electro beats, knocking drum \u2018n\u2019 bass: 2PM\u2019s \u201cA.D.T.O.Y.\u201d is the type of progressive R&B track dudes like Usher would kill for.  After the girl group revamped its image with the electro-pop banger \u201cExpectation\u201d \u2014 which at times recalled the beat from Nicki Minaj\u2019s \u201cPound the Alarm\u201d \u2014 Girl\u2019s Day came back even stronger with its follow-up single. Incorporating everything from tribal beats and trumpets to hand claps and rocky guitars, \u201cFemale President\u201d is not only a composition triumph \u2014 with each chorus switching up its structure \u2014 but also vocal, with the girls belting their hearts out.   Until the tango-inflected, hip-hop track \u201cBad Girl,\u201d Bumkey had struggled to land a huge hit. Teaming up with acclaimed rapper E-Sens, Bumkey\u2019s buttery vocals mixes with E-Sens\u2019 precise rapping atop a groovy melody that has listeners snapping fingers and bopping heads immediately.  Released on New Years Day, the girl group phenom set the standard high for K-pop in 2013 with this genre-bending, tempo-changing smash. With a load of seemingly disparate aural elements \u2014 clunky electro-pop, minimal drum \u2018n\u2019 bass, soaring diva vocals, fierce rapping, drastic tempo changes, xylophones \u2014 Girls\u2019 Generation smoothes it all over with a sing-along chorus and ace, forward-thinking production.  The rap duo BAE CHI GI\u2019s 15 years of relentless hustle and hard work finally paid off this year with the group\u2019s hip-hop ballad hybrid \u201cShower Of Tears\u201d featuring female vocal wunderkind Ailee. The folky, guitar-laden track is enhanced by French artist Oliver Monoury playing the bandoneon, Ailee\u2019s gooey vocals meshing along with the duo\u2019s lilting rapping.  Renowned for pristine vocal pipes, lush productions and soul-shattering lyrics, 4men rarely disappoints. The trio\u2019s \u201cHello It\u2019s Me\u201d ballad soared into listeners\u2019 hearts while lead vocalist Shin Yong Jae\u2019s surging vocal approach reminded them of lost love.  The No. 1 overall song according to the K-Pop Hot 100 this year, Sistar19\u2019s sophomore single showcased a very different side to the duo from debut single \u201cMa Boy.\u201d Over a jazzy, saxophone accompaniment Hyorin and Bora coo their way through the melancholic track, each taking a verse to tell the story of longing for a lost lover and dealing with new realities.  After years of delving into dark subjects like depression and anger, the four-piece band brightened up with \u201cOcean of Light.\u201d An uplifting rock track with thundering drum and electronica showcasing frontman Kim Jong Wan\u2019s touching vocals demands the listener to \u201cJust breathe in and breathe out your dreams with me.\u201d   Four of five BIGBANG members had major K-pop releases this year, but the one to truly shine was Taeyang with the hard-hitting, club banger \u201cRinga Linga.\u201d His smoky vocals poured over an elaborate production of pumping synths and chest-beating thumps (courtesy of Jose E. Luna and bandmate G-Dragon) \u2014 plus the intense accompanying choreography \u2014 make the solo single one of 2013\u2019s most addicting.  After years of fans begging for new music, living K-pop legend Cho Yong Pil, at 63, delivered the unthinkable and captivated music fans of all ages with the pop-rock piece \u201cBounce.\u201d\u00a0The spritely, feel-good track was released before the launch of his epically-anticipated 19th LP, \u201cHello,\u201d and ranked as one of 2013\u2019s biggest hits.  If longtime f(x) fans were turned off by the quintet\u2019s by-the-numbers \u201cElectric Shock\u201d last year, the girls returned at their most experimental yet. Somehow, \u201cRum Pum Pum Pum\u201d blends funky guitar riffs, elements of samba, hard-hitting beats, alien-like harmonies and the Christmas classic \u201cLittle Drummer Boy\u201d into one accessible pop treat.   The longtime collaborators teamed up once again for what might be 2013\u2019s most touching \u2014 and at the same time soothing \u2014 tracks. Tiger and Bizzy\u2019s deeply-reflective raps alongside Yoon Mi Rae\u2019s inspiring chorus makes for a track that will cuts deep into one\u2019s soul, but guides the listener back to the light.   \u201cGrowl\u201d was the crown jewel in boy band EXO\u2019s fantastic 2013. While past singles like \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cWolf\u201d were based around complex concepts and busy production, \u201cGrowl\u201d used a sparse, Southern hip-hop beat that let the 12 boys\u2019 talents shine through. A blend of rap, R&B melodicism and pop hooks, the breakout single had something for all listeners. Its accompanying video focused on a straight-forward, one-take video, again allowing for EXO\u2019s talents \u2014 in this case, choreography \u2014 to shine, not detracting from over-the-top high fashion. Along with high interest from the United States \u2014 the boy band is the newest act to land among the top-selling K-pop tracks in America \u2014 \u201cGrowl\u201d solidifies EXO as the act to watch in K-pop\u2019s continuing international advancement.
