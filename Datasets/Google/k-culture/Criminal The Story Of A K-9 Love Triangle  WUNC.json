    "text": "  K-9 officers make up a vital part of the Hillsborough Police Department. \u00a0These dogs are highly trained, and human officers rely on them to track suspects and assist in peaceful arrests. But it takes a lot of trust between dogs and their handler to do this kind of work. \u00a0That complicates things when a police dog retires. \u00a0That's the subject of this week's episode of Criminal, a podcast recorded and produced in the studios of WUNC and hosted by Phoebe Judge. Many of the K-9 dogs are European-trained German Shepherds, and there's high demand for them. But they come at a steep price, around $12,000. The police department in Hillsborough, N.C., has two dogs, and their handler is Cpl. Scott Foster. \"He's absolutely devoted to how important a tool and resource these dogs can be in helping police departments,\" Judge said. These K-9s\u00a0are so highly coveted because of their keen sense of smell, which can be trained to detect all sorts of scents: Suspects, weapons, drugs. \"A lot of times what\u2019ll happen is, (suspects) will initially run a short distance and hide, and they\u2019ll see us coming, and they\u2019re like, 'How are they finding me?'\" Foster said. \"And then they\u2019ll run a little further and then they\u2019ll hide. That\u2019s when the panic sets in. What they don\u2019t realize is the more panic and adrenaline they give off, the easier they\u2019re actually making our job.\" After a K-9 locates its target, they may attack but not to cause harm. \"These dogs are highly trained to bite with the back teeth and just hold,\" Judge said. \"These police dogs, they\u2019re not trying to maul anyone. They\u2019re just trying to get the person to stop running.\"  Foster has grown close with his canine partners over the years, particularly his current dog, Vader. It's not just a work relationship either; when Foster clocks out, he takes Vader home. \"One of the most interesting things is that all of these officers, their cop cars have the name of their dog on the window, just kind of symbolizes this is their actual partner,\" Judge said. Foster has shown the relationship between K-9 dog and officer is long-lasting. His previous partner, Talon, had to be retired due to injury, but Foster has continued to caring for him. \"He\u2019s so devoted to these animals that he set up his whole entire house to house Vader and Talon with the idea that neither one of them will ever think they\u2019re getting the short shrift,\" Judge said. \"Just because Talon doesn\u2019t go to work anymore, Scott doesn't want him to think he\u2019s now not important.\" Says Foster,\u00a0\"It may be silly to a certain point that I\u2019m putting human emotions on an animal that may not feel it, but I don\u2019t want (Talon) to see Vader in equipment that he would recognize and me in a uniform he would recognize, leaving in what at one time was his car.\" To find out more, visit\u00a0thisiscriminal.com.
