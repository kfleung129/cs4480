With his fellow Pritzker Prize-winning L.A. architect, Thom Mayne, playing the self-described role of \u201combudsman\u201d and \u201cfacilitator,\u201d Frank Gehry is back in the fold for a major exhibition on Los Angeles architects that will open June 16 at the Museum of Contemporary Art. Gehryhad withdrawn about a month ago, saying he doubted it would be \u201ca scholarly, well-organized show\u201d and that he was concerned the handling of his own work would be a \u201ctrivialization.\u201d Controversy and confusion surrounding the show intensified in early May as its guest curator, Christopher Mount, said it was in financial trouble, with doubts as to whether MOCA had the money needed to cover its budgeted expenses of $614,000. In mid-May, MOCA announced the show was on, but would be delayed two weeks from its original planned opening on June 2. FULL COVERAGE: 2013 Spring arts preview \u201cA New Sculpturalism: Contemporary Architecture From Southern California,\u201d surveys the work of 37 L.A. architects over the past 25 years and will run through Sept. 16 at MOCA\u2019s Geffen Contemporary building. Instead of revisiting some of his past greatest hits, such as the 1997 Guggenheim Bilbao Museum in Spain and the celebrated Walt Disney Concert Hall that opened in 2003, Gehry said his section of the exhibition will focus on a recent work, his never-to-be-built design for the National Art Museum of China in Beijing. The design lost out in a competition to the French architect, Jean Nouvel, Gehry said, but \u201cI was kind of proud of our scheme, and I wanted to show it\u201d at MOCA. \u201cIt shows the complete way we work, it was very thorough as a building proposal, and it looked different from some of our other stuff. It relates to our perception of the sense of China and how we interpret it.\u201d CRITICS\u2019 PICKS: What to watch, where to go, what to eat and more Gehry, who won the Pritzker, architecture\u2019s top honor, in 1989, said the installation would include models, sketches, movies his firm made for the presentation and \u201ca full-scale mock-up of a piece of the wall.\u201d His return to the exhibition was first reported Friday by radio station KCRW-FM (89.9). He didn\u2019t entirely quell the controversy surrounding the show. Gehry told The Times \u2013 apparently incorrectly \u2013 that the reason he rejoined the exhibition was that MOCA director Jeffrey Deitch agreed to install Mayne as its curator in place of Mount: \u201cJeffrey Deitch came to see me a few weeks ago and asked me what it would take to change my mind, and I said `change your curator.\u2019 Thom is a good friend, and I trust him, and it\u2019ll be OK.\u201d Deitch wasn\u2019t available for comment Friday, but Mayne said that he is definitely not the show\u2019s curator \u2013 it\u2019s still Mount. PHOTOS: Arts and culture in pictures by The Times At 69, Mayne is 15 years younger than Gehry and has known him for decades. He said he felt the exhibition was too important a showcase for L.A. architects \u2013 especially ones a generation or two younger than Gehry and himself \u2013 to allow it to be sidetracked. When its difficulties surfaced, he said, he approached Deitch, offering advice and help, and started making calls in the L.A. architecture community aimed at putting the exhibition back on track. The calls included one to Gehry, asking him to reconsider his withdrawal. \u201cI\u2019ve been in Frank\u2019s jet stream my whole life,\u201d said Mayne, the 2005 Pritzker winner whose buildings include the Caltrans\u2019 District 7 headquarters in downtown L.A. \u201cI said, `Frank, this is a collective community, you want to be in the show.\u2019\u201d Mayne said he\u2019s helped with logistical matters such as putting together a team of craftspeople that\u2019s assembling the physical show, but that he had almost no curatorial input. He said that apart from \u201csuper-minor tuneups\u201d and \u201cultra-minor changes,\u201d it\u2019s \u201cthe same show\u201d that had been envisioned all along, and that \u201cChristopher Mount is the curator without question.\u201d Mount said he was \u201csort of shocked\u201d to hear that Gehry thought he\u2019d been replaced, but was happy about the star architect\u2019s return. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have him back. He\u2019s the world\u2019s most famous architect, without a doubt.\u201d \u201cA New Sculpturalism\u201d is a leading component of a series sponsored by the J. Paul Getty Trust, \u201cPacific Standard Time Presents: Modern Architecture in L.A.\u201d The primary funding is a Getty Foundation grant of $445,000. For the record, June 1, 6:30 p.m.: A previous version of this post incorrectly gave the year of Frank Gehry\u2019s Pritzker Prize as 1997.
