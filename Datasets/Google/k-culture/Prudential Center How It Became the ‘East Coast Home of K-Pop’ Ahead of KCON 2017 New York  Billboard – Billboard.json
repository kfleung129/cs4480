    "text": "How the Prudential Center in Newark became K-pop's East Coast home with the arena executives talking why K-pop is good business -- monetarily and socially. By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJeff Benjamin For the third year in a row, K-pop fans will flock to Newark\u2019s massive Prudential Center to make their annual pilgrimage\u00a0to the East Coast iteration of KCON. For all day on June 24 and 25, headliners like Highlight, CNBLUE, TWICE, GFriend and NCT 127 perform and meet fans during two days and nights of non-stop panels, workshops, fan meetings and concerts. The world\u2019s biggest K-pop and Korean-culture festival has spent six years jumping venues for its landmark event in California, but when it came time to open an East Coast stop, The Rock was eager to step up.  K-pop shows started becoming a regular experience for Prudential Center in 2011 \u2014 mind you, before PSY\u2018s \u201cGangnam Style\u201d blowup in summer of 2012\u00a0\u2014 with the arena reporting nearly 130,000 people come through their doors, grossing around $17.43 million in ticket sales, all in the name of K-pop. But as Prudential Center\u2019s executive vice president of entertainment programming Sean Saadeh explains, the appeal goes beyond money. \u201cIt\u2019s great business in a lot of different ways,\u201d he says. \u201cNot just financially, but from a branding standpoint, the social aspect and the bringing in news fans to Prudential Center as well as the city of Newark.\u201d Saadeh says diverse programming has been a cornerstone of the venue with Korean-pop concerts making that goal easy. \u201cI was actually surprised at how diverse the fanbase was,\u201d the exec adds, citing BIGBANG\u2018s two 2015 shows as his first eye-opening moment. \u201cInitially, I thought it was going to be Korean fans or a majority of Korean fans, but everyone loves this music. I love that and it continues to diversify over time.\u201d 2016 and 2017 concerts\u00a0by the likes of EXO and BTS\u00a0created some of the most fervent responses. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to see how quickly the tickets move,\u201d says vice president of entertainment programming Brian Gale. \u201cWe put EXO tickets on time at 8 p.m., which was a very weird time to do that, and within 20 minutes we were about 1,500 tickets shy of a sellout.\u201d \u201cI was blown away with the intensity of the fanbase,\u201d adds Saadeh. \u201cBTS was ridiculous. I think they sold out quicker than when Bruce Springsteen went on sale. There\u2019s such a huge demand.\u201d  The famously passionate and connected K-pop fan makes the venue not only see\u00a0gains on social media, but forces them to step up their facility\u00a0game. \u201cIf you do something well, [fans] will talk about it in the community,\u201d Gale adds, with Pru Center adamant that K-pop is their top social-media content, boasting nine of their\u00a010 most fan-engaged\u00a0pieces of content coming from Korean acts. \u201cThey talk online, they talk on blogs, they\u2019re very active. I think from a facility standpoint, it\u2019s exciting to see them talking in that market atmosphere. When things go well, it keeps you in line to do things well because they talk.\u201d That buzz \u2014 along with an outdoor plaza, private practice facility and\u00a0parking lots surrounding the building ideal for outdoor activities\u00a0\u2014\u00a0helped Prudential land the East Coast location when KCON was looking to expand. \u201cI\u00a0love that we\u2019re\u00a0involved at the very front end when these acts\u00a0get introduced to the United States,\u201d Saadeh shares. \u201cIt\u2019s the reason why We\u2019ve become this \u2018East Coast home of K-pop\u2019 which is something really embraced from the get-go and I think it\u2019s part of the reason why we\u2019ve been so successful.\u201d With a steady stream of three to four shows planned a year along with expanded space and dedication to the ongoing KCON fest \u2014 which will be seen by this year\u2019s heavier emphasis on K-food trucks and food programming taking over an adjacent parking lot \u2014 Prudential Center sees K-pop\u2019s future as reminiscent of mania over\u00a0Beatles or\u00a0Backstreet Boys. \u201cIt\u2019s such an incredible experience,\u201d Saadeh marvels. \u201cThey\u2019re lining up 24, 48 hours outside of the building and when we open the doors, the passion to get to the front of the stage, it reminds of a different era quite frankly.\u201d Daily newsletters straight to your inbox Send us a tip using our anonymous form.
