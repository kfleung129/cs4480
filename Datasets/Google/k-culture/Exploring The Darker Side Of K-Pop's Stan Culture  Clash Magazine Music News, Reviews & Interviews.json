    "text": "As the Western music world unravels with big names like R Kelly and Michael Jackson coming under fire for sex abuse scandals, a similar situation has been unfolding in the increasingly popular K-pop industry. Over the years many Korean artists \u2013 professional labelled as \u201cidols\u201d \u2013 from veteran group Super Junior\u2019s Kangin\u2019s DUIs (in 2009 and in 2016) and involvement in assault cases, to the Big Bang artist\u00a0T.O.P\u2019s marijuana controversy, and many others the list of those embroiled in scandals has been growing longer. The latest, and most horrifying, instance referred to as the \u2018Burning Sun Gate\u2019 has in essence exposed a K-pop crime cartel. A slew of adored artists \u2013 including Big Bang\u2019s Seungri, FT Island\u2019s Choi Jung Hoon, Highlight\u2019s Yong Jun-hyung and entertainer Jung Joon Young \u2013 were proven to be part of a group chat where surreptitiously filmed videos of women were shared, with some members of the chat also engaging in prostitution, and alleged sexual assault. Starting off in January 2019 with footage of a man being assaulted by guard of Burning Sun \u2013 a club of which Seungri was known as executive director \u2013 became a saga of crime and corruption in the following months. Crimes including prostitution mediation, filming and circulation of illegal hidden camera footage, drug usage, bribing the police, gambling, tax evasion and most recently sexual assault became \u2018Burning Sun Gate\u2019 which shook Korea. \u2013 \u2013 \u2013  \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 As well-known names and their disconcerting list of crimes were revealed one after another bringing attention to the dark side of supposedly \u201cinspirational\u201d public figures, fans \u2013 no matter how supportive \u2013 were expected to understand that this is much more than just the clumsy quirks of their idols. And yet many people continued to fiercely defend and support their favourite K-pop idols. This is where we should begin to consider if the \u201cidol culture\u201d that is prevalent in Korean entertainment does more harm than good. This culture is something that undeniably extends to the West as well. As R Kelly\u2019s numerous sexual abuse allegations became a talking point, the loyalty of many of fans remained unchanged. As the six-part documentary highlighting his crimes \u2013 Surviving R.Kelly- indicated that people still had hollow justifications to offer in his defence. But the difference between the defenders of R Kelly and those of K-pop artists like Seungri is that while R Kelly fans displayed nonchalance or detachment to his actions \u2013 defending him with \u201cThere are two sides to every story,\u201d \u201cWho are we to judge?\u201d and \u201cHe\u2019s been the same for years\u201d \u2013 those of Seungri and many others have remained fiercely and passionately defensive of their \u201coppa\u201d (older brother) \u2013 with beliefs that Seungri, in particular, was witch-hunted and that everything has been a plot against him. An idol is defined as a person who is greatly admired, loved, or revered. But why are people like those involved in \u2018Burning Sun Gate\u2019 awarded that title without any effort? Since the advent of the genre in the mid-90s, K-pop idols have been groomed by their management teams to have clean, near perfect images \u2013 with every visible fault, of personality or actions, glossed over as jokes. This projected perfection which includes fan-service such as artists interacting with their fans informally via social media, and indulging them in their romantic \u201cidol boyfriend\u201d fantasies, can be fun and harmless. But where do you draw the line and understand that not every action is defendable or forgivable? Speaking to a range of fans of the polished, gimmicky and increasingly popular genre, the general consensus is that putting these artists up on a pedestal is doing no one any good, as it prompts them to abuse this undying support. Musician and student Rhianne Mee, 20, says: \"Fandoms can be possessive of their idols, unable to accept when their favourites have done wrong. But in Big Bang\u2019s case, Seungri\u2019s issue is beyond opinion, it\u2019s a crime.\" \u2013 \u2013 \u2013  \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 These crimes that Rhianne mentions are unfortunately not limited to the Korean entertainment industry. News reports indicate that the crime of secret filming is rampant throughout the country with a South Korean hotel found guilty of filming 1500 guests without consent, while other stories strewn across the internet reveal that sexual abuse of women \u2013 rapes remain incredibly difficult to prosecute \u2013 is largely hushed into non-existence by mandates of Korean culture. Nottingham Trent Linguistics student Jade Shepherd, 21, believes that Seungri\u2019s issue helped shine a light on a society-wide problem. She says: \u201cIf the scandal hadn\u2019t happened the widespread issue of spy cams in the country may not have been brought to attention. But I believe the impact on the industry should be much more severe.\u201d But what could have been a positive revelation to improving attitudes in the conservative country such as Korea was flipped on its head when fans \u2013 both Korean and international \u2013 began to defend those accused of the crimes. Korean, and Asian, traditions at large have always been deeply rooted in a chase for perfection. It\u2019s these values of perfection that are often reflected in K-Pop. Long-time fan Ruqaya Malik says: \u201cK-Pop is meant to be a fantasy. Idols put on a flawless performance on stage and don\u2019t expect people to believe that\u2019s who they are in real life. But social media and variety shows that present these idols as perfect, thus making it harder for fans to reconcile or accept when they do something wrong.\u201d She adds: \u201cThe industry can definitely be something that entertains and inspires people, but marketing strategies and obsessive fans have turned it crazy and toxic.\" As each passing day shines a new light on the ugly side of pretty idols \u2013 in the last few days JYJ\u2019s Park Yoochun tested positive for methamphetamine(crystal meth) use \u2013 it becomes time to redefine \u201cidol culture\u201d and for fans to open their eyes to the fact that there may be a very dark side to the people they idolise- and that they themselves are possibly part of a much bigger problem. \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Words: Malvika Padin Join us on\u00a0Vero, as we get under the skin of global cultural happenings.
