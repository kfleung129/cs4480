Whereas official prices for the concerts in June start at HK$480, fans are being asked to pay up to HK$11,000 online Public sales of tickets for the June 2 and 3 shows do not start until April 9, but Chinese-language Hong Kong newspaper Ming Pao reported that certain credit card holders were able to buy advance tickets through a priority booking offer running from March 26 to April 6. Anticipating high demand when public sales start, holders of tickets bought in advance are believed to be cashing in via resale sites such as Viagogo and Chinese websites. The concerts at AsiaWorld-Expo, Lantau Island, will be the boy band\u2019s first solo shows in Hong Kong in 14 months. The \u201cEXO Planet 4\u201d tour comes to an end with the Hong Kong shows, having started in Seoul in November, and taken in other Asian cities such as Taipei, Osaka, Singapore, Bangkok and Manila.
