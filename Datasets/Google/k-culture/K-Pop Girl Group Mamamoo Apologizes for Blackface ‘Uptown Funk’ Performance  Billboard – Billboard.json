By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tTamar Herman Korean girl group Mamamoo apologized Saturday after a video clip aired at their concert that featured the quartet in blackface. During their concert on Friday in Seoul, Mamamoo released a parody featuring them performing Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars\u2019 \u201cUptown Funk\u201d while covered in facepaint and wearing the same outfits featured in the music video. The culturally offensive act garnered attention and gained major backlash on social media. In a statement uploaded to\u00a0their Facebook page on Saturday, Mamamoo apologized for their \u201cinsensitive actions\u201d and said \u201cthere is no excuse for what we did.\u201d Explore\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tExplore\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMamamoo\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nSee latest videos, charts and news\n\n\n\nSee latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news \u201cWe were extremely ignorant of blackface and did not understand the implications of our actions,\u201d the group wrote. \u201cWe will be taking time to understand more about our international fans to ensure this never happens again. We hope that you will help to educate us on these and other issues so that we can become better people and better artists.\u201d  The group also assured fans that they \u201clove and care so much for all people of every race, sexuality, religion and gender.\u201d The latest incident came nearly exactly a year after member Hwasa sang a cover of Beyonc\u00e9\u2018s \u201cIrreplaceable\u201d and vocalized the N-word and\u00a0only a few months after Mamamoo\u00a0re-released\u00a0the music video\u00a0for their single \u201cDecolamanie\u201d after a scene was criticized for perpetuating rape culture. The group\u00a0has seen multiple albums appear on the World Albums chart since their debut in 2015. Racism in South Korea, especially for entertainment purposes, has become a hot topic in the country. Earlier this year, popular variety show guest Sam Okyere appeared on the television show Talking Show and discussed the discrimination he faced as a Ghanan living in the country. The clip went viral and opened up a broader discussion about race in the country. The same day as Mamamoo\u2019s concert, the Korea Times published an article that explored racism in\u00a0South Korea\u2019s entertainment industry. K-pop itself is often criticized for cultural appropriation and stereotyping, particularly in reference to the African-American roots of hip-hop. Mamamoo is hardly alone in using blackface for comical purposes, as it is a trope that commonly surfaces\u00a0on Korean television and media. In 2012, a representative of BIGBANG\u2019s G-Dragon \u2014 one of K-pop\u2019s most internationally renowned stars \u2014 told SPIN that an image he posted to Instagram was \u201ctaken out of context\u201d and did not actually show the star in blackface. But, though it is common, apologies for cultural insensitivity and blackface are far and few in Korea and rarely come without international audiences clamoring for an explanation.  Read Mamamoo\u2019s full statement here: Hello, this is Mamamoo. We are extremely sorry for our insensitive actions and use of blackface in our video while portraying Bruno Mars. There is no excuse for what we did and there are not enough words to explain how regretful we are. We are heartbroken to have hurt our international K-Pop fans so deeply. We love and care so much for all people of every race, sexuality, religion, and gender. We love all our fans and are so sorry to have hurt our fans in the black community. We understand now why our actions were wrong and we never meant to do harm with our video. We were extremely ignorant of blackface and did not understand the implications of our actions. We will be taking time to understand more about our international fans to ensure this never happens again. We hope that you will help to educate us on these and other issues so that we can become better people and better artists. Thank you so much for bringing this to our attention and allowing us to right the wrongs that we have done.
