    "text": "By Celeste Kriel K-pop\u2019s first openly gay singer, MRSHLL, has released his new mixtape, Alien Issa Mixtape, which he says is dedicated to all the \u201caliens and the misfits\u201d and those on the margins of society. \u201cThese are songs I\u2019ve been working throughout the past year that didn\u2019t make it onto the Breathe EP released this past June, nor did it quite fit into the concept of my next album but I didn\u2019t want to throw them away,\u201d the Korean-American artist said. During the process of writing the new music, it became more than just a \u201cSoundCloud thing,\u201d he added, and he decided to share the six new songs on all streaming platforms as a mixtape. The title of Alien Issa Mixtape alludes to the fact that the artist does not feel fully at home in this world, especially Korean society, the birthplace of his parents. \u201cI kind of sometimes feel like I\u2019m not a part of this world and I don\u2019t fit in necessarily. While my parents are from here, I was born and raised abroad,\u201d \u201d he said. \u201cBut now being here in the land of my parents which essentially is a part of me, I\u2019ve been learning a lot about the culture and my identity as a Korean. But being raised somewhere else, sometimes I feel like I look like me but I\u2019m an alien, like a Korean impostor.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the theme I wanted to go with and I just feel like there\u2019s a lot of us out there that feel like we are outcasts or that we are kind of in the margins and don\u2019t fit in.\u201d He repeats the mantra \u201cRelax your mind, it\u2019s time to unwind\u201d on one of the songs, Breathe, also the title of his first mini-album released in June. While MRSHLL didn\u2019t hide his sexuality in the past, he had never been particularly vocal about it either. However, MRSHLL the musician and Marshall Bang, the Korean-American from Orange County, have always had a vision to inspire and help others by celebrating the things that make people unique. In helping others he felt he was helping himself. After moving to LA, working for a non-profit, then delving into hairstyling and cosmetology, MRSHLL found the courage to live his own truth out loud. \u201cI was playing this big role of being fully \u2018self-realised\u2019, but I had this secret I wasn\u2019t ready to give away so it was quite a journey of self-work, self-love and self-actualisation. It wasn\u2019t like there was an \u2018aha\u2019 moment, it was over time when I met and interacted with people from different communities, I gained inspiration from other people living out bold and loud and proud and that gave me inspiration and strength to be more of myself.\u201d His song Elevate speaks about elevating communities, individuals and ourselves. \u201cWe have it within ourselves to elevate and go on to the next level and be more than who people tell us we have to be and have the strength to be who we are meant to be,\u201d he said. MRSHLL is an advocate for Korea\u2019s LGBTQ community and hopes to create more visibility with his music. He hosts an inclusive party called \u201cPose\u201d that welcomes all genders. \u201cI hope my music or the parties I host or anything I am a part of will help people be bolder and be more courageous in who they are and that people will be able to meet and find other people in our community as well and be strengthened by each other,\u201d he said. Since moving from LA to New York and then to Seoul, there has been a MRSHLL metamorphosis. \u201cI\u2019ve been coming out of my cocoon and starting to spread my wings. Although I haven\u2019t fully spread my wings yet, I\u2019m at least starting to unfold.\u201d ",
