When New Hampshire teacher Misty Crompton learned that she had become campaign fodder for a local school board race, she says, \u201cI immediately thought of the California privilege teacher.\u201d Crompton is referring to a third-grade teacher in Cupertino, Calif., who became a right-wing-media punching bag after a lesson she\u2019d taught about white privilege went public. \u201cI thought, \u2018They\u2019re going to try to tar me with that same brush.\u2019\u201d1 \n\n\n\n\nCrompton, who has taught middle school social studies in Derry for 21 years, would seem an unlikely target for culture warriors. She hasn\u2019t even taught since August 2020, when she was awarded a paid sabbatical by the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation, a prize granted annually to an exceptional teacher in the state. But what Crompton saw as a once-in-a-career opportunity to study success stories from school districts around the country and help New Hampshire become an \u201cequity leader,\u201d conservatives viewed as a nefarious plot.2\n\u201cRight now, a Derry teacher is training to change our social studies curriculum to teach Critical Race Theory (Marxist ideology) in our schools with no community input,\u201d warned campaign postcards sent to voters in this southern New Hampshire mill town. Then a Republican state representative from Derry, Katherine Prudhomme O\u2019Brien, weighed in, complaining to school board members that Leaders for Just Schools, a program Crompton is part of, was linked to Black Lives Matter. \u201cI know a lot of people like Black Lives Matter. They don\u2019t realize it\u2019s a Marxist organization,\u201d warned O\u2019Brien, who also invoked the Cambodian genocide.3\nThis spring, New Hampshire has witnessed an extraordinarily acrimonious debate about public education. GOP lawmakers, who took control of the legislature in 2020, have prioritized controversial\u2014and deeply unpopular\u2014legislation, including a sweeping expansion of a program that provides tuition vouchers for private schools and a ban on discussing \u201cdivisive concepts,\u201d such as racism or sexism, in the public schools. Crompton, an outspoken opponent of both measures, says, \u201cI became a pawn in the culture war and in the scheme to discredit public schools.\u201d4 \nMisty Crompton, a New Hampshire middle school teacher.  \nShe isn\u2019t the only one. Fueled by the Trump-era GOP\u2019s insatiable appetite for red-meat issues\u2014and finding fertile ground in a public politically polarized by the pandemic\u2014the culture wars are raging, upending school board races, reshaping local politics, and now threatening public education itself.5\n\n\n\nPopular\n\"swipe left below to view more authors\"Swipe \u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy I Just Quit DSA\n\nWhy I Just Quit DSA\n\n\n\nMaurice Isserman \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m a Proud Jewish DSA Member.

Laats points out that a virtually identical panic emerged in the 1950s: \u201cThere\u2019s no more Soviet Union, no more [Fidel] Castro, but once again you have this fear of the government taking over that\u2019s this high-anxiety issue.\u201d7 \nCurrent Issue\n\n\n\n \nView our current issue\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in at least one respect, the current culture war convulsion differs from its antecedents, Laats says. \u201cThe big difference is Trump.

But that little bit of progress they made around equity and innovative programs resulted in a backlash that destroyed all of that little bit of progress,\u201d Rooks says.10 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore From Jennifer C.

Bills prohibiting the teaching of critical race theory and other \u201cdivisive topics\u201d have already passed in Utah, Texas, Oklahoma, and Tennessee and are under consideration in at least 15 other states. In Missouri, a proposed amendment sought to outlaw what its author describes as the \u201cerroneous and hate-filled 1619 Project.\u201d11\n\u201cIt said \u20181619 Project,\u2019 but the aim was much broader. It would affect every part of history and literature,\u201d says Jessica Piper, who teaches 11th-grade American literature in Maryville, Mo., a town of 12,000 on the Iowa border.12\nPiper would seem to be exactly the sort of teacher that legislators around the country are targeting. Her students read Clint Smith\u2019s poem \u201cHow to Make a Cardboard Box Disappear in 10 Steps,\u201d with its stark imagery of lives lost to police brutality, as part of a history lesson on racial violence. In 1931, a mob of more than 2,000 Maryville residents lynched a man named Raymond Gunn, burning him to death on top of the local schoolhouse. \u201cThere\u2019s no historical marker, so the students didn\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d Piper says. This year, for the first time since she began using the poem in class, a parent complained.13 \n\n\n\n\nPiper recently decided that this will be her last year in the classroom. She\u2019s running for the state legislature as a Democrat in a long-shot bid to unseat a Republican who, when he last faced an opponent, won by 80 points.14 \nRelated Articles \n\nFlorida\u2019s Ron DeSantis Wants to Cancel Education About Systemic Racism\n\nJohn Nichols \n\n\nRepublican Cancel Culture: State Laws to Suppress Activism\n\nDavid Cole \n\nIn Iowa, as in Missouri, lawmakers have made the culture wars the centerpiece of their legislative agenda. So far this session, legislators have sought to ban transgender student athletes, implement an ideological test for state-funded faculty, and prohibit the teaching of \u201cdivisive concepts\u201d at public schools and universities.15\n\u201cThey went with the Trump 1776 agenda,\u201d says Nick Covington, a high school social studies teacher in Ankeny, a city north of Des Moines. \u201cThey\u2019re carrying that banner, and it has a chilling effect on everything.\u201d16 \nNick Covington, an Iowa high school social studies teacher.  \nThe bitter aftermath of the presidential election has also roiled the city. Two Ankeny residents were among the participants in the January 6 Capitol attack. And voting on a school funding question in March was disrupted for hours after police found a live pipe bomb at one of the facilities being used as a polling station.17\nCovington says the deep divisions outside his classroom are increasingly affecting what happens within it. This year he has been the target of repeated complaints from a small group of parents. The trouble started in January, when Covington streamed live news reports of the Capitol riot in his European history and economics classes. A parent called the school and claimed that Covington had directed students to his personal social media account, where he\u2019d called Trump supporters Nazis, all of which Covington vehemently denies.18\nThis spring, after Covington showed a Vice News report on the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Va., as part of an AP history unit on nationalism in Europe, parents contacted the school board and the superintendent and demanded that he be sanctioned. Though he\u2019d taught the same lesson for three previous years without incident, Covington was ordered by school administrators to stop talking about current events.19\n\u201cI\u2019m basically waiting for the other shoe to drop,\u201d he says.20 \nBLM blacklash: Nationwide protests and calls for a racial justice reckoning have some legislators and school districts on high alert. (Evelyn Hockstein / The Washington Post via Getty Images) \nDeep Divide\nThe pandemic\u2019s profound disruption of public education was already upending state and local politics, as Republicans eagerly capitalized on parents\u2019 frustration over shuttered classrooms. Now the culture wars are further exacerbating this tense climate.21\nJessica Piper\u2019s small Missouri town recently saw the emergence of its first-ever PAC: Northern Missouri Citizens for Reflective Government. The group, which backed conservative candidates for local offices, put most of its energy into attacking an education professor who was running for a seat on the school board in Maryville. Ominous campaign ads depicted Jill Baker, a former schoolteacher, posed between cutouts of Joe Biden and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, spouting anti-Trump sentiments and stressing the importance of teaching social justice in elementary schools. She lost in a landslide.22\nIn Elmbrook, Wis., the Waukesha County Republican Party recently threw its weight behind James Gunsalus, a first-time school board candidate who claimed that Covid was no more serious than the flu. According to Gunsalus, Elmbrook\u2019s schools, long among the highest-ranked in Wisconsin, were in free fall as teachers embraced \u201cleftist indoctrination\u201d over academic content, teaching students that \u201call white people are racist\u201d and that \u201csome people must be censored or canceled.\u201d He lost by only 5 percent of the vote against an incumbent, coming within 600 votes of victory.23\nIn the North Texas community of Southlake, a fast-growing and rapidly diversifying city near Dallas, candidates for the school board, the city council, and mayor, backed by a PAC opposing the school district\u2019s efforts to incorporate more cultural awareness into the curriculum, all captured around 70 percent of the vote. \u201cSouthlake Says No to Woke Education,\u201d proclaimed a Wall Street Journal headline.24\n\u201cEvery single right-wing person that ran won,\u201d says Megan Walsh, who graduated from a local high school in 2017 and is a leader in the Southlake Anti-Racism Coalition, a community group whose advocacy inspired the adoption of the Cultural Competency Action Plan, which the winning candidates have pledged to eliminate. \u201cWe\u2019re back to square one.\u201d25\n\n\n\n\n\nPandemic Fallout\nMunicipal races that once turned on hyperlocal issues have been politicized and nationalized by right-wing culture warriors. But the long reach of the pandemic is at work here too. Debates over diversity plans and critical race theory are further dividing communities that were already split over the response to Covid.26 \nLindsay Love, the first Black school board member in Chandler, Ariz.  \n\u201cIt\u2019s all morphing into the same thing,\u201d says Lindsay Love, a school board member in Chandler, Ariz. The first Black board member elected there, Love has been a frequent target of conservative activists and received death threats for her position that schools should remain closed until Covid levels dropped. \u201cYou hear people comparing children being masked to slavery and referring to mask supporters as Marxists,\u201d Love says.27\n\u201cYou have lost [the] trust of parents,\u201d declared a furious father at a recent board meeting. \u201cMask mandates, forcing vaccines, canceling prom, limiting graduation, critical race theory. The list goes on. When is enough enough?\u201d28\nThe school culture wars came early to this part of Arizona. After the district adopted a new program that included training teachers on race and equity issues, conservative parents revolted, charging that the equity training \u201cmarginalizes white people.\u201d Tucker Carlson has devoted two segments to Chandler.29\n\u201cChandler is getting more diverse, and they don\u2019t like that,\u201d Love says.30\nLove worries that the culture wars could end up undermining Arizona\u2019s public schools. The state\u2019s GOP lawmakers are attempting to enact a massive expansion of the state\u2019s school voucher program\u2014even though voters overwhelmingly rejected a similar effort just two years ago. Under the proposed measure, two-thirds of students in Arizona would be eligible to use state funding to pay to attend private and religious schools. \u201cThere\u2019s this constant refrain that our schools are broken, that they\u2019re liberal indoctrination camps. It feeds into this push to get parents to opt out of the public schools,\u201d Love says.31\nArizona lawmakers recently approved their own ban on teaching controversial issues. The Unbiased Teaching Act prohibits teachers in the state\u2019s public and charter schools from talking about racism or sexism in the classroom. Teachers who disregard the ban can be fined up to $5,000.32 Crompton, who has taught middle school social studies in Derry for 21 years, would seem an unlikely target for culture warriors. She hasn\u2019t even taught since August 2020, when she was awarded a paid sabbatical by the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation, a prize granted annually to an exceptional teacher in the state. But what Crompton saw as a once-in-a-career opportunity to study success stories from school districts around the country and help New Hampshire become an \u201cequity leader,\u201d conservatives viewed as a nefarious plot.2\n\u201cRight now, a Derry teacher is training to change our social studies curriculum to teach Critical Race Theory (Marxist ideology) in our schools with no community input,\u201d warned campaign postcards sent to voters in this southern New Hampshire mill town.

They don\u2019t realize it\u2019s a Marxist organization,\u201d warned O\u2019Brien, who also invoked the Cambodian genocide.3\nThis spring, New Hampshire has witnessed an extraordinarily acrimonious debate about public education.

It feeds into this push to get parents to opt out of the public schools,\u201d Love says.31\nArizona lawmakers recently approved their own ban on teaching controversial issues. The Unbiased Teaching Act prohibits teachers in the state\u2019s public and charter schools from talking about racism or sexism in the classroom. Teachers who disregard the ban can be fined up to $5,000.32 \u201cIt\u2019s the idea of the past as a refuge,\u201d says Noliwe Rooks, a professor at Cornell University and the author of Cutting School: Privatization, Segregation, and the End of Public Education. \u201cThe message is \u2018Let\u2019s get rid of the parts and the people in public education that we don\u2019t like.\u2019\u201d She sees parallels between the current attacks on critical race theory and the collisions that resulted from the rise of Black studies in the late 1960s. \u201cStudents succeeded in forcing changes to curricula and on campus. But that little bit of progress they made around equity and innovative programs resulted in a backlash that destroyed all of that little bit of progress,\u201d Rooks says.10 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore From Jennifer C.
