But after moving to New York to attend graduate school at Columbia University, she began to wonder what might happen if the members of a K-pop band were replaced with ones who were not Korean. That thought formed the genesis of the five-member boy band EXP, short for the word \u201cexperiment,\u201d that 32-year-old Kim and two other Asian women\u2014all of them K-pop fans\u2014founded in early 2015. For them, EXP raises questions about the appropriation of culture and what it means for three Asian women to manage a K-pop band made up of performers who sing in Korean and who are white, black, and one member who is half-Japanese. But for some K-pop fans, EXP and its non-Korean band members are an affront to the K-pop community. \u201cTo many people in the world, K-pop is a new type of culture,\u201d Kim told NBC News. \u201cWe serve as something that makes people think about what K-pop is and what K-pop idol groups could be.\u201d EXP began as a thesis project for Kim, who studied sociology as an undergraduate in South Korea, during her second year in Columbia\u2019s master of fine arts program. Signing on to the \"I'm Making a Boy Band\" project soon after were Karin Kuroda, whom Kim met while pursuing her second bachelor\u2019s degree at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and Samantha Y. Shao, a Taiwanese woman who studied art management in the Netherlands. None of them had backgrounds in music. \u201cAs consumers of K-pop, becoming producers of it I think is a really important shift in terms of the fact that also we are women, and we\u2019re Asian women,\u201d Kuroda told NBC News, noting that K-pop bands have generally been created by large corporations in South Korea. RELATED: The American Talent Fueling Korean Pop Music's Fire \u201cWe\u2019re here to create music and to hopefully be appreciated, and for people to actually like our product and what we are sending out into the world.\u201d Tryouts for EXP, based in New York City, were held last November. There were three auditions in total, each drawing around 150 applicants and lasting from one to three days, Kim said. The men had to sing, dance and role play a scenario in which they spoke to reporters at a news conference after learning the band would perform at Madison Square Garden, Kim said. The applicant pool was then whittled down to between 30 and 50 hopefuls per audition. \u0160ime Ko\u0161ta, a 25 year old born and raised in Croatia, was one of the men who auditioned who received a call from Shao saying he had been chosen for the band. Ko\u0161ta told NBC News he was ecstatic. \u201cAll the components it was made out of\u2014music, dance, incredible fashion\u2014it was so visually and musically appealing to me that I really fell in love with it and definitely wanted to pursue it,\u201d he said. One of the biggest challenges for band members has been learning Korean, Ko\u0161ta said. EXP\u2019s first single released in April, \u201cLuv/Wrong,\u201d was sung mostly in English. But with practice and language lessons, which band members attend weekly, their Korean has improved, he said. EXP\u2019s second single, \u201cNolja Let's Party,\u201d strikes more of a balance between Korean and English. The group's third single, to be released in February, entitled \u201cFeel Like This\u201d is almost entirely in Korean, Ko\u0161ta said. From the very beginning, what K-pop really is and what makes K-pop Korean were among the questions that drove the project, said Kuroda, who was born in Geneva to Japanese parents and grew up in New York. Is it language? Is it the ethnic background of the band members, managers and producers? Or is it something else? \u201cWhat we mean by raising questions as artists is not just to answer them, but just to get people to start talking about something and ask them that question as well as others,\u201d Kuroda explained. And that\u2019s precisely what happened around the time \u201cLuv/Wrong\u201d came out in April. \u201cOne day we just woke up to a sea of comments, like 7,000 or 8,000, on Instagram, and everything kind of blew up,\u201d Ko\u0161ta recalled. \u201cIt was very exciting and scary too because a lot of the comments were racial and homophobic slurs that were directed toward us.\u201d https://www.instagram.com/p/-htUy6SKAZ An April 19 article posted on Koreaboo, a Korean pop culture website, made mention of the disapproving remarks K-pop fans left for EXP on social media. It also addressed another brewing controversy: that EXP was imitating the well-known K-pop group EXO, a Chinese-South Korean boy band founded in 2011 in Seoul. \u201cTo many people in the world, K-pop is a new type of culture.\" Kim dismissed those allegations. \u201cThe purpose of all this is to explore what K-pop and what K-pop fandom is,\u201d she said, \u201cand it\u2019s not about making parodies.\u201d One thing Kim and her partners have learned from the comments, she said, is that K-pop fans are very protective of K-pop culture and want to keep it Korean or, more generally, Asian. \u201cWe\u2019re still figuring out how to communicate with these commenters and people who find our actions a bit upsetting,\u201d Kim said. She added that the sheer volume of posters makes it difficult to respond one-by-one. \u201cAs we put more content out there\u2014and through that content\u2014we hope to have a more productive conversation,\u201d Kim said. So far, EXP has appeared mostly in New York City, at both music and art venues, Kim said. On Dec. 4, the band will perform in Miami during the same week of Art Basel, a modern and contemporary art fair held annually in Basel, Miami Beach, and in Hong Kong. Kim said EXP\u2019s biggest goal now is to perform in South Korea, but she added the group lacks the wherewithal to make that happen. To date, a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign in May that netted EXP $30,600 in one month\u2019s time has been the band\u2019s principal financial means, Kim said. In addition to practicing with choreographers for 15 to 25 hours a week, some of the band members also work side jobs like singing at weddings and private parties, Ko\u0161ta said. As for the naysayers who disapprove of EXP, Ko\u0161ta said he was confident they would someday have a change of heart. \u201cNot all of them have realized it yet, but slowly I think they\u2019re realizing that we\u2019re not here to offend anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to create music and to hopefully be appreciated, and for people to actually like our product and what we are sending out into the world.\u201d Follow NBC Asian America on Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr.
