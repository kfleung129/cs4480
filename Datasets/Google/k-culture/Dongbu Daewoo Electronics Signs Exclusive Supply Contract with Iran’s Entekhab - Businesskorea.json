    "text": " South Korea\u2019s home appliances company Dongbu Daewoo Electronics Corp. signed a strategic partnership with the Iran\u2019s biggest consumer electronics maker Entekhab Industrial Group last week to exclusively supply consumer goods, targeting the Iranian market. Founded in 1988, Entekhab operates 200 stores across eight major cities in Iran with 3,000 sales employees. With the latest partnership, Dongbu Daewoo Electronics will supply differentiated products, including fryer oven, classic refrigerators and wall-mounted air conditioners as well as global platform refrigerators and washing machines. In particular, it will start releasing new LED TVs from this year, targeting the Iranian TV market in earnest. Entekhab Group said it has signed the deal because Daewoo Electronics\u2019 products are high quality for their price, something that is particularly appealing to Iranian consumers who prioritize reasonable consumption. Daewoo will be fully responsible for everything from manufacturing at Iranian factories to promotion and after-sales service. Never miss another article!
