As a result, Korean brands have been trying to reach a more global audience, which has also been more challenging recently. At this year\u2019s New York Fashion Week in mid-February, the Korean government sponsored \u201cConcept Korea\u201d, promoting local designers. As part of the show, the brands Ul: Kin, Jarret and Wnderkammer all took part, showcasing an eclectic and energetic mix of K-fashion, digital art and K-pop. Jarret promoted its collection with WayV\u2019s YangYang; TXT\u2019s Yeonjun and musician Bibi were walking the runway for Ul: Kin, with Bibi even composing a dedicated track for the event. The thing brands need to watch out for is not to confuse a pretty face with brand storytelling. Brands have often promoted the star more than the star promoted the brand. Going forward, brands will need to develop meticulous online analytics to measure the return on their star investments. Because after all, only when the brand ambassador represents and tells the story of the brand, is brand equity created. If there is no logical fit and no brand storytelling, then the brand actually weakens its positioning. This is the case for all ambassadors, whether Korean or not. Opportunity and risk are closely connected. ",
