    "text": "A unit of South Korean boy band NCT has come under fire for using images of an Islamic shrine as a backdrop during a recent performance \u2013 the latest in a series of allegations of cultural and religious appropriation levelled against the K-pop group. An artistic rendition of a religious text from the shrine could also be seen on stage, raising concerns among fans of the act, both Muslim and otherwise. The creative theme of Make A Wish started attracting attention even before the song\u2019s release on October 12, when generic Middle Eastern, Indian and Arabic imagery started appearing in teaser photos. Shots from music videos and performances have shown members wearing turbans or performing what appear to be mudras, holy gestures from religions including Hinduism and Buddhism, upsetting fans who believe the band was being disrespectful to foreign cultures. Throughout the promotional period, fans regularly took to social media to criticise NCT U, and even started a series of letter-writing campaigns to express concern to the band\u2019s management. NCT is a boy band brand under South Korean company SM Entertainment, which currently features 23 members split among various groups. NCT U is a name associated with any alternate grouping of members beyond the formal make-up of the separate boy bands. The band\u2019s management failed to respond to a request for comment by the Post. ",
