    "text": "LG Electronics has\u00a0recently installed an extra-large, high-definition LED digital signage on one of Seoul\u2019s most bustling streets in Gangnam. LG\u2019s eye-catching LED digital signage solution is hard to miss -- it is 21.8 meters tall by 12 meters wide. Two strikingly vibrant 10,000 nit displays are embedded in a structure that measures an imposing 26 meters in height. The custom-built dual-sided display\u00a0is located in front of the one of the most well-known landmarks on Teheran-ro, the Grand InterContinental Seoul Parnas Hotel. Teheran-ro (\u201cro\u201d meaning \u201cstreet\u201d in Korean) is often referred to as the local version of Times Square due to the abundance of state-of-the-art screens displaying advertisements of every brand imaginable. Designated as a free outdoor advertisement zone by the government, the street acts as something of a public arena where major entertainment houses, clothing brands and corporations vie for the attention of the estimated 100,000 pedestrians who traverse its sidewalks every day of the week. LG\u2019s customized sign is a freestanding double-sided billboard, a rarity even in a city as fast to adopt new technology as Seoul. LG oversaw the entire project from start to finish, including the design and construction of the entire structure. And consistent with LG\u2019s many other display products such as TVs, monitors and laptops, LG\u2019s Gangnam LED digital signage features \u00a0extremely small bezels so that passersbys see only the stunning images displayed on the screen.
