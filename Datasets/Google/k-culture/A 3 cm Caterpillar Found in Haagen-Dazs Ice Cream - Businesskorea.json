    "text": "A shocking incidence happened to a South Korean consumer who was eating\u00a0Haagen-Dazs ice cream on July 9. Around midnight on the day, a tip was posted on a Korean internet community site saying a 3 cm caterpillar was found in Haagen-Dazs strawberry ice cream. The informant said, \u201cI heard a crunchy sound when I was eating ice cream, so I spitted it out to find a caterpillar there. I was so shocked that I threw up, but still don't feel good and has ended up having diarrhea from stress.\u201d The informant went to the hospital for nervous stomachache and afterwards she called the Haagen-Dazs main office to complain about the incident, only to hear\u00a0their inadequate response. This led her to officially report the shocking case to the Korean\u00a0Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. The ministry contacted the Haagen-Dazs manufacturing factory in France and learned\u00a0that the caterpillar in the ice cream was a beetles larva. The informant demanded that Haagen-Dazs make an official apology\u00a0through a pop-up at its website and three or more news outlets, but Haagen-Dazs CEO left for a business trip without giving an answer. Moreover, the head and deputy heads of related departments at the company contacted the informant and wanted to apologize by offering a 200,000 won (US$180) worth of gift certificate to her. \u201cI told them that I do not want\u00a0monetary compensation. It was quite a shock that they came with a 200,000\u00a0won Haagen-Dazs gift certificate,\u201d the informant said. \u201cThe reason I refused the compensation is for consumers\u2019 right to know. As a Haagen-Dazs lover, I felt betrayed to find a caterpillar in the ice cream and\u00a0their insincere attitude made me angry,\u201d she added. Both Haagen-Dazs headquarters in the US and its factory in France are reportedly viewing the incidence in Korea as a fairly serious problem and are keeping their eyes on it. US General Mills, the corporate that owns the Haagen-Dazs brand, sent out an official apology, saying, \u201cAccording to the results from our self-inspection, we judged there is a high chance that the larva was in a strawberry collected from the strawberry farm\u201d and that \u201cthis incidence is a very unusual one that is not related to food safety, but we will\u00a0do our best to raise the quality standard and provide the best product.\u201d Never miss another article!
