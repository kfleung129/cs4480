    "text": "The British comedian talks Trump, marriage equality and why he\u2019s telling golliwog jokes in his show at the Melbourne international comedy festival Stephen K Amos is back in Australia after 12 months of touring the globe and his new show, World Famous, takes aim at the nationalism and casual racism he encountered over an especially strange year. In the midst of his run at the Melbourne international comedy festival, Amos shares his thoughts on Pauline Hanson\u2019s return, the continued fight over the Racial Discrimination Act and marriage equality, the significance of a British black comedian making Australia laugh at \u2013 and re-examine \u2013 its national crises, and the chaos he leaves in his wake. Simon Miraudo: Your new show, World Famous, is all about spending a year travelling the world and performing comedy. But with everything that\u2019s gone on over the past year has the world even been in the mood for comedy? What did you find on your travels? Stephen K Amos: Ah, well that\u2019s the oxymoron, if you like, of the show, because the title in itself is a bit of an anomaly. I have indeed travelled around the world but it\u2019s the state of the world itself that is going to be the subject of the show. Some of the places you toured include England, Scotland, Greece, Germany. Do you ever wonder if global chaos is directly following your tour schedule? [Laughs] I think I do a show to leave people with humour and fun times and laughter but instead it\u2019s leaving a path of destruction. I don\u2019t think [Cyclone] Debbie\u2019s got anything on me. Your show does deal with all these things that have gone down all around the world. You\u2019ve got Brexit, Donald Trump, the rise of nationalism. In your time as a touring comedian, have you noticed the world changing? Is this a new world we\u2019re in, or is the drama just more apparent today? You know, that\u2019s a really good question. I\u2019ve noticed the world changing only in the last sort of five or six years, and I put it solely down to the advent of social media, and the fact that we can now literally hear and see other people\u2019s opinions. The fear-mongering has started. With the whole Brexit thing in the UK, nobody saw it coming. With the whole Trump thing, nobody saw it coming. But what it has revealed is that there has been a bubbling undercurrent of fear and hysteria and fake news. The whole refugee crisis dominated people\u2019s consciousness; the terrorism, that dominated the consciousness. There\u2019s an undercurrent of fear and people are tapping into that fear and it\u2019s divided the whole world. It\u2019s extraordinary. Do you find people are coming to your show as a sort of haven of sanity? To talk about these sorts of things that are very distressing, but in an amusing manner? Or do you get audiences who reject some of the things you\u2019re digging into? Well, I would like to think that the audience that comes to my show are people from different walks of life, different political persuasions, different backgrounds. There\u2019s actually no point me doing my style of comedy with a room full of people who simply agree with me. If I at least make someone think, or put a spin on something that might change their point of view, that is good. I do my show for laughs, not necessarily applause breaks, if that makes sense? You know, people sitting there going, \u201cYes, he\u2019s right. Yes! Ra-ra-ra.\u201d I want you to laugh and then I pull the rug from under your feet by making you think about quite important points. Did you get a chance to go to America over the last couple of years, as part of your tour? I\u2019ve been to America. I\u2019ve been all across Europe. And the weirdest thing about going to America and going to Europe and coming to Australia, particularly before last year anyway, was how bizarre your political culture is. I\u2019d been laughing at you all from a kind of higher ground level, if you will. And then we had the Brexit thing. Now the joke\u2019s on us. It\u2019s really, really strange to have the shoe on the other foot. But it\u2019s also quite enlightening. Your new show also looks at freedom of speech. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re aware, but in Australia at the moment, there\u2019s this ongoing debate over the Racial Discrimination Act. I am fully aware. [Laughs] [Laughs] OK, so you\u2019ve been to Australia many times, and you\u2019ve travelled to other countries. Would you say Australia has less free speech than other nations? I think the problem may be because there used to be this notion that Australia was just this melting pot, and everybody and anyone could come in. Therefore, everyone is a bit laid back and can take a joke. That whole notion of, \u201cOh, you can say what you like here.\u201d However, because of the rise of the refugee crisis and the fact that not everyone can come here, the whole mood and attitude has changed. So, you can\u2019t say anything you like anymore. Some people say it\u2019s [political correctness] gone mad. Now, we all know when PC has gone mad; you know, [censoring] Baa Baa Black Sheep, blackboard, etc. If you say \u201cPC gone mad\u201d because you can\u2019t say what you\u2019d like any more, then what is it you wanted to say that you can\u2019t say any more? And ask yourself if that\u2019s OK. It\u2019s like this casual racism \u2013 not just in Australia but in a global sense \u2013 is starting to evolve into more blatant racism; more emboldened racism. But you\u2019re in the rare profession where you get to be up close and personal with people from all over the globe. On the granular level, are people becoming more racist, do you find? More emboldened? When you have the undercurrent of fear, when you have people like Pauline Hanson being an elected politician \u2026 20 years ago she was complaining about all the Asians who are bombarding these lands. Twenty years later, it\u2019s now the Muslims who are bombarding the lands and the refugees. Will it ever end? And that kind of legitimises people going, \u201cYeah, the country is full.\u201d The country isn\u2019t full. That\u2019s a fact. And also, you need to ask yourself, \u201cWhere did you come from? Where were the protests when you and your family arrived here?\u201d These things happen in cycles and, as long as you\u2019re blaming somebody else, you\u2019re not looking at yourself. My thing is compassion. Years ago, a lot of Jewish refugees were fleeing Europe, but were being taken into various countries, which is obviously a good thing. Fast forward all these years, some of these refugees are now Muslims, but that\u2019s apparently a problem, because of a minority who are claiming atrocities around the world, some of which may not even be committed by someone with affiliation to said organisation, as you recently found out with what had happened in London [the Westminster attack in March], which at the time was claimed to have been an Isis-orchestrated event. And then, you know, we found out days later he\u2019s got no ties with Isis or they can\u2019t find any. Before we found this news out, already all over social media was speculation and abuse; that horrible picture of this woman with a hijab on and on her telephone that went viral. People were going, \u201cLook at her, offensive woman who doesn\u2019t care.\u201d All sorts of things. And it\u2019s really quite sad because communication is the key. That\u2019s what we should be doing: talking. That\u2019s probably why we invented all these social media forums but each one that gets invented gets soon taken down by stupid people talking absolute nonsense. Do you ever get homesick when these scary things happen all around the world? Do you ever wish, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be touring right now,\u201d or, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be away doing my comedy; I just want to go home and be in my safe space for a bit\u201d? Do you know what though? That\u2019s interesting, again. No, is my answer. I do a joke literally about that subject. No, because I think to have that safe space and to have that fear is falling into the exact thing we should be pulling away from. When I do my shows, people come up to me or I hear things from people after the show: \u201cMy dad\u2019s never seen you before. He thought you were really great. He was surprised to learn that you were gay.\u201d That kind of thing fills me with joy, because in my mind I like to think I\u2019ve changed someone\u2019s perception \u2013 because I\u2019m pretty sure if the person didn\u2019t bring his dad to the show, he wouldn\u2019t have chosen to go on his own. Also in the show I am tackling casual racism because I talk about things people have said to me or things I\u2019ve witnessed, and I\u2019m throwing it out there in your face. I\u2019m doing a big section on golliwogs, which came off the back of a story I heard that happened in Toowoomba. There was a Christmas display where a shop decided, under the words \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d, to feature five golliwogs. Did you hear that story? No, I hadn\u2019t heard that one. Oh, please, Google that story. It\u2019s extraordinary. I started trying [this bit] out in Adelaide and the audience would literally flinch when I mentioned the word golliwog. But because of the demographic of my audience, I was 99% sure there are people in that audience who have a golliwog or had a golliwog or don\u2019t see the connotations. So, my little section, which, first and foremost, is funny, is also quite informative, and hopefully will make people think. What keeps bringing you back to Australia, specifically? What do you get out of these Australian shows compared with other places? This is probably a hard thing to kind of stomach or put into words. Basically, the connection between the UK and Australia is very, very obvious, very apparent. Australia, in my lifetime and my parents\u2019, had a policy of making Australia white, if you will. So coming here as a British black comedian, knowing the history of this place and how the Indigenous people have been treated, historically, coming out here and doing the jokes and the subjects I tackle to the audience who are coming to my shows, as one of the few black \u2013 British or international \u2013 acts who come here is quite important to me. Almost like a sense of rebellion? I think that\u2019s a bit of a harsh word because the audiences here have been very, very good, in terms of supporting what I do. They like what I do. And, like I say, I do it for the jokes but there is also an undercurrent of stuff going through. For example in the past I\u2019ve talked about Coon cheese, I\u2019ve talked about the Chicos jelly babies, or whatever they\u2019re called. It\u2019s all done with a glint in the eye, but there\u2019s a real message going through there. Whenever you come back, are you surprised that marriage equality still isn\u2019t a thing here? I am genuinely surprised and I\u2019ll tell you why I\u2019m surprised: because there\u2019s something called the court of public opinion. When you have something like Mardi Gras, which is the biggest type of parade of its kind in the world, bar none, and not just a parade itself but a week before the parade \u2013 yet, that doesn\u2019t sway the government to think public opinion is really on the side of this? It doesn\u2019t make sense, and I don\u2019t get that some people in power are worried about the conservative right or the Christian movement. When that poor young man got punched in the head and died of a single blow, instantly they changed the lockout laws of Sydney and kind of ruined the club scene, if you will. If that can happen that quickly, just on one incident, yet they completely ignore thousands and thousands of people who are showing support for the LGBT community and for marriage equality \u2026 it just doesn\u2019t make any sense.
