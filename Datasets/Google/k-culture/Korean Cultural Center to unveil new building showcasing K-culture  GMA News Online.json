Located along Bayani Road in Taguig City, the latest site promises to let its audiences experience Korean culture with their vast amenities located in just one place. In an episode of \"Inkipop,\" KCC's PR Officer Jang Seonhi gave a tour of what fans can expect including the library, the language and culture classroom, and the cooking class area. The building will also feature a mini Korean language learning section and a K-studio, where K-Pop and traditional Korean dances will be taught. \"We wanted to show the audience that they can truly experience all parts of Korean culture through our building. This can also be the glimpse of our next exhibits at this new building,\" she said. Last March 12, an online party called \"K-nnected Forever\" welcomed 150 fans for an interactive virtual tour, where they also saw SB19 and 2NE1's Minzy perform. KCC celebrated its 10th anniversary last year. Now with a new home, they are excited to build more connections with Filipinos. \"We wanted to extend our relationship further with our Filipino friends for more than 10 years and beyond,\" Jang said. \u2014Franchesca Viernes/MGP, GMA News ",
