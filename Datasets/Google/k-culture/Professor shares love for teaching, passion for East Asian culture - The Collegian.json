    "text": "Assistant professor of history Kristin Mulready-Stone\u2019s office on the third floor of Eisenhower Hall was once an attic. Now, it is filled with general and East Asian history textbooks and East Asian art. It\u2019s hard to not want to take a book off a shelf and start flipping through it. Everything is neat, from her bookshelves to her desk with copies of her new book, \u201cMobilizing Shanghai Youth,\u201d sitting in a stack. Mulready-Stone specializes in the history of modern China. She has a passion not only for education, but also for teaching diverse material to broaden a sense of understanding about the east Asian culture. Mulready attended Tufts University for her undergraduate in Asian studies, and received her doctorate in philosophy, Chinese history at Yale University. Mulready-Stone said her  undergraduate experience was terrific. \u201cI loved being in college, and I got to just about everything I wanted to do,\u201d Mulready-Stone said. When asked how she got to K-State, Mulready-Stone simply said, \u201cYou go where the jobs are.\u201d When her husband, whom she met at Yale, was hired by K-State in 1999, they moved to Manhattan together. Shortly after moving, Mulready-Stone went back to China to finish her dissertation research. When she returned, the history department wanted to give her opportunities to teach. She also worked at the Institute for Military History as the coordinator for grants and programs where she did grant writing. Grant writing lead to her becoming the institute\u2019s assistant director. In 2008, Mulready underwent the interview process to teach full-time at K-State. \u201cI had made my own reputation by the time that happened,\u201d Mulready-Stone said. \u201cI had accomplished some things in my teaching and my grant writing before that.\u201d Mulready-Stone fell in love with East Asian culture because of experiences she had in her younger years. She went to a high school that offered many languages, including Chinese, which was offered because of the Geraldine Dodge Grant.  China had started to open up after Mao Zedong, 1st chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, died and Chinese was being pushed in her school. Although her father had encouraged her to take Chinese, she was hesitant at first. She was adamant that learning Spanish was enough and the right way to go. During her junior year of high school she took a humanities class, which introduced her to many different topics. \u201c(We) studied everything,\u201d Mulready-Stone said. \u201cHistory of the world, music of the world, literature, architecture and art.\u201d One of the units was a East Asian comparative religions study. \u201cI loved it,\u201d Mulready-Stone said. \u201cIt just grabbed me, and I thought it was fascinating to study all these religions and philosophies.\u201d Due to a scheduling conflict, she had a free period her senior year of high school at the same time Chinese was offered, and she enrolled in the class. She then only applied to colleges where courses in Chinese were offered. At Tufts University, she started over and took  the beginning Chinese language course. \u201cI started college thinking I would be a English or Spanish major, but by the end of my freshman year I was thinking about East Asian studies,\u201d Mulready-Stone said. As an East Asian studies major, Mulready-Stone studied language, history, literature and political science, with a focus on China and Japan. As an undergraduate, Mulready-Stone went to China and began her path to being a professor. Mulready-Stone\u2019s path to becoming a professor started with the 1989 Tiananmen Square uprising, which occurred during her undergraduate years. She had been studying up on Chinese-related issues and noticed that no one was aware of what was going on, and found herself explaining the situation to people repeatedly. At the end of her senior year, her professor advised her to go to graduate school. \u201cA combination of knowing I could do it and having the encouragement from a very influential professor, and having a strong belief that China\u2019s emergence was important for people to study and learn this at the most basic level,\u201d Mulready-Stone said. Her colleague, Charles Sanders, associate professor of history, spoke of Mulready-Stone\u2019s skills as a professor. \u201cProfessor Mulready-Stone is a marvelous colleague, a truly exceptional professor,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cShe works hard to create and deliver outstanding coursework, and she spares no effort to assist her students in every manner possible.\u201d Mulready-Stone said the thing she\u2019s most passionate about in her professional life is \u201cabsolutely the teaching.\u201d Even with her book out, she said that teaching is her first love, professionally. \u201cMulready imparts with her lectures not only the experiences of figures in Asian history, but the mores and events that shaped their principle decisions,\u201d Garrett Parkins, senior in mechanical engineering, said. \u201cIn addition to her time well-spent in the classroom, she has also been willing to meet with me on several occasions to further discuss certain facets of East Asian study.  On one occasion, she helped me lend context  to several photographs taken by a relative of mine who had served in China as part of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet immediately preceding World War II.\u201d In her personal life, her family and children come first \u2013 but Mulready-Stone is also passionate about the violin, which she has been playing for 36 years. She said she is also interested in cooking, gardening and landscaping. \u201cIt\u2019s part of who I am,\u201d Mulready-Stone said. \u201cMy family is my love and my life, and my music is my passion.\u201d Her book \u201cMobilizing Shanghai Youth\u201d is a revised and published version of her dissertation over Shanghai youth and Chinese youth in general \u2013 not to be mistaken with student protests that coincide with Chinese youth. \u201cThere are so many books published on student protests in China,\u201d Mulready-Stone said. \u201cSo I thought, \u2018There were books on student protests, but no books on youth.'\u201d Her adviser, historian and Yale University professor Jonathan D. Spence, is one of the biggest names in Chinese history in the western world. Spence was intrigued and advised her to pursue the topic, which he said could be published. The practices Spence instilled in Mulready-Stone, both directly and indirectly, about how to be a teacher, have an impact on her teaching today. \u201cShe\u2019s an amazing teacher,\u201d Sam Easley, junior in history, said. \u201cI always felt like I could go and get advice from her and she actually cared about my grade and understanding of her course.\u201d Mulready-Stone has a broad expertise in many areas, and her passion for East Asian studies has earned her the love and admiration of her students, colleagues and the K-State family.
