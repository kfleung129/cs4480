Top acts have cancelled concerts, amusement parks have shuttered and cinemas \u2013 a beloved past-time in China \u2013 have seen their numbers dwindle.

But elsewhere too authorities have recommended that people wear masks in public and avoid crowded places. Restaurants, bars and shops have also remained closed longer than usual after the Chinese New Year holiday \u2013 which began on January 25 \u2013 amid fears the virus could spread easily. Empty stages, dark screens The public health emergency has led theaters and local stars to pull the plug on upcoming shows. The National Center for Performing Arts, Beijing's foremost opera and concert hall, has cancelled all performances for the month of February. Hong Kong star Andy Lau scrapped 12 concerts in Hong Kong in February, as well as dates in Wuhan in April, while fellow Cantopop singer Leon Lai postponed shows over the weekend in Macao. Cinemas in the world's second largest movie market have also been badly hit, with studios scrapping the release of seven Chinese movies that had been planned for the holiday and thousands of cinemas reportedly shutting in the wake of the outbreak. Box-office results for January 27 to February 2 showed just over 164,000 tickets were sold nationwide for the top 10 films. That compared to almost 5.2 million the previous week \u2013 when stricter health measures began being implemented \u2013 and represented a mere fraction of the 130.7 million cinema entries recorded in the week following Chinese New Year last year. Movie showings also dropped to about 14,200 from the usual six-digit figures.

K-pop band Winner cancelled a February 8 concert in Singapore, where there have been 18 confirmed cases of coronavirus, while other South Korean acts like GOT7, Taeyeon and NCT Dream have postponed shows in Singapore, Bangkok and Macao over the next month. A total of 22 countries, besides China, have reported cases of coronavirus, including Japan, South Korea, Thailand and the U.S. At risk The Hong Kong Arts Festival, which the Boston Symphony Orchestra was due to open, is now struggling under the weight of cancellations. Up to a sixth of performances planned during the month-long event starting on February 13 \u2013 including London dance company Sadler's Wells and Bristol's Old Vic theatre \u2013 have already been lost, according to organizers. This was due to performance venues being shut by local authorities as a precaution against a further spread of the virus. So far, many events scheduled for February have been cancelled, but with experts warning the outbreak has yet to peak, the arts and culture calendar for the coming months could be further thrown into disarray, in China and around Asia.
