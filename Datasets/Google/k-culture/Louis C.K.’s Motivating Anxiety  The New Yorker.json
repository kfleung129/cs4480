He has acquired a lot of new fans in the past few years, but it\u2019s hard to imagine that \u201cTomorrow Night\u201d\u2014an avant-garde black-and-white film C.K. wrote and directed in 1997 and distributed last week\u2014is what they want from him. In interviews publicizing its release, he called it \u201ca relic,\u201d \u201cpretty weird,\u201d and \u201chard to watch.\u201d He told David Letterman, \u201cIt\u2019s not for everybody. That would be the tag line: \u2018It\u2019s not for everybody.\u2019\u00a0\u201d The film offers a few pleasures: Steve Carell\u2019s trying-to-suppress-a-laugh face, which is the best in the business; J. B. Smoove\u2019s charisma and Wanda Sykes\u2019s disdain, both of which would later become integral to \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d; Rick Shapiro wearing terrible drag; a cartoonish seductress named Lola Vagina. (C.K. has always gotten a lot of mileage out of the word \u201cvagina.\u201d) But, on the whole, it is ponderous, rarely funny, and, indeed, hard to watch. This seems to be part of the point. Louis C.K. grew up in Newton, an affluent suburb of Boston. His father was a Harvard-trained economist. As a teen-ager, C.K. worked at a photo-developing store and a public-access TV station, where he learned the technical process of filmmaking. His admissions interview with N.Y.U.\u2019s film school seemed to go well; but, in a fit of Joycean paralysis, he left the application blank. \u201cI couldn\u2019t fill out the thing,\u201d C.K. later told the writer Jonah Weiner. \u201cIt made me want to vomit.\u201d Instead, he took a series of gruelling jobs\u2014as an auto mechanic, a cook at a KFC, and, eventually, a standup comic, which offered less job security but also, as it turned out, more opportunities for career advancement. It is difficult to bend C.K.\u2019s biography into a stay-in-school parable; he has done quite well without an advanced degree. But his life choices left him with a chip on his shoulder. In his recent HBO special, C.K. said, \u201cA fifty-five-year-old garbage man is a million times smarter than a twenty-eight-year-old with three Ph.D.s. Especially smarter than him, because this idiot has been thinking about three things for, like, fifteen years.\u201d This is C.K.\u2019s rebuke of his father, with whom he has a troubled relationship. It is also self-justification: I may not have studied Hegel and Uta Hagen, C.K. is saying, but I have slept in musty motels in fifty states, and I have crashed a motorcycle, and I once found a computer on the street and reassembled it by hand, and that makes me a more interesting artist. And this is C.K.\u2019s motivating anxiety\u2014the most conventional of anxieties, but no less powerful for being a clich\u00e9: his desire to be recognized, despite a thin C.V., as an artist. This is the common plight of the comedian with ambitions beyond comedy. It took Woody Allen decades to be perceived as a director rather than as the guy who did the bit about the moose. In Tad Friend\u2019s Profile of Ben Stiller, Robert Downey, Jr., says, \u201cEveryone associates Ben with clowning, when he actually has the ability to control tone and story and look to achieve something masterful.\u201d C.K., tired of being associated solely with comedy, is eager to show that he can also make jarring art-house films, whether or not those films are \u201cmasterful.\u201d \u201cLouie,\u201d C.K.\u2019s experimental sitcom, will finally return to FX in May. His decision to release his juvenilia now, of all times, could be interpreted as a warning that the fourth season is going to be the strangest one yet. Or perhaps it is simply the latest push in C.K.\u2019s campaign to be perceived as an auteur. \u201cTomorrow Night\u201d might be bad art, but it would be difficult to deny that it is art.
