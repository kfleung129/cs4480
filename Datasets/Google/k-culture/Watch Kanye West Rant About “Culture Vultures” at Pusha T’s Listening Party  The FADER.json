    "text": "Kanye West has been in New York this week, taking in Hood By Air and taunting Ray J on Fallon. Last night, he held court at a listening event for Pusha T's new album, My Name is My Name (October 8th, Def Jam), held at Industria Superstudio in Manhattan's Meatpacking District. A little \"gone off that Goose,\" he delivered the above introduction speech, captured by Miss Info. (The format\u2014bare art space, candid intro, resembled Kanye's own June listening party for Yeezus.) As he defended his decision to \"stand by\" Pusha and attacked \"culture vultures\" and \"corporations,\" a woman yelled, Kanye, keep going baby! Indeed. Read a transcript of Ye's speech, via Miss Info: Aye yo this Yeezy right now speaking to y\u2019all. This the heart of the muthaf**king city, act y\u2019all ain\u2019t have that muthaf**king Clipse album and shit.
