    "text": "Zhou Jieqiong, a Chinese member of K-pop girl band Pristin who is also known by her Korean name Kyulkyung, has denied rumours that she has been dating Wang Sicong, the only son of Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin. A spokesperson for the group\u2019s agency, Pledis Entertainment, said the company might take legal action if the speculation continued. Her Chinese agency, XCSS Entertainment, added: \u201cThe rumour is far from the truth and we demand that the rumormongers delete their posts or they will face legal action.\u201d The rumours started when users of Chinese social networks, including Sina Weibo, on Sunday started claiming that Zhou had gone on a trip to Japan with Wang. Wang, 31, founder of the entertainment company Banana Culture, is the only son of Wang Jianlin, chairman of China\u2019s largest real estate developer, Dalian Wanda Group. Zhou, 21, shot to fame after appearing in Mnet\u2019s survival reality show Produce 101 in 2016 and joined 11-piece project girl group I.O.I, composed of the 11 best performers from the contest. In 2017, after I.O.I was disbanded, she made her debut as a member of Pristin, and has been forging a singing career in South Korea and China since. ",
