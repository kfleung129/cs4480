    "text": "K-pop star G-Dragon has sparked controversy with a message of \"support\" for murdered teenager Trayvon Martin, posing for a photo in black face paint. G-Dragon is the leader of Big Bang, a South Korean boy band whose YouTube videos have amassed more than 175m views. Earlier this week, he followed the precedent set by artists like Frank Ocean, Diddy and Swizz Beatz, posting a photograph of himself in an outfit similar to what Martin was wearing when he was shot by George Zimmerman. Most noteably, however, is that G-Dragon, who is east Asian, has rubbed black paint over his face. The 24-year-old has not responded to any criticism of his photo, tweeting instead about his label's new releases. While G-Dragon's fans argued in his Instagram comments, \"liking\" the photo 101,000 times, Spin called the move \"cringeworthy\" and the LA Times branded it \"unfathomably offensive\". Still, G-Dragon won't be able to continue dodging this controversy. Later this month, the boy-band idol is due to appear at KCon, a Korean pop convention in Los Angeles, where G-Dragon was thought to be hoping to woo America as he preps his new record. Big Bang, like some other Korean groups, have a history of African-American provocation. In a 2008 promo video, G-Dragon and another member dressed up as Michael Jackson and Andr\u00e9 3000, preening in dark makeup. The group has also performed in red \"gang-banger\" costumes, throwing gang signs during a TV appearance. Trayvon Martin was just 17 when he was gunned down in Sanford, Florida. Zimmerman, a member of the neighbourhood watch, claimed that he shot the teenager out of self-defence. He was acquitted on all charges last month. ",
