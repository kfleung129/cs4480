BTS, the Korean boy band that beat out Justin Bieber\u00a0for the top social artist award at this year\u2019s Billboard Music Awards, are hardly any different, and the septet has always thanked their fiercely passionate fan ARMY for its support. Becoming the most prominent Korean musical act in the U.S market since Psy, the K-pop group is undeniably the It boy band of 2017\u00a0and it\u2019s all due to the fervor of their fans.

Her\u2019s \u201cPied Piper\u201d is BTS\u2019 most subversive song of their career, thanks to\u00a0its takedown of the very fan culture that has helped the act thrive. A take on K-pop\u2019s rampant and highly profitable fan culture,\u00a0\u201cPied Piper,\u201d is BTS doing what they do best: addressing a societal problem through their jaunty music. In this case, the obsessive nature of fans, originally derived from \u201cfanatics.\u201d In line with the band\u2019s career-long focus\u00a0on urging their youthful audience to pursue\u00a0its own dreams, the boy band\u2019s mellow nu-disco-imbued track serves as a playful reminder to ARMY that a boy band isn\u2019t life\u2019s be-all and end-all. In an industry dependent on the taste and affections of its audience, BTS\u2019 frank approach to the dangers and realities of the intense dedication from fans\u00a0and the band\u2019s role as a distraction in those people\u2019s lives, is as contradictory as the group has ever been towards its place in pop music. \u201cNow stop watching and study/ Your parents and bosses hate me,\u201d says Rap Monster in the first verse, referring to the time that fans spend absorbing BTS related content and how it distracts from their daily lives. \u201cI know you don\u2019t decide what you like/ stop [and] interpret the music videos later.\u201d  Filled with lyrical tough love, warm affection is audible through the soft melody and the lighthearted delivery of the raps, turning the song away from being a bitter clap back and into a guiding ode from BTS to their fans, overflowing with paternal tenderness. Penned by three members of the group \u2014 Rap Monster, Suga, and J-Hope \u2014\u00a0their company\u2019s CEO \u201cHitman\u201d Bang\u00a0and several other regular collaborators, the lyrics are rife with nods to the German legend of the titular Pied Piper who led the children of Hamelin away from their parents forever as BTS poise themselves as an alluring danger that is \u201ctaking over you.\u201d \u201cFollow the sound of the pipe/ Follow this song/ It\u2019s a little bit dangerous but I\u2019m so sweet\u201d sings the band during the chorus. \u201cI came to save you, I came to ruin you.\u201d The track similarly refers to the Biblical tale of the Garden of Eden, with the band depicting\u00a0themselves both as paradise and as the fruity temptation that led Adam and Eve away from the straight and narrow.  The literary references are nothing new for BTS. Fans have discerned references to works by the likes of Herman Hesse and Haruki Murakami in the band\u2019s past music videos and songs. But the message of \u201cPied Piper,\u201d with the group positioning itself as a danger to its fans, is unlike anything that the boy band\u00a0and few other K-pop acts,\u00a0have ever done before. While there are songs that address the potential for dangerous obsession among fans \u2014\u00a0Epik High\u2019s \u201cFan\u201d and EXID\u2019s \u201cAh Yeah\u201d come to mind \u2014 BTS is unique for both blithely taunting\u00a0their fans for their intensity while simultaneously claiming accountability for making them that way. While hardly the only tongue-in-cheek track on the album \u2014 the Seo Taiji-emulating \u201dMic Drop\u201d is a swag track playing up BTS\u2019 rise to the top while \u201cGo Go\u201d is a reggae-trap hybrid that uses popular Korean slang to tell the listeners to \u201cstop worrying and just go\u201d \u2014 the blatant approach of \u201cPied Piper\u201d to criticize the very space within which the band thrives is precisely what makes them so beloved by fans around the globe.
