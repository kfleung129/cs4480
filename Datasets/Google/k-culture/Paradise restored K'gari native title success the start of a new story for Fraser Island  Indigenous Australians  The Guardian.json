The resolution of the title claim at a beachside hearing on Friday is a significant step, but convincing the wider public and overseas tourists, is a whole new challenge The Butchalla people who thrived on its shores for at least 5,000 years call the place K\u2019gari. Literally, \u201cparadise\u201d. Almost everyone else knows the island by the surname of a shipwrecked Scottish woman, Eliza Fraser, whose tales of \u201ccaptivity\u201d by the Butchalla in the 1830s spread throughout the colony in inverse proportion to their reliability. But Fraser Island\u2019s original appellation is on the way to being formally restored, with a native title claim by the Butchalla resolved in a beachside hearing on Friday by a federal court judge, Berna Collier. This is likely to lead to the island becoming the latest in a series of Australian landmarks whose ancient names have been hoisted in modern times alongside their colonial ones. Just how long it might take for Fraser Island to become K\u2019gari in law \u2013 let alone in the imaginations of all Australians as well as the many foreigners drawn to it like a magnet each year \u2013 is moot. Recent history has shown that the renaming of famous Australian places \u2013 such as Ayers Rock to Uluru \u2013 can be slow to gain purchase, especially overseas. But for Bronwyn De Satge of the Wondunna, one of six clans of the Butchalla that have spent the past two decades fighting for native title, the name can wait, for now at least. \u201cThis is what we\u2019re hoping to be able to achieve down the track. There is a general consensus among the Butchalla people that that would be the preferred name: K\u2019gari,\u201d she says. The Butchalla\u2019s claim to K\u2019gari was endorsed days before the 2012 state election, in one of the final acts of the outgoing Labor state government of Anna Bligh. The long battle for recognition was ignited by luminary elders such as the late Aunty Olga Miller. De Satge says it is a day of \u201cgreat significance\u201d for the Butchalla, leaving her \u201cabsolutely overjoyed but tinged with sadness\u201d that Miller and others are not there to see it. Some 400 Butchalla people are expected to bear witness to a modern ceremony to formally recognise the hold of traditional law and lore over a glittering, World Heritage-listed jewel in the natural Australian landscape. A formal pact will uphold their descendants\u2019 right to hunt, camp, build campfires and temporary shelters, conduct birth and initiation rites, bury their dead and maintain places of cultural significance across 1,640 sq km of sand dunes, rainforest and freshwater lakes. The natural bounties of the world\u2019s largest sand island helped make it Australia\u2019s most densely populated area outside the Gulf of Carpentaria before the British invasion, according to the late anthropologist Norman Tindale. \u201cSuch densities seem possible chiefly when fish and reef products are freely available,\u201d he wrote in his 1974 book Aboriginal Tribes of Australia. James Bracefell, one of the early \u201cbundas\u201d or ex-convicts to live among the Butchalla, told before his death in 1842 of seeing thousands of people gather to watch ceremonial combat on the beach. Within 50 years of colonial land grabs, massacres by police and internment in government- and church-run concentration camps, the Butchalla\u2019s numbers had dwindled from more than 2,000 to 117. The survivors\u2019 final forced exile to north Queensland in 1904 by the decree of their Anglican \u201cprotectors\u201d was \u201cone of the blackest pages in the history of the British empire\u201d, wrote one angry correspondent to the Maryborough Chronicle. Ironically, a key driver for the Butchalla\u2019s demise, according to historians, was the story told by the very Eliza Fraser after whom the island came to be named. She claimed mistreatment at the hands of local people after surviving the wreck of her husband\u2019s alcohol-laden ship on a nearby reef in 1836. The spread of those stories \u2013 though they were contradicted by contemporaneous accounts from fellow survivors \u2013 helped seal both the island\u2019s English name and the fate of its traditional owners. The restoration of native title 110 years after banishment is more than a symbolic salve for the modern Butchalla. Queensland South Native Title Services, which helped propel the claim, notes it also presents economic opportunities \u201cthrough eco-tourism and related business development supply chains\u201d. The island, after the eviction of loggers allowing the regeneration of rainforest and the denial of miners eyeing silica projects in the 1970s, provided one of Queensland\u2019s first \u201ceco-tourism\u201d destinations. Daniel Gschwind, the chief executive of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council, says it\u2019s easy for locals to forget the special nature of the island\u2019s popular resorts, which offers World Heritage-listed wilderness \u201cliterally at your room\u2019s front door\u201d. But the resorts and the island more broadly generate \u201chuge appeal\u201d to overseas visitors lured by the prospect of \u201csand dunes, the freshwater lake swimming, the driving on the beach, the camping, the wildlife, the dugongs to the south, the whales on the ocean side\u201d. \u201cWe sometimes become blase about this but you have magnificent fauna and flora right on your room\u2019s doorstep: birds, wallabies, dingos, very close and very real,\u201d Gschwind says. \u201cThe freshwater lakes, the sand island, the fact there\u2019s such a prolific rainforest on a sand island, its post-colonialisation history of logging being re-converted to a pristine environment; there\u2019s a very interesting history attached to this and it\u2019s certainly highly recognised as one of the must-do things on many backpackers\u2019 list.\u201d So what will the likely name change mean for the island? For all its ignominious origins, the name Fraser Island is certainly a \u201cbrand\u201d, according to Gschwind, and one that resonates strongly overseas. \u201cParticularly in the European market, we have many visitors, it\u2019s remarkable, the first thing they say is: \u2018We\u2019re doing Brisbane, Fraser island and the Great Barrier Reef. In Queensland that\u2019s what we do\u2019,\u201d he says. Sooner or later, it\u2019s probably going to be K\u2019gari. However, aside from the minor challenge of pronunciation \u2013 the \u201ck\u201d in K\u2019gari is silent, and the \u201cr\u201d sounded with a slight roll of the tongue \u2013 recent history has shown that colonial names die hard. Despite the \u201cdual naming\u201d of Ayers Rock as Uluru 21 years ago, the latter is still likely to invoke mystified looks in the UK, for example. Gschwind says there are signs this is changing. \u201cIncreasingly, yes, [Uluru] does appear in travel guides, in tour offerings, the two names do appear and sometimes people ask, sometimes people need to be informed,\u201d he says. But for practicality\u2019s sake, both names will continue to be used in tandem on K\u2019gari, Gschwind says. \u201cI think it\u2019s certainly possible to run with two types of names \u2026 like in the Uluru/Ayers Rock scenario, both terms still appear,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not an unusual thing for names to change, not just in Australia but around the world: look at cities like Istanbul, which has changed names many times. \u201cSo it\u2019s not unusual and I think as long as it\u2019s handled with some sensitivity and some common sense, that we make sure people understand it\u2019s the same place, it doesn\u2019t present a problem.\u201d De Satge agrees. \u201cWhen there\u2019s talk around confusion, I say, well, no, all our overseas visitors that visit regional areas in Australia know that Uluru is Ayers Rock, they know that Boodjamulla is Lawn Hill national park,\u201d she says. After the marathon effort of winning native title, having K\u2019gari formally gazetted as the name alongside Fraser Island seems some way off for the Butchalla. De Satge says it\u2019s \u201cearly days yet but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re looking to be working on \u2026 after negotiations and when the time is right, because it is a long process\u201d. \u201cI believe it\u2019s going to be quite lengthy but I don\u2019t I think it would hurt to say, this is what the Butchalla would like to see,\u201d she says. Poetic justice alone would make it so, long before the ink dries on any government papers. ",
