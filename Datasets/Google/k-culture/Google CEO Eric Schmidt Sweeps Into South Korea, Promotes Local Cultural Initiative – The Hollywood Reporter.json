By \n\n\tLee Hyo-won SEOUL \u2013 Google CEO Eric Schmidt\u00a0touched down in South Korea this week. The tech exec was in Seoul to announce that the Internet giant plans to actively promote the Korean alphabet,\u00a0Hangul, amid the rising popularity of K-pop around the world. Google will fund and design education facilities for the Hangul Museum that is slated to open in Seoul next year, Schmidt said during a joint press meeting with the South Korean culture ministry. The CEO did not specify the amount of financial support, but he said the company plans to develop web tools for learning the alphabet online.

This is just the beginning of what I hope will be a larger partnership between our two organizations,\u201d said Culture Minister Yoo Jin-ryong. STORY:\u00a0Google Chairman Eric Schmidt Calls on North Korea to Drop Web Barriers The collaboration is an extension of a 2011 deal to promote Korean music and films online, and Google plans to expand the coverage by introducing local traditional clothing (\u201chanbok\u201d) and architecture (\u201chanok\u201d) via Google Cultural Institute. As part of the former deal, several concerts including performances by Psy were broadcast live on YouTube\u2019s K-pop channel. \u201cToday, K-pop is everywhere, and even I had to learn how to dance \u2018Gangnam Style,'\u201d Schmidt said, adding nearly 90 percent of the views tallied on K-pop videos posted on YouTube are from outside Korea.  Old Korean films provided by the Korean Film Archive were screened on YouTube\u2019s Korean film channel.\u00a0Since opening in May 2012, the channel attracts about 2,700 views per day by users in 160 countries and 70 percent of users are from outside of the country. Since May this year, the National Museum of Korea and Korea Database Agency have also provided images for Google Art Project, a cyber exhibition space for artworks and cultural relics from all over the world.
