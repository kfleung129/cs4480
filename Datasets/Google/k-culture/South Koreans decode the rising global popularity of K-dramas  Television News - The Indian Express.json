    "text": "In the young adult Korean show Record of Youth, when an aspiring actor named Sa Hye-jun asked his girlfriend Ahn Jeong-ha, a make-up artist, the permission to kiss her, the minds of many fans were blown. The male protagonist, played by Park Bo-gum, had asked for consent from the female lead, essayed by Park So-dam, star of the multiple Oscar-winning film Parasite. \u201cPermission? In a K-drama?? I have tears of joy for K-dramas evolving so much,\u201d noted a fan on the YouTube video of the scene. The high-school-ish yet toxic narrative of the opinionated girl falling for the bad boy with a heart of gold, like in the popular Boys Over Flowers, has given way to K-dramas like Run, that showed the romance between a retired athlete and his interpreter, and Hot Stove League where there is no romance between the lead protagonists. K-content has gone big across the globe in recent years, including in India, and Koreans believe it has a lot to do with the ability of the country to offer variety, track trends in the global market and revisit stereotypes. Visual effects artist Hayoung Jo said she tunes into K-dramas once or twice a year to \u201ccatch up with the trends and watch the most highlighted shows\u201d. Jo, who moved from Siheung-si city, Geonggi-do province in South Korea to Toronto around seven years ago, likes these dramas because of the \u201ccultural background\u201d. \u201cI feel more attached to the Korean culture than western culture and that makes me easily resonate with the characters in the drama scenes,\u201d she added. According to Jo, K-dramas are undergoing some \u201cgood changes\u201d. \u201cFor example, there was a prevailing idea that women should get married before their 30s in order to raise their kids, but now the female characters in K-dramas are mostly over 30 and more career-oriented compared to the woman in the \u201990s-\u201900s, which is reflecting the idea of gender equality in Korean society,\u201d the VFX artist, who has worked on the hit Disney Plus series The Mandalorian, said. K-drama lovers agree that there are certain tropes that have been done to death in the shows and one sub-genre that needs to go away is the \u2018Cinderella\u2019 story. Many hit series including Secret Garden, starring Ha Ji-won and Hyun Bin, and Coffee Prince, featuring Gong Yoo and Yoon Eun-hye, have used the fairytale as the outline in the past. \u201cI am glad that K-dramas are trying new things other than Cinderella stories; they are too lame,\u201d Jo added. Min Kim, a Toronto-based VFX artist who hails from Busan, said the usual 12-or 16-episode format makes for a crisp plot. \u201cWe can watch two episodes weekly as they drop. It is relaxing to watch a K-drama after work with my family. (The limited series format) makes the storyline quite intense,\u201d the VFX artist, who has worked on the survival action drama Greenland and Amazon\u2019s hit superhero series The Boys, said. Ga-yeon Kim, who hails from Seoul\u2019s Gangnam district, said she was fed up with the strong female character stereotype in K-dramas where the woman may appear \u201cheadstrong and outspoken\u201d but the show would use these personality traits to eventually fuel a romance. \u201cI felt that K-dramas have rewarded females who are easily swayed and have punished or labelled the character as a bad person if they were confident in what is right for them. I think K-dramas should celebrate, humanise, and diversify the types of women by championing their success even if it exceeds the success of male characters without villainising them,\u201d the Toronto-based elementary public school teacher told PTI. She, however, had a change of heart after her mother told her that there are \u201cimprovements\u201d in the new dramas, such as It\u2019s Ok To Not Be Okay and Kill Me Heal Me, shows that dealt with mental health issues and childhood trauma. \u201cI find this to be great news because there are so many issues in Korea and around the world that need to be addressed such as mental health, equal rights, poverty, and etc.\u201d With all things Korean \u2014 drama, cinema, music, beauty products, and food \u2014 going global, Ga-yeon Kim believes the reason behind the content gaining momentum is the competence of the Korean industry in studying and replicating what people have liked in the past. She added, \u201cKorea is also great at innovating and adding on to these dramas, movies, and music. For instance, I hear that K-dramas and K-pop are adhering to current relatable problems faced by the younger audience, such as anxiety, depression, work-home balance, etc.\u201d Jo said K-pop, through bands like BTS and Blackpink, and dramas had synergy effects on the rising interest in Korean content around the world. \u201cIf a K-drama gains popularity, people may also pay attention to K-pop and vice versa. As many people overseas noticed K-culture and its value, they are digging hidden gems too which never caught interest from people before,\u201d she added. Asked what could be the contributing factors to the rising international interest in the country, BTS member Jung Kook told PTI last year, \u201cWe believe South Korean culture is very beautiful and attractive, which is portrayed through diverse contents such as movies, dramas, music, etc. As artists representing South Korea, we also want to share this with the rest of the world.\u201d Beomgyu, a member of the Korean boy group TXT, said South Korea narrates \u201crelatable stories\u201d which makes them resonate around the world. \u201cWherever you may be or wherever you\u2019re from, I think our shared experiences of living through these times together serve as the basis for stories that many people can relate to. I\u2019d like to say that that\u2019s the biggest reason why many people are resonating with our stories and culture now,\u201d he told PTI in June 2021.  ",
