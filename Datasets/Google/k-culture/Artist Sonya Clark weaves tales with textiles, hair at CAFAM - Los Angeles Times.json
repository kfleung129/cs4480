    "text": "\u201cMy grandmother was a tailor,\u201d recalls Sonya Clark. \u201cShe was wonderfully strong, a little woman with a soprano voice and a shock of white hair. As long as I would sit and stitch with her, she would tell me stories about her life growing up in Jamaica.\u201d And later, she says with a laugh, \u201cBeing a black woman growing up in the \u201870s, doing your hair is just something you do.\u201d Those are personal takes on how Clark got interested in using textiles \u2014 and hair \u2014 for her own method of storytelling, assemblage art. There\u2019s also a subsequent, more professional explanation: She was inspired by college courses and teachers when she attended Amherst College and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and Cranbrook Academy of Art. The interweaving of stories is Clark\u2019s forte. The 19 pieces in her exhibition \u201cSonya Clark: Material Reflex\u201d (through Sept. 8) at the Craft and Folk Art Museum deploy techniques of embroidery, weaving and braiding with materials that include cotton thread and human hair, and objects related to apparel and grooming. PHOTOS: Arts and culture by The Times \u201cThere\u2019s a real reflection on material in her work,\u201d says Karen Derksen, curator of the show and director of the Winthrop University Galleries in South Carolina. \u201cShe really looks to the function and the symbolic aspect of material, and manipulates it in a way that transcends any traditional notions we have \u2014 like the C.J. Walker portrait where she\u2019s created something so unexpected.\u201d That unexpected portrait is 11 feet tall and hangs in the museum lobby. While it appears pixelated, \u201cMadam C J Walker\u201d consists of more than 3,000 black pocket combs, then carefully linked by small wire rings. Teeth have been strategically removed to create lighter areas. An African American born in 1867 to former slaves, Walker created a hair and beauty products business that made her the first self-made female millionaire in the United States. Not only did Clark find a product identified with hair care but, as usual, also something with multiple and layered associations. \u201cThese combs are made here in the U.S.,\u201d says Clark, speaking from Richmond, Va., where she is chair of the Department of Craft/Material Studies at Virginia Commonwealth University. \u201cAlso, they\u2019re stamped \u2018unbreakable,\u2019 which makes reference to C.J. Walker as this phenomenal woman. Combs are very gendered \u2014 I associate them with men \u2014 and as a successful entrepreneur she was walking in a white man\u2019s world.\u201d Clark acknowledges that Walker\u2019s reputation is also problematic: \u201cSome blame her for popularizing the straightening of African hair.\u201d CRITICS\u2019 PICKS: The best art in town Another portrait was created using the $5 bill. Using black cotton thread, Clark stitched Abraham Lincoln with an Afro, resulting in \u201cAfro Abe.\u201d She made two when Barack Obama began running for president, then 42 more when he won \u2014 to commemorate the 44th president. \u201cFirst, he looks much better with an Afro,\u201d Clark says, \u201cand secondly it\u2019s crowning the emancipator with the hair most associated with black liberation and black power.\u201d calendar@latimes.com  It's a date Get our L.A.
