In doing so, they beat out a fairly impressive list of video music titans \u2014 including Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, One Direction and Macklemore and Ryan Lewis \u2014 sending shockwaves of self-congratulatory glee across the K-Pop fanscape. That's because, given the YTMA's parameters, the Girls' victory was literally a win by, for and about the fans: Unlike the Grammys and the MTV Video Music Awards, nominees for the YTMAs were selected solely by algorithm, based on likes, shares, views and other metrics of \"fan engagement,\" and, according to YouTube, winners were chosen based on how many fresh shares the nominated videos got in the month-long runup to the actual event (with YouTube keeping the vote-with-your-browser window open right up to the actual show itself).
