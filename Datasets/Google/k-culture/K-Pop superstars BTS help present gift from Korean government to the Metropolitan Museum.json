This morning, the Korean boy band, freshly minted as \u201cspecial presidential envoy for future  generations and culture\u201d by South Korean President Moon Jae-in, appeared with  the leader at the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New  York and spoke to the power of today\u2019s  younger generations to create a more positive and healthy world. And in the  evening, they joined the country\u2019s First Lady Kim Jung-sook, a classically  trained singer, and culture minister Hwang Hee at the Metropolitan Museum of  Art, to present a gift from the South Korean government of lacquerware vessels by  Chung Haecho. \u201cThe eyes of the world  are on Korean culture\u2014Korean dramas, Korean film, Korean music\u2014but there are still  many great Korean artists who are yet to be discovered by the world,\u201d said BTS  leader Kim Nam-joon at a bilingual reception on the Met\u2019s rooftop garden,  underneath Alex Da Corte\u2019s swinging Big  Bird sculpture, which he said he was \"very fond of\" . Kim added that in their new special envoy position, BTS felt \"a special sense of pride\" of being able to support the work of other artists from their country, and are armed with the mission \u201cto try to spread Korean culture through the world and  to everyone around the world\u201d. The gift of five richly hued vessels, Rhythm of the Five Color Luster (2013), based on the cardinal directions and five elements of East Asian cosmology, will be included in the Met\u2019s first exhibition dedicated to the art form, Shell and Resin: Korean Mother-of-Pearl and Lacquer (13 December-5 July 2022). The show will present around 30 examples drawn from the museum\u2019s collection, from an exceedingly rare 12th century trefoil box from the Goryeo dynasty (918-1392) to a mixed media painting by the contemporary artist Lee Bul. Chung Haecho (\uc815\ud574\uc870, b. 1945), Rhythm of the Five Color Luster (2013), lacquer and hemp Photo by Paula Lobo, Courtesy of The Met The history and technical development of Korean lacquer, which traditionally features mother-of-pearl decorations inlayed in pigmented resin, will be examined in the exhibition, as well as the style\u2019s significance across Asia, with examples of Chinese, Japanese, and Ryukyu (Okinawan) lacquers and South Asian mother-of-pearl. Rather than using mother-of-pearl,  Chung's focuses on Korean lacquer itself\u2014called ottchil\u2014experimenting with pigment  recipes to create works admired for their depth of colour and luster, according  to the Met. The artist\u2019s works are also in the collection of the British  Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum in London, and the Philadelphia Museum of  Art. \u201cWe\u2019re deeply grateful for this generous gift of contemporary lacquer vessels, a gesture that is particularly meaningful as we look ahead to 2023\u2014when The Met will celebrate the 25th anniversary of our Arts of Korea gallery,\u201d said the museum\u2019s director, Max Hollein. The museum is also currently looking to endow its curatorial position for Korean art through a challenge grant from the Korea Foundation, Hollein said, adding that he and some of the curatorial team plan to travel to Korea next spring. This is not the first example of BTS wielding their \"soft power\" as cultural ambassadors. Last January, the hit band launched a series of five major public art projects, involving collaborations between some of the world's most significant artists and curators around the world. Connect BTS took place across five cities from January to March 2020\u2014just before the coronavirus shut down much of  the international art world\u2014with each artist commission the result of a curator who has \"resonated with BTS's philosophy\". In a statement at the time, BTS said that \"contemporary art and music are also two different worlds. This project is especially meaningful to us because it truly represents diversity and creates a collective, positive message for the world that we value. Through this project, we hope to return the great amount of love and support from our fans, Army, and all audiences.\" The band seems to have made at least one new fan at the Met today. \"Your big hit right now is 'Permission to Dance',\" said Hollein at the gift giving. \"That's exactly what we need right now, at what I hope is the tail end of the pandemic. We need to dance more. Thank you for being here.\" ",
