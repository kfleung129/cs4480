This Saturday, soak it in without stamping your passport at the K-Pop Festival and Taste of Korea at Clayton High School. Now in its fifth year, the festival features dance crews competing for glory (and prizes) with routines choreographed to K-Pop jams. All of that dancing\u2014and watching\u2014is sure to work up an appetite,\u00a0and Taste of Korea has you covered there, too, with Korea\u2019s mouthwatering cuisine. The festival started humbly with local university-affiliated troupes, but it was clear there was major demand, so it\u2019s grown significantly. \u201cWe started at UMSL, and it was only, like, four teams competing\u2014very small scale, but it was great and people loved it,\u201d recalls Mindy Park, K-Fest's director, who's with the\u00a0Korean American Association of St. Louis. \u201cWe were, like, \u2018We\u2019ve got to keep this going!\u2019\u201d This year\u2019s event, hosted by the Korean American Association of St. Louis and sponsored by the Overseas Koreans Foundation, features nine groups competing for cash prizes. The dance crews are coming from as far as Chicago and Indiana\u2014and only about half are university groups.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just grown, we\u2019ve gotten a lot of traction,\u201d Park says. Besides the dancing and the food, this year brings a new aspect inspired by Netflix\u2019s runaway hit Squid Game,\u00a0an extremely high-stakes version of Korean kids\u2019 games. If you\u2019re familiar with the hyper-violent show, this might give you pause, but don\u2019t worry\u2014this is significantly lower\u00a0stakes than the win-or-die situation on the show.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just basically traditional games that people play as children,\u201d says Park. Food, dancing and now traditional games. \u201cIt\u2019s a triple threat,\" says Park. Tickets are $10 and include general seating and\u00a0a bulgogi rice bowl, or $25 for VIP tickets for front section seating and a Korean buffet dinner. Doors at 2:30 p.m., show at 3 p.m., Taste of Korea at 6 p.m. Tickets are\u00a0available online or at the door. Image courtesy of the K-Pop Festival and Taste of Korea November 13, 2021 5:00 AM  P.O.
