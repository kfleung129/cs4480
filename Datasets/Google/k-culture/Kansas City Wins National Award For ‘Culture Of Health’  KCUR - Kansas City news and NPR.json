The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation announced Wednesday at its headquarters in Princeton, New Jersey, that Kansas City was a recipient of a 2015 RWJF Culture of Health Prize. \u201cIt\u2019s an exemplary community for our country in terms of thinking about where we all need to go in promoting\u00a0health,\u201d said Don Schwarz, director of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Kansas City is one of eight communities receiving the award, which also includes a $25,000 cash prize. Schwarz says the foundation was particularly impressed with Kansas City\u2019s broad definition of and approach to health. In recent years, efforts including those to reduce violence, promote mentoring, increase voter registration and improve literacy have taken their place alongside more traditional health and wellness initiatives as part of Kansas City\u2019s public health strategy. \u201cWhat this prize is about is a recognition that health is much broader than access to illness care, that the entire community has to deal with the factors that influence health where we live, shop, work, play, pray,\u201d said Rex Archer, director of the Kansas City Health Department.  A video produced by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation highlights Kansas City's unique approach to health./Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Archer praised numerous partners for their role in promoting health, including the city council and police department, and community outreach organizations such as Communities Creating Opportunity and AIM4Peace. As part of its broad strategy, city health leaders and partners have also been advocating for policy and legislative changes such as increasing the minimum wage and curbing predatory lending. \u201cWe\u2019re realizing that almost every policy decision can have positive or negative health implications, and we need to be thinking those things through,\u201d Archer said. Archer says the city\u2019s programs have contributed to significant improvements in health and reduction in disparities, including a narrowing of the life expectancy gap between whites and black from 6.5 to 5 years in the last decade. Schwarz says communities around the country could learn from Kansas City\u2019s example. \u201cThe breadth of participation,\u201d said Schawrz. \u201cThe vision that says we need to focus on everyone in the community. A realization that collective impact \u2013 everyone working together to get to healthy places \u2013 all of that is important.\u201d The other cities receiving the award include Bridgeport, Connecticut; Bronx, New York; Everett, Massachusetts; Lawrence, Massachusetts; Menominee Nation in northeastern Wisconsin; Spartanburg County, South Carolina, and Waaswaaganing Anishinaabeg (Lac du Flambeau Tribe),Wisconsin.
