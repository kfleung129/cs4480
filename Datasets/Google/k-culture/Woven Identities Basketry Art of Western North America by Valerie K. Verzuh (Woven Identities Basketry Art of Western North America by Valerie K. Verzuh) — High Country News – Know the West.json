Woven Identities: Basketry Art of Western North America Valerie K. Verzuh, 219 pages, hardcover: $34.95, Museum of New Mexico Press, 2013 Few Native American languages have a word for \"art.\" Basket-weaving is not considered art, in the sense of work made for display; rather, as one Apache elder says, it is the creation of \"pieces of life to see, touch and feel.\" Whether designed for food-gathering, ceremonies or other uses, baskets are \"culture bearers,\" transmitting traditions, values and knowledge, says author Valerie Verzuh. The baskets in Verzuh's Woven Identities: Basketry Art of Western North America come from the Santa Fe Museum's 1,500-piece collection of Indian Arts and Culture and feature exquisite examples from 60 tribes, woven between 1879 and 1930. Verzuh examines materials, techniques, form, function and ornamentation, seeking each basket's \"woven identity\" \u2013 the story of where, when, why and by whom it was made, as well as the mysterious life force the weaver delivered during its creation \u2013 the Native basket-weavers' true version of \"art.\" Thanks for subscribing!
