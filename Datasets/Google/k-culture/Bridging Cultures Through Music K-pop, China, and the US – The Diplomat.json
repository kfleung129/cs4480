    "text": "Read The Diplomat, Know The Asia-Pacific Kevin Shin trained to be a K-pop star. He\u2019s now making hip hop hits in China. He\u2019s a Korean American who grew up in Seoul, Chicago, and Beijing. He trained to be a K-pop star and was offered a spot on one of most well-known K-pop bands in the world, but turned it down to join the underground rap scene in Seoul. He produced hit songs alongside one of China\u2019s most popular artists, and has now moved to Beijing to pursue his own music. Kevin Shin is a singer, songwriter, and producer who is trying to change the Chinese music scene. Early on, Shin never considered music as a career possibility. He grew up in the suburbs of Chicago wanting to be a professional soccer player. His junior year of high school, SM Entertainment, a powerhouse Korean entertainment company known for producing some of the most famous K-pop artists in the world, came to Chicago on an international talent search that spanned Asia, the United States, and Canada. After auditioning more than 6,000 kids, they picked five. Shin was one of them. Photo provided by Kevin Shin. \u201cKids in the youth ministry of my church told me I should go audition,\u201d says Shin. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about K-pop. I played piano, I played keys in a band with my friends. But I didn\u2019t think that music would be my future. I knew I was good at writing, and I didn\u2019t want to work in an office.\u201d Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. The auditions were intense. In Chicago, 400 children showed up. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know there were that many Korean kids in Chicago,\u201d says Shin. \u201cYou get a number and then line up. They bring out 30 people at a time, and they have three people judging you, kind of like American Idol. The one person steps forward and starts singing. I sang The Beatles, Let it Be. I didn\u2019t know any Korean songs.\u201d Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. In the car on the ride home with his friends, they all joked about the auditions. \u201cWe were all like, \u2018Wow, that was a stupid experience.\u2019 And then I got a phone call saying \u2018Hey, can you come back tomorrow?\u2019 I went back the next day and it was in a little hotel room. They asked me to sing. And then they asked, Can you dance?\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd I thought, I don\u2019t know how to dance! I\u2019ve never danced in my life. And they all laughed, and that\u2019s when I knew I blew my chance.\u201d A couple months later, SM called and wanted to sign a contract. Even though his parents disagreed with the process and were apprehensive about the contract, Shin signed with SM in 2006. He started training part-time in 2007 while attending college, and in 2009 he moved to Seoul for full-time training: 11 a.m.-11 p.m. days, with only every other Sunday off. In the fourth year, Shin said he could see where his hard work was leading. \u201cYou get an idea of what you\u2019re going to become. EXO was coming into fruition, and it was finally presented that it would be a 12-man team. I was going to be part of that team.\u201d EXO is a South Korean-Chinese boy band with nearly unprecedented international success. It is one of the most well-known K-pop bands in the world, and was chosen to sing at the 2018 Olympic Winter Games ceremony in PyeongChang. But Shin didn\u2019t want to join EXO. After watching the progression of other K-pop bands produced by SM, including 13-man Super Junior, Shin realized he didn\u2019t want the lifestyle K-pop offered. Despite his resolve to leave SM, it wasn\u2019t easy. SM had invested a lot of money in Shin, and negotiations took more than six months. Once Shin was a free agent, he knew where he wanted to go next. \u201cI had started listening to hip hop since grade school. I wanted to write my own songs, produce my own songs, write my own lyrics. I didn\u2019t want to dance or sing songs that other people wrote for me.\u201d After spending a year by himself creating a hip hop mix tape, Shin joined another label in Korea. He soon left after the label attempted to place him back into a boy band set-up. He then planned on creating his own label with friends, but that also fell through. \u201cThen I went completely independent,\u201d says Shin. \u201cWithin a month of leaving that company, then I dropped my first album. It was 100 percent jazz hip hop.\u201d The album was nominated and won \u201cBest Hip Hop Album of the Year\u201d in the non-mainstream Korean music scene, leading to not only praise, but opportunities to work with other artists. A few months later, Shin dropped his second album, which was nominated for the same award. Around that time, Kris Wu, a Chinese artist and actor, reached out to him. Shin and Wu had been close from their time together training at SM to join EXO. While Shin left, Kris had joined EXO and then became an extremely successful solo artist in China.

He asked me to help him out with his music. So I took a break from my music and focused on his. I helped him make his own style and find some direction. That was the last couple of years. Through him I was able to see what culture is like in China.\u201d Shin stepped into China and produced back to back hits. He produced \u201cLullaby,\u201d later used by the Beats by Dre \u201cAbove the Noise\u201d campaign, which gave him the opportunity to work with his role model, Pharrell, for several days in LA. He also wrote and produced \u201cB.M.\u201d for a global Burberry campaign. In late 2017, Shin won \u201cProducer of the Year\u201d at the 2018 China Music Awards (CMAs) for the song, \u201c6\u201d. That\u2019s when Shin noticed something in Chinese culture he hadn\u2019t seen in Korea or the United States. \u201cYoung Chinese enjoy watching dramas and TV shows, but they don\u2019t listen to a lot of music. When you walk on the streets, people don\u2019t have earphones in.\u201d China does have a paradoxical music industry, Shin argues: \u201cEven though Chinese people recognize musicians and artists, it is because they star on reality TV and in movies. Fans recognize their faces, but not their music.\u201d \u201cI saw the market and this opportunity to show younger generation what music is. It\u2019s a chance for me to change history and change culture. Luckily, I had a great team that was willing to promote and willing to support me coming into China. Without them, there was no way I would\u2019ve been able to take that leap.\u201d Shin dropped this latest album, \u201cEvolution,\u201d on November 15th. His fourth album, this is his first to drop in China, geared toward the Chinese mainstream. While the album targets young Chinese, a majority of the songs are in English. The album blends several styles of music, ranging from hip hop, pop, and R&B/soul, weaving them through a story structured by the Wu Xing \u4e94\u884c, or the \u201cFive Phases\u201d of the Chinese elements: earth (\u571f tu), wood (\u6728 mu), water (\u6c34 shui), fire (\u706b huo), and gold (or metal, \u91d1 jin). Since moving to China in early 2018, Shin has focused on simply making good, quality music. \u201cNowadays, more musicians and artists are seeking out bigger producers and songwriters in the U.S. and China. But I\u2019ve been there and I have that. I strive to be like Pharell where I produce, songwrite, and also do my own music. I want to have a say in the culture and send a message out to listeners.\u201d When asked which part of music is his favorite, he simply answers: \u201cEverything brings a different joy. Performing in front of people, the feeling when you have finished creating something, when you work with somebody or for somebody. You just feel joy.\u201d \u201cI always say, I love to write. Even in this digital world I hate texting. I love pen and paper. Music is stories. It\u2019s sharing emotions. And stories can be told with words, letters, but it can also be told with sound. It\u2019s just a matter of how to tell a story. I feel like I am the author of my story and I just want to give people the chance to listen to them. And who better to tell my story than myself?\u201d Listen to Kevin Shin\u2019s latest album Evolution, available on iTunes, Apple Music, QQ Music, Ali Music (Xiami), and other Chinese platforms.
