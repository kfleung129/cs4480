    "text": "Sections How a ruse to keep German pilots confused gave the Vitamin-A-rich vegetable too much credit K. Annabelle Smith The science is pretty sound that carrots, by virtue of their heavy dose of Vitamin A (in the form of beta carotene), are good for your eye health. A 1998 Johns Hopkins study, as reported by the New York\u00a0Times, even found that supplemental pills could reverse poor vision among those with a Vitamin A deficiency. But as John Stolarczyk knows all too well as curator of the World Carrot Museum, the truth has been stretched into a pervasive myth that carrots hold within a super-vegetable power: improving your night-time vision. But carrots cannot help you see better in the dark any more than eating blueberries will turn you blue. \u201cSomewhere on the journey the message that carrots are good for your eyes became disfigured into improving eyesight,\u201d Stolarczyk says. His virtual museum, 125 pages full of surprising and obscure facts about carrots, investigates how the myth became so popular: British propaganda from World War II. Stolarczyk is not confident about the exact origin of the faulty carrot theory, but believes that it was reinforced and popularized by the Ministry of Information, an offshoot of a subterfuge campaign to hide a technology critical to an Allied victory. During the 1940 Blitzkrieg, the\u00a0Luftwaffe often struck under the cover of darkness. In order to make it more difficult for the German planes to hit targets, the British government\u00a0issued\u00a0citywide blackouts. The Royal Air Force were able to repel the German fighters in part because of the development of a new, secret radar technology. The on-board Airborne Interception Radar (AI), first used by the RAF in 1939, had the ability to pinpoint enemy bombers before they reached the English Channel. But to keep that under wraps, according to Stolarczyk\u2019s research pulled from the files of the Imperial War Museum, the\u00a0Mass Observation Archive, and the UK National Archives,\u00a0the Ministry provided another reason for their success: carrots. In 1940, RAF night fighter ace,\u00a0John Cunningham, nicknamed \u201cCat\u2019s Eyes\u201d, was the first to shoot down an enemy plane using AI. He\u2019d later rack up an impressive total of 20 kills\u201419 of which were at night. According to  \u201cNow I Know\u201d writer Dan Lewis, also a\u00a0Smithsonian.com contributor, the Ministry told newspapers that the reason for their success was because pilots like Cunningham ate an excess of carrots. The ruse, meant to send German\u00a0tacticians on a wild goose chase, may or may not have fooled them as planned, says\u00a0Stolarczyk. \u201cI have no evidence they fell for it, other than that the use of carrots to help with eye health was well ingrained in the German psyche. It was believed that they had to fall for some of it,\u201d Stolarczyk wrote in an email as he reviewed Ministry files for his upcoming book, tentatively titled\u00a0How Carrots Helped Win World War II.\u00a0\u201cThere are apocryphal tales that the Germans started feeding their own pilots carrots, as they thought there was some truth in it.\u201d Whether or not the Germans bought it, the British public generally believed that eating carrots would help them see better during the citywide blackouts.\u00a0Advertisements with the slogan \u201cCarrots keep you healthy and help you see in the blackout\u201d \u00a0(like the one pictured below) appeared everywhere. But the carrot craze didn\u2019t stop there\u2014according to the Food Ministry, when a German blockade of food supply ships made many resources such as sugar, bacon and butter unavailable, the war could be won on the \u201cKitchen Front\u201d if people changed what they\u00a0ate and how they prepared it. In 1941, Lord Woolton, the Minister of Food, emphasized the call for self-sustainability in the garden: \u201cThis is a food war. Every extra row of vegetables in allotments saves shipping. The battle on the kitchen front cannot be won without help from the kitchen garden. Isn\u2019t an hour in the garden better than an hour in the queue?\u201d That same year, the British Ministry of Food launched a\u00a0Dig For Victory Campaign\u00a0which introduced the cartoons\u00a0\u201dDr. Carrot\u201d\u00a0\u00a0and \u201cPotato Pete\u201d, to get people to eat more of the vegetables (bread and vegetables were never on the ration during the war). Advertisements encouraged families to start \u201cVictory Gardens\u201d and to try new recipes using surplus foods as substitutes for those less available. Carrots were\u00a0promoted as a sweetener in desserts in the absence of sugar, which was\u00a0rationed\u00a0to eight ounces per adult per week. The Ministry\u2019s \u201cWar Cookery Leaflet 4\u2033 was filled with recipes for carrot pudding, carrot cake,\u00a0carrot marmalade\u00a0and\u00a0carrot flan. Concoctions like \u201cCarrolade\u201d made from rutabagas and carrots emerged from other similar sources. Citizens regularly tuned into radio broadcasts like \u201cThe Kitchen Front\u201c, a daily, five-minute BBC program that doled out hints and tips for new recipes. According to Stolarczyk, the Ministry of Food encouraged so much extra production of the vegetable that by 1942, it was looking at 100,000 ton surplus of carrots. Stolarczyk has tried many of the recipes including\u00a0Woolton Pie\u00a0(named for Lord Woolton), Carrot Flan\u00a0and Carrot Fudge. Carrolade, he says, was one of the stranger ideas. \u201cThe Ministry of Food had what I call a \u2018silly ideas\u2019 section where they threw out crazy ideas to see what would stick\u2014this was one of those,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the end of the day, the people were not stupid. If it tasted horrible, they tended to shy away.\u201d Dr. Carrot was everywhere\u2014radio shows, posters, even\u00a0Disney\u00a0helped out. Hank Porter, a leading Disney cartoonist designed a whole family based on the idea of Dr. Carrot\u2014Carroty George, Pop Carrot and Clara Carrot\u2014for the British to promote to the public. Dr. Carrot and Carroty George had some competition in the U.S., however\u2014from wise-guy carrot-chomping Bugs Bunny, born around the same time. While Bugs served his own role in\u00a0U.S. WWII propaganda cartoons, the connection between his tagline, \u201cWhat\u2019s up Doc?,\u201d and the UK\u2019s \u201cDr. Carrot\u201d is probably just a coincidence.
