The Malaysian Aviation Commission said Korean Air's merger with Asiana Airlines is aimed at saving a \"failing firm,\" and does not violate Malaysia's competition law, Korean Air said. Korean Air reported its merger with Asiana Airlines to nine countries in January this year. Thus far, it has obtained approval from Turkey and Taiwan.
