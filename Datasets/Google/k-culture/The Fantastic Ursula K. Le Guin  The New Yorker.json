Le Guin is far from immune to bouts of political anger. In an e-mail to me last winter, she wrote that she felt \u201ceaten up\u201d with frustration at the ongoing occupation of an eastern Oregon wildlife refuge by an armed band of antigovernment agitators led by the brothers Ammon and Ryan Bundy. She was distressed by the damage they had done to scientific programs and to historical artifacts belonging to the local Paiute tribe, and critical of the F.B.I. for being so slow to remove these \u201chairy gunslinging fake cowboys\u201d from public property. She had been mildly cheered up, she added, by following a Twitter feed with the hashtag #BundyEroticFanFic. The high desert of eastern Oregon is one of Le Guin\u2019s places. She often goes there in the summer with her husband, Charles, a professor emeritus of history at Portland State University, to a ranch on the stony ridge of Steens Mountain, overlooking the refuge. She has led writing workshops at the Malheur Field Station, a group of weather-beaten buildings used mainly by biologists and birders, and published a book of poems and sketches of the area, with photographs by Roger Dorband, called \u201cOut Here.\u201d She likes the awareness the desert gives her of distance, emptiness, and geological time. In a poem, \u201cA Meditation in the Desert,\u201d she imagines a stone being \u201cfull\u00a0/\u00a0of slower, longer thoughts than mind can have.\u201d She has roots in eastern Oregon that go back to the early days of white settlement. Not long ago, she told me excitedly that she\u2019d rediscovered records in the attic of her grandmother\u2019s childhood: \u201cMy great-grandfather, with my grandmother age eleven, moved from California to Oregon in 1873.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. They drove three hundred and fifty head of cattle up through Nevada and built a stone house on the back side of Steens Mountain. I don\u2019t think he made a claim; there was nowhere to make it. He was one of the very first ranchers in what is still very desolate country.\u201d The family stayed there for five years before they moved on, in search of new grass or less isolation\u2014her grandmother didn\u2019t say. The story gives hints of what Le Guin already knew: that the empty spaces of America have a past, and that loneliness and loss are mixed up with the glory. The history of America is one of conflicting fantasies: clashes over what stories are told and who gets to tell them. If the Bundy brothers were in love with one side of the American dream\u2014stories of wars fought and won, land taken and tamed\u2014Le Guin has spent a career exploring another, distinctly less triumphalist side. She sees herself as a Western writer, though her work has had a wide range of settings, from the Oregon coast to an anarchist utopia and a California that exists in the future but resembles the past. Keeping an ambivalent distance from the centers of literary power, she makes room in her work for other voices. She has always defended the fantastic, by which she means not formulaic fantasy or \u201cMcMagic\u201d but the imagination as a subversive force. \u201cImagination, working at full strength, can shake us out of our fatal, adoring self-absorption,\u201d she has written, \u201cand make us look up and see\u2014with terror or with relief\u2014that the world does not in fact belong to us at all.\u201d When I met Le Guin at her house in Portland this summer, she was in a happier mood. Coming out onto the back porch, where I was sitting with Charles in the late-afternoon sun, to offer us a bourbon-and-ice, she was positively cheerful, her deeply lined, expressive face bright under a cap of short white hair, her low, warm woodwind voice rising into an easy laugh. The bourbon is part of the couple\u2019s evening ritual: when they don\u2019t have company, they have a drink before dinner and take turns reading to each other. On the hillside below us, two scrub jays traded remarks through the trees. The cheerfulness was relative, she told me: it was partly because a conference call set for earlier that day, with the fantasy writer Neil Gaiman and some film people who had a project to propose, had been postponed, leaving her with enough energy for a conversation. Her back is bent now with age\u2014she\u2019ll be eighty-seven this month\u2014and she has to be careful with a resource she once had in abundance. \u201cMy stamina gives out so damn fast these days,\u201d she said. The house where Le Guin has lived for more than fifty years has, in certain respects, come to resemble its owner. Past the barriers at the entrance\u2014Charles\u2019s menacingly thorny roses, the lion\u2019s-head knocker that guards the door\u2014the dark-panelled Craftsman living room, with its Victorian feel, might stand for her books set in Europe, or for the great nineteenth-century novels she has always loved, with their warmth, humanity, and moral concern. The front hall is surveyed by a row of British Museum reproductions of the Lewis chessmen, souvenirs of the Le Guins\u2019 two sabbatical years in London, when their three children were small. Some of her awards are in the attic, but she keeps several, notably her first Hugo, from 1970, discreetly displayed in the hall on the way to the kitchen. A place of honor at the right of the fireplace is given to a portrait of Virginia Woolf, a hand-colored print that is a treasured gift from a writer friend. Later, I went with her into the kitchen, where it\u2019s easy to end up in the Le Guin household. It\u2019s a homey room with white appliances, cream cabinets, and no sign of steel or marble, as indifferent to fashion as its owners. Le Guin dresses well, but casually, favoring T-shirts, and wears little jewelry, though occasionally she puts on earrings fastened with clips or magnets. \u201cYou put the stone in front and a tiny magnet behind your earlobe,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe trouble is that if you bend down near the stove, for instance, all of a sudden your earrings go wham!\u2014and hit the stove. It\u2019s kind of exciting.\u201d Europe ends and the West begins outside the windows, on the back porch, with its view stretching over the Willamette River, past the city, to three volcanoes of the Cascade Range: the white peak of Mt. Adams, distant Mt. Rainier, and the sullen ash heap of Mt. St. Helens. The span of it evokes the feeling of distance and isolation that runs through her work, and the awareness, more often found in science than in fiction, that what we can comprehend is a small part of everything there is to know. Imaginative literature, she has written, asks us \u201cto allow that our perception of reality may be incomplete, our interpretation of it arbitrary or mistaken.\u201d Michael Chabon, a friend and admirer, sees her as \u201cuntiringly opening her work up to a perspective, to a nature that feels somehow beyond human, and yet fully human and recognizable. She gives us a view from the other side.\u201d To talk to Le Guin is to encounter alternatives. At her house, the writer is present, but so is Le Guin the mother of three, the faculty wife: the woman writing fantasy in tandem with her daily life. I asked her recently about a particularly violent story that she wrote in her early thirties, in two days, while organizing a fifth-birthday party for her elder daughter. \u201cIt\u2019s funny how you can live on several planes, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she said. She resists attempts to separate her more mainstream work from her science fiction. She is a genre author who is also a literary author, not one or the other but indivisibly both. Le Guin can be polemical, prone to what one close friend calls \u201ctirades\u201d on questions she feels strongly about. I once watched her participate in a panel discussion on gender and literature at WisCon, an annual gathering of feminist science-fiction writers, readers, and academics in Madison, Wisconsin. Scowling like a snapping turtle, she sat waiting for illogical remarks, which she then gently but firmly tore to bits. Yet a conversation with Le Guin is often full of comic asides, laughter, and\u2014a particularly Le Guin trait\u2014good-natured snorts. Humor seems to be her way of taking the edge off the polemic, as well as an introvert\u2019s channel of communication. Behind even the lightest remarks, one is aware of a keen intelligence and a lifetime of thought, held back for the purposes of casual conversation. She has never felt at home temperamentally with establishments of any kind. But now she finds the establishment wanting to hear what she has to say. Her criticism of the economics of publishing\u2014objections to Amazon, a fight with Google over its digitization of copyrighted books\u2014is widely reported in the news. Earlier this year, a Kickstarter campaign for a documentary about Le Guin, by the filmmaker Arwen Curry, raised more than two hundred thousand dollars, nearly three times the requested amount. In 2000, the Library of Congress declared her a \u201cliving legend,\u201d a designation that has made its way into many introductions to her readings. Last month, her \u201cOrsinian Tales\u201d and the novel \u201cMalafrena\u201d appeared as a volume in the Library of America. (She and Philip Roth are the only living novelists included in the series.) \u201cI am getting really sick of being referred to as \u2018the legendary,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she protests, laughing. \u201cI\u2019m right here. I have gravity. A body and all that.\u201d In the late nineteen-thirties, in a tall house in Berkeley, California, a girl climbs out the attic window onto the roof in search of solitude. If she scrambles far enough up the redwood shingles, she can reach her own Mt. Olympus, the roof\u2019s peak. From here, she can gaze out over the rough blue of the bay to the city of San Francisco, row upon row of white houses climbing the hills above the water. The city is strange to her\u2014she rarely ventures so far from home\u2014but the view is hers, and splendid. Beyond it she knows there are islands with a magical name: the Farallons. She imagines them as \u201cthe loneliest place, the farthest west you could go.\u201d Meanwhile, inside the house, the girl\u2019s father is at work, thinking about myths, magic, songs, cultural patterns\u2014the proper territory of a professor of anthropology. From him she will take a model for creative work in the midst of a rich family life, as well as the belief that the real room of one\u2019s own is in the writer\u2019s mind. Years later, she tells a friend that if she ended up writing about wizards \u201cperhaps it\u2019s because I grew up with one.\u201d Ursula Kroeber was born in Berkeley, in 1929, into a family busy with the reading, recording, telling, and inventing of stories. She grew up listening to her aunt Betsy\u2019s memories of a pioneer childhood and to California Indian legends retold by her father. One legend of the Yurok people says that, far out in the Pacific Ocean but not farther than a canoe can paddle, the rim of the sky makes waves by beating on the surface of the water. On every twelfth upswing, the sky moves a little more slowly, so that a skilled navigator has enough time to slip beneath its rim, reach the outer ocean, and dance all night on the shore of another world. Ursula absorbed these stories, together with the books she read: children\u2019s classics, Norse myths, Irish folktales, the Iliad. In her father\u2019s library, she discovered Romantic poetry and Eastern philosophy, especially the Tao Te Ching. She and her brother Karl supplemented these with science-fiction magazines. With Karl, the closest to her in age of her three brothers, she played King Arthur\u2019s knights, in armor made of cardboard boxes. The two also made up tales of political intrigue and exploration set in a stuffed-toy world called the Animal Kingdom. This storytelling later gave her a feeling of kinship with the Bront\u00ebs, whose Gondal and Angria, she says, were \u201cthe \u2018genius version\u2019 of what Karl and I did.\u201d Her father was Alfred L. Kroeber, one of the most influential cultural anthropologists of the past century. A New Yorker from a prosperous German immigrant family, he went west in 1900, when he was twenty-four, and did field work among the Indians of Northern California. Throughout his career, he learned about cultures that were rapidly being transformed or destroyed from men and women who were among the last survivors of their people. At a time when the dominant story of America was one of European conquest, Ursula was aware, through her father and his Indian friends who came to the house, that there were other stories to tell and other judgments that might be made. Link copied Ursula\u2019s mother was Theodora Kracaw Kroeber, born in Denver in 1897 and raised in the mining town of Telluride. A friend of Le Guin\u2019s recalls seeing her, at the house in Berkeley, \u201ccoming down the long staircase, a majestic-looking woman with a long gown and a great big Indian silver and turquoise necklace. She was very stately.\u201d Theodora took to writing in her late fifties, and produced \u201cIshi in Two Worlds,\u201d a nonfiction account of the last survivor of the Yahi people. Le Guin loved her mother and admired her psychological gifts. But she says that their relationship also contained \u201csomething darker and stranger\u201d that she has never quite understood. \u201cWe were very lucky, because we never had to act that out. But if I see daughters and mothers act it out toward each other it doesn\u2019t shock me or surprise me. It\u2019s there.\u201d The Kroeber household was full of voices as well as stories. Alfred liked to pose philosophical questions or puzzles over the dinner table and ask his four children about anything that interested them. The kids were encouraged to take an active part in the conversation, but, as the little sister, Ursula rarely got a word in: \u201cThere were too many people, and I was outshouted by everybody else.\u201d Learning how to be heard taught her persistence and gave her a tendency to appear fiercer than she is. \u201cPeople think I mean everything I say and am full of conviction, often, when I\u2019m actually just floating balloons and ready for a discussion or argument or further pursuit of the subject. It\u2019s my fault\u2014I speak so passionately. Probably because, as the youngest and shrillest child of an extraordinarily articulate and passionate family, I could only be heard by charging over the top, shouting, \u2018Marchons, marchons! Qu\u2019un sang impur abreuve nos sillons!\u2019 every time I entertained a passing opinion.\u201d Le Guin\u2019s work combines a Berkeleyite\u2019s love of alternative thought with a strong scientific bent that she sees as an inheritance from her father. In her fiction, she has tried to balance the analytical and the intuitive. \u201cBoth directions strike me as becoming more and more sterile the farther you follow them,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s when they can combine that you get something fertile and living and leading forward. Mysticism\u2014which is a word my father held in contempt, basically\u2014and scientific factualism, need for evidence, and so on\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. I do try to juggle them, quite consciously.\u201d If it was difficult to be the youngest and most precocious of the Kroeber children, leaving the house to enter the world made Ursula feel like \u201can exile in a Siberia of adolescent social mores.\u201d In the fall of 1944, at fourteen, small for her age, disguised in the sweater, skirt, and loafers of a \u201cbobby-soxer\u201d (a term that still makes her shudder), she began her first year at Berkeley High School, a huge, impersonal institution where popularity mattered more than learning, and fitting in was the ideal. When Le Guin speaks of her teen-age years, she speaks of loneliness, confusion, and the pain of being among people who have no use for one\u2019s gifts. \u201cYou\u2019re just dropped into this dreadful place, and there are no explanations why and no directions what to do.\u201d She found a refuge in the public library, reading Austen and the Bront\u00ebs, Turgenev and Shelley. In fiction, she could satisfy her deep romantic streak: she fell in love with Prince Andrei in \u201cWar and Peace\u201d and once, at thirteen, defaced a library book by cutting out a still of Laurence Olivier\u2019s Mr. Darcy and taking it home to look at in private, guilty rapture. From Thomas Hardy she learned to handle strong feelings in fiction by pouring them into landscapes, letting the settings carry part of the emotional charge. \u201cThere\u2019s a patronizing word for that: the \u2018pathetic fallacy,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a fallacy; it\u2019s art.\u201d As a child, she was painfully shy, and she still alludes to anxieties that she keeps hidden from the world. I caught a glimpse of that when she asked me, cautiously, \u201cWouldn\u2019t you say that anybody who thought as much about balance as I do in my work probably felt some threat to their balance?\u201d After a long pause, she added, \u201cOf course all adolescents are out of balance, and very aware of it. To become adult can certainly feel like walking a high wire, can\u2019t it? If my foot slips, I\u2019m gone. I\u2019m dead.\u201d Equilibrium is a central metaphor in Le Guin\u2019s great works about adolescence, the six-volume Earthsea series, which began in 1968 with \u201cA Wizard of Earthsea.\u201d That book follows Ged, a lonely teen-ager with a gift for magic, who at wizards\u2019 school learns a painful lesson in achieving balance rather than forcing change. There\u2019s little resemblance between the school on Roke Island, with its Taoist magic (a mage is taught to \u201cdo by not doing\u201d), and Harry Potter\u2019s Hogwarts. There is some resemblance between Ged, the provincial boy with a chip on his shoulder, and Ursula Kroeber, the Californian in jeans arriving at Radcliffe College in 1947, all books and opinions, never before out of her home state, eager to prove herself as a poet. Her Radcliffe friend Jean Taylor Kroeber, who became her sister-in-law, recalls that, before she and Ursula bonded over Russian literature, jokes, and music, she found her \u201ca little frightening. It\u2019s not that she meant to be, but that\u2019s the way it came across\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. that there was a good chance that she was ahead of you, in wherever the conversation was going. And one rather brief acute remark could set you back on your heels.\u201d Ursula had her first clash with the literary establishment when she and a friend signed up to read submissions for a new Radcliffe literary magazine, Signature. Rona Jaffe worked on the magazine, and its undergraduate contributors included Edward Gorey, Harold Brodkey, and Adrienne Rich, whose poem \u201cStorm Warnings\u201d was published there. The magazine accepted nothing of Ursula\u2019s, and she found those fellow-students \u201ccliquish and unfriendly\u201d: \u201cTheir comments on what we submitted ourselves, even the comments on our comments, were often remarkably savage and dismissive. We got out again and gratefully went back to our invisibility.\u201d When Rich won the Yale Younger Poets Prize in her senior year, Le Guin, still unpublished, felt pangs of envy. On top of that, Radcliffe women were given a double message, receiving an excellent education while knowing, in Rich\u2019s words, that \u201cthe real power (and money) were invested in Harvard\u2019s institutions, from which we were excluded.\u201d Though Radcliffe has long since become part of Harvard, Cambridge remains a place of mixed emotions for Le Guin. She has told me both that her college years were wonderful and that she has come to dislike the institution; the two emotions shadow each other. Her senior year was marred by a handsome and arrogant Harvard student, an accidental pregnancy, a broken heart, and an illegal abortion. \u201cI\u2019m often startled at the depth of my anger at Harvard,\u201d she told me. \u201cI know some of the reasons for it, but it wouldn\u2019t be so immediate and uncontrollable if it were accessible to reason. I did get a splendid education there\u2014there was wonderful Widener, the Fogg, the elmy campus, which I remember fondly. But the anger\u2019s there like a mine, ready to go off at a quiver of the ground.\u201d Le Guin graduated from Radcliffe with a degree in French, in 1951. Over the decade that followed, she wrote poems, short stories, and at least four novels. She submitted them to publishers; they came back with encouraging rejections. She felt her way tentatively forward, unsure of her direction, lacking models. American literature was still under the spell of Hemingway, Faulkner, Richard Wright; realism held sway, and there was little interest in play or fantasy. \u201cI was going in another direction than the critically approved culture was,\u201d Le Guin has said. \u201cI was never going to be Norman Mailer or Saul Bellow. I didn\u2019t know who my fellow-writers were. There didn\u2019t seem to be anybody doing what I wanted to do.\u201d She was alarmed by the literary rivalries of the period; she remembers thinking, \u201cI\u2019m not competing with all these guys and their empires and territories. I just want to write my stories and dig my own garden.\u201d Instead, she found \u201callies in foreigners I never met,\u201d reading Woolf\u2019s \u201cOrlando,\u201d Isak Dinesen\u2019s \u201cSeven Gothic Tales,\u201d and the short stories of Sylvia Townsend Warner, with their playful and revelatory shifts of perspective. She also became fascinated by the premature, failed revolutions of 1830 and the passionate political documents of the Romantic period, such as \u201cMy Prisons,\u201d by the Italian poet and patriot Silvio Pellico. \u201cBooks like that were very exciting to me because I could handle them better than I could the contemporary works,\u201d she says. They opened up \u201cthe distance that I needed, and probably have always needed, between me and the raw, implacable fact that\u2019s going on right now. I\u2019ve never really been able to handle that. If it\u2019s right in my face, I can\u2019t see it.\u201d Some writers of her generation embraced confessional literature and, later, memoir. Le Guin has always preferred self-concealment to self-exposure. In the introduction to the Library of America volume, she writes, \u201cI have no interest in confession. My games are transformation and invention.\u201d In college, she began setting her fiction in an imaginary Eastern European country called Orsinia and found that it freed her up as a writer. Away from the \u201csmall and stony\u201d ground of realism, her imagination began to flourish. Orsinia also gave her the distance to comment, indirectly, on Communist repression, the persecutions of the McCarthy era, the unfreedom of the age, and her decision to follow her own path. During the fifties, she worked on \u201cMalafrena,\u201d a novel about a young nobleman who obeys his moral compass by fighting for freedom of speech and thought. Freedom is \u201ca human need, like bread, like water,\u201d he insists. Pressed to define it, he replies, \u201cFreedom consists in doing what you can do best, your work, what you have to do.\u201d For Le Guin freedom is a complex ideal and a word \u201ctoo big and too old\u201d to be devalued as a platitude or appropriated by hypocrites. \u201cOf course it gets misused,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think you can really damage the word freedom or liberty.\u201d Another of Le Guin\u2019s places is Cannon Beach, a summer town on the Oregon coast where she and Charles have a small house on a street leading to the ocean. Although she claims to share her father\u2019s \u201cincapacity for reminiscence,\u201d she and I went there to talk about her past. The prospect made her uncomfortable at first, and when we entered the shut-up house she threw nervous energy into cleaning, enlisting me to stand on a chair and brush cobwebs off the ceiling. At a little kitchen table, over tea served in the indestructible handmade earthenware mugs of the seventies, she commented, somewhat defiantly, that she had always taken pleasure in cooking and keeping house. It sounded like criticism of the heroic writer, alone in his garret, but there\u2019s more to it than that. She feels that marriage and family have given her a stability that supported her writing\u2014the freedom of solitude within the solidity of household life. \u201cAn artist can go off into the private world they create, and maybe not be so good at finding the way out again,\u201d she told me. \u201cThis could be one reason I\u2019ve always been grateful for having a family and doing housework, and the stupid ordinary stuff that has to be done that you cannot let go.\u201d When Ursula graduated from Radcliffe, her plan was to get her doctorate and become an academic, like her three older brothers. She got her master\u2019s in Romance languages at Columbia University, then received a Fulbright fellowship to do research in France for her dissertation. On the boat going over, she met Charles LeGuin, a historian with an attractive Georgia accent who was writing his thesis on the French Revolution. They shared a sense of humor; they liked the same books; in Paris, they went together to the opera and the Louvre. Within two weeks they were engaged. When they applied for a marriage license, a \u201ctriumphant bureaucrat\u201d told Charles his Breton name was \u201cspelled wrong\u201d without a space, so when they married they both took the name Le Guin. Ursula abandoned her Ph.D. thesis on medieval French poetry, and while Charles finished researching his own thesis she read, wrote, and talked with him about Europe and revolution. Charles became the first reader for all her work, made sure she got time to write, and when they had children shared in their care. They spent the next few years in Georgia and Idaho, until, in 1959, Charles got the job at Portland State. Ursula recalls flying up from Berkeley with a child on her lap and pregnant with her second. \u201cThe plane came in low up the Willamette Valley and circled the city, and I was in tears, it was so beautiful. I thought, My God, I\u2019m going to live there.\u201d Link copied Stubbornness and a self-confessed arrogance about her work helped Le Guin through her unpublished years. Then and now, she feels that she is the best judge of her writing; she is unmoved by literary trends, and not easily swayed by editorial suggestion. \u201cWriting was always my inmost way of being in the world,\u201d she says, but that made rejections increasingly painful: \u201cI suffered a good deal from the contradiction between knowing writing was the job I was born for and finding nowhere to have that knowledge confirmed.\u201d Then, in 1961 and 1962, two of Le Guin\u2019s stories were published. One, set in Orsinia, a meditation on the consolations of art, went to a small literary journal. The second, about a junior professor liberated from academia by an act of magic, was bought by the science-fiction magazine Fantastic. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know what to do with my stuff until I stumbled into science fiction and fantasy,\u201d Le Guin says. \u201cAnd then, of course, they knew what to do with it.\u201d \u201cThey\u201d were the editors, fans, and fellow-authors who gave her an audience for her work. If science fiction was down-market, it was at least a market. More than that, genre supplied a ready-made set of tools, including spaceships, planets, and aliens, plus a realm\u2014the future\u2014that set no limits on the imagination. She found that science fiction suited what she called, in a letter to her mother, her \u201cpeculiar\u201d talent, and she felt a lightheartedness in her writing that had to do with letting go of ambitions and constraints. In the fall of 1966, when she was thirty-seven, Le Guin began \u201cA Wizard of Earthsea.\u201d In the next few years\u2014which also saw her march against the Vietnam War and dance in a conga line with Allen Ginsberg, when he came to Portland to read Vedas for peace\u2014she produced her great early work, including, in quick succession, \u201cThe Left Hand of Darkness,\u201d \u201cThe Lathe of Heaven,\u201d \u201cThe Farthest Shore,\u201d and \u201cThe Dispossessed,\u201d her ambitious novel of anarchist utopia. Science fiction opened her up further to writing from alien points of view\u2014composing the political manifesto of an ant, wondering what it would be like if humans had the seasonal sexuality of birds, imagining love in a society in which a marriage involves four people. Le Guin says her ambition has always been \u201cnot just trying to get into other minds but other beings.\u201d She adds, \u201cSomewhere in the nineteenth century a line got drawn: you can\u2019t do this for grownups. But fantasy and science fiction just kind of walked around the line.\u201d Another use of the fantastic for Le Guin was to bring her ethical concerns into her fiction without becoming didactic. Take a metaphor far enough and it becomes a parable, as with her widely anthologized story \u201cThe Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas.\u201d Le Guin\u2019s story begins with an ethical question posed by William James: If all could be made blissfully happy by the fact that one person was being kept in torment, would we accept that condition? She gives the problem just enough reality for the reader to picture the single abused child and feel the consequences of the bargain. Her influential thought experiment \u201cThe Left Hand of Darkness\u201d uses this strategy to explore gender and alterity. Genly Ai, a man from a future Earth, arrives on the planet Gethen, which is inhabited by human beings who are neither male nor female but, for a few days a month, in a sexual phase, can become either. Ai, as a permanent male, is to them a \u201cpervert.\u201d His isolation and wariness are mirrored in the landscape of Gethen, a place of perpetual winter. No one trusts Ai but Estraven, a Gethenian who is in exile; these two characters take turns narrating the book, so that we see how strange they appear to each other, and how they struggle to connect. Among the book\u2019s central themes are balance\u2014light is the left hand of darkness, the Gethenian saying goes\u2014and trust. These are set against anxieties about otherness, about control and the loss of it. Estraven hopes that Ai can prevent impending war between two rival states, and asks him: \u201cDo you know, by your own experience, what patriotism is?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I said, shaken by the force of that intense personality suddenly turning itself wholly upon me. \u201cI don\u2019t think I do. If by patriotism you don\u2019t mean the love of one\u2019s homeland, for that I do know.\u201d \u201cNo, I don\u2019t mean love, when I say patriotism. I mean fear. The fear of the other. And its expressions are political, not poetical: hate, rivalry, aggression. It grows in us, that fear.\u201d To fulfill this mission, Ai must see beyond his own narrow perspective and learn to trust, even love, this person whose nature calls his own into question. The novel earned Le Guin her first Hugo and Nebula awards, the top honors in science fiction; her migration from the margins was well under way. Despite her growing success, she suffered periods of depression in the nineteen-sixties\u2014\u201cdark passages that I had to work through\u201d is how she described them to me, as if they were vexed sequences in a novel. She wrote them into her fiction, she added, in the Earthsea novel \u201cThe Farthest Shore,\u201d exploring a metaphor she borrowed from Rilke\u2019s \u201cDuino Elegies\u201d: depression as a journey through the silent land of the dead. Another difficult time for her came in the long period that began after \u201cThe Dispossessed\u201d was published, in 1974, when she was rethinking the subjects of her work. She had been writing about imaginary revolutions, but by then an actual liberation movement, feminism, was gaining traction. In the light of \u201cthe personal is political,\u201d her \u201cLeft Hand of Darkness\u201d seemed to some readers too oblique and metaphorical, her sense of play not illuminating but evasive. Up until then, almost all of Le Guin\u2019s protagonists had been male, and she wasn\u2019t sure how to write from a woman\u2019s perspective, especially since she had long resisted writing directly from personal experience. As a wife and mother who had always had her husband\u2019s support, she was wary of the angry anti-family rhetoric of some mid-nineteen-seventies feminists. She explained, \u201cI had lost confidence in the kind of writing I had been doing because I was (mostly unconsciously) struggling to learn how to write as a woman, not as an \u2018honorary man\u2019 as before, and with a freedom that scared me.\u201d She went on working steadily, writing short stories, essays, poetry, and young-adult fiction. She revised and published some of her older work: \u201cOrsinian Tales\u201d (which was a finalist for a National Book Award) appeared in 1976; \u201cMalafrena\u201d in 1979. She did begin writing from female points of view. But her turn to \u201cwriting as a woman,\u201d while it won her new readers, alienated part of her old audience. Some of her new work was criticized as unsubtle or moralistic. Her mother died in 1979, a painful loss. She came to think of this time as \u201cthe dark hard place.\u201d Le Guin emerged from this period by stepping over the boundaries that separated science fiction and literature. Starting in the nineteen-eighties, she published some of her most accomplished work\u2014fiction that was realist, magic realist, postmodernist, and sui generis. She wrote the Borgesian feminist parable \u201cShe Unnames Them,\u201d and in 1985 an experimental tour de force of a novel, \u201cAlways Coming Home.\u201d She produced \u201cSur,\u201d the epic tale of an all-female Antarctic exploring party that may be her greatest and funniest feminist statement. Her short stories began appearing in The New Yorker, where her editor, Charles McGrath, saw in her an ability to \u201ctransform genre fiction into something higher.\u201d In fact, it was the mainstream that ended up transformed. By breaking down the walls of genre, Le Guin handed new tools to twenty-first-century writers working in what Chabon calls the \u201cborderlands,\u201d the place where the fantastic enters literature. A group of writers as unlike as Chabon, Molly Gloss, Kelly Link, Karen Joy Fowler, Junot D\u00edaz, Jonathan Lethem, Victor LaValle, Zadie Smith, and David Mitchell began to explore what\u2019s possible when they combine elements of realism and fantasy. The fantasy and science-fiction scholar Brian Attebery has noted that \u201cevery writer I know who talks about Ursula talks about a sense of having been invited or empowered to do something.\u201d Given that many of Le Guin\u2019s protagonists have dark skin, the science-fiction writer N.\u00a0K. Jemisin speaks of the importance to her and others of encountering in fantasy someone who looked like them. Karen Joy Fowler, a friend of Le Guin\u2019s whose novel \u201cWe Are All Completely Beside Ourselves\u201d questions the nature of the human-animal bond, says that Le Guin offered her alternatives to realism by bringing the fantastic out of its \u201cunderdog position.\u201d For writers, she says, Le Guin \u201cmakes you think many things are possible that you maybe didn\u2019t think were possible.\u201d Le Guin still has strong feelings about artistic liberty. In November, 2014, she travelled to New York with her son, Theo, to accept the Distinguished Contribution medal at the National Book Awards ceremony. In a new collection of nonfiction, \u201cWords Are My Matter,\u201d she writes that drafting her six-minute speech took her six months. \u201cI rethought and replanned it, anxiously, over and over. Even on a poem, I\u2019ve never worked so long and so obsessively, or with so little assurance that what I was saying was right, was what I ought to say.\u201d But, having clashed with corporate publishing in the past, she felt an obligation to take the industry to task. Standing at the lectern, she gave an uncharacteristically apologetic smile. Then she scowled at her audience of editors and publishers and unleashed a tirade. \u201cI see sales departments given control over editorial. I see my own publishers, in a silly panic of ignorance and greed, charging public libraries for an e-book six or seven times more than they charge customers.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. And I see a lot of us, the producers, who write the books and make the books, accepting this\u2014letting commodity profiteers sell us like deodorant and tell us what to publish, and what to write.\u201d Instead, she admonished them, \u201cWe\u2019ll need writers who can remember freedom\u2014poets, visionaries\u2014realists of a larger reality.\u201d At her conclusion, members of the audience hesitated, looked around, and then slowly rose to their feet for an ovation. Starting in the nineteen-nineties, Le Guin returned in earnest to historical fiction, in \u201cLavinia,\u201d and to science fiction and fantasy. Some of her best late work in this mode appears in \u201cThe Found and the Lost,\u201d a new eight-hundred-plus-page compendium of her novellas. But a few years ago Le Guin stopped writing fiction, saying it took an energy she didn\u2019t have\u2014although she doesn\u2019t rule out anything in the future. \u201cNever\u201d and \u201clast,\u201d she wrote in a recent blog post, \u201care closing words. Having spent a good deal of my life trying to open closed doors and windows, I have no intention of going around slamming them shut now.\u201d She still gives readings, which attract a notably youthful audience. And she writes nonfiction, including book reviews for the Guardian, in which she is glowing in her enthusiasms and fierce in her dislikes. (The enthusiasms include works by Saramago, Rushdie, and Atwood; the dislikes include present-tense narration, fiction about \u201cdysfunctional American suburban families,\u201d and mainstream writers who attempt science fiction without understanding its rules.) She is turning more now to poetry; her most recent collection, \u201cLate in the Day,\u201d was published last year. She told me she was writing some poems exploring extreme old age, playing with the metaphor of an explorer\u2019s sea voyage to the West. \u201cI think some testimony from the late eighties could be useful to people,\u201d she said. Then she added, laughing, \u201cOther people in their late eighties might want to read it. I don\u2019t know about anybody in their late fifties: \u2018Oh, God, I don\u2019t want to go there.\u2019\u00a0\u201d At the house in Cannon Beach, she showed me the family\u2019s photo albums. Over the years, Le Guin\u2019s author photos show a steady progression from a wary young woman, ill at ease in front of the camera, to someone more at home in a public role. But I had asked about the private photos, and here was Ursula, age six or seven, with short black hair, bare-legged on dusty California ground, playing with a toy car and staring into the distance at something unseen. \u201cI like that one,\u201d she told me. \u201cI look feral. I guess I was rather feral.\u201d Then there was Ursula at the Arc de Triomphe, a gamine holding an armful of roses, and Charles, looking dashing in a new Parisian coat, climbing Mont Sainte-Victoire. Infants enter the pictures, then small children. In a photo of Ursula in her twenties, she glances up from a typewriter with a look I\u2019d come to recognize: startled, her eyes unfocussed, her thoughts in a place the camera can\u2019t follow. The next morning, Le Guin stood in the front yard of her house at the edge of the world, feeding a family of crows. The sun was out, and a block away the surf beat gently on the broad beach, where the town meets the waters of the North Pacific. Here the land seemed undone by the unknown distances of the ocean, and Le Guin seemed to be standing where the forces met, gazing beyond her garden to some farther shore.\u00a0\u2666 By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.
