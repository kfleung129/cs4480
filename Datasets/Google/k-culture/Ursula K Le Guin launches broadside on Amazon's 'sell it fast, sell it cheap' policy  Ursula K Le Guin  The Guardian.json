    "text": "Fantasy author accuses the online giant of using its market dominance \u2018to control what we write and what we read\u2019 The grande dame of fantasy Ursula K Le Guin has weighed in forcefully to the debate about Amazon\u2019s role in publishing. In a blogpost on the site Book View Cafe, entitled \u201cUp the Amazon with the BS Machine, or Why I Keep Asking You Not to Buy Books from Amazon\u201d, the American author has spoken out against what she describes as the company\u2019s increasing influence not only on the bookselling market but also on which books get published, promoted and read. Her fierce conclusion is: \u201cEvery book purchase made from Amazon is a vote for a culture without content and without contentment.\u201d After an analysis of how the \u201cBest Seller Machine\u201d has worked in the last decades, Le Guin writes that the online retailer is changing the culture of publishing. The Amazon model, she writes, is \u201ceasy salability, heavy marketing, super-competitive pricing, then trash and replace\u201d. The ideal book, under this template, is \u201ca safe commodity, a commercial product written to the specifications of the current market, that will hit the BS list, get to the top, and vanish. Sell it fast, sell it cheap, dump it, sell the next thing.\u201d She adds that \u201cany publisher willing to print a book that isn\u2019t easy to market, or to keep books that sell modestly but steadily in print, is bucking this trend. Most of them are small houses. The few big publishers that now continue functioning at all under the deliberately destructive pressure of Amazon marketing strategies are increasingly controlled by that pressure.\u201d The tech giant is not only trying to control the bookselling industry but also the publishing world, she writes: \u201cAmazon uses the BS Machine to sell us sweetened fat to live on, so we begin to think that\u2019s what literature is.\u201d She assures her readers that her \u201conly quarrel with Amazon is when it comes to how they market books and how they use their success in marketing to control not only bookselling, but book publication: what we write and what we read.\u201d She stressed that she has no issue with other areas of the tech giant\u2019s business, including self-publishing: \u201cAmazon and I are not at war. There are vast areas in which my peaceful indifference to what Amazon is and does can only be surpassed by Amazon\u2019s presumably equally placid indifference to what I say and do. If you like to buy household goods or whatever through Amazon, that\u2019s totally fine with me. If you think Amazon is a great place to self-publish your book, I may have a question or two in mind, but still, it\u2019s fine with me, and none of my business anyhow.\u201d Other high-profile authors who have protested against the tech giant\u2019s growing power include Stephen King, Donna Tartt, Paul Auster, James Patterson, John Grisham and Jennifer Egan, all of whom signed the campaign against the online retailer over its dispute with Hachette last year.
