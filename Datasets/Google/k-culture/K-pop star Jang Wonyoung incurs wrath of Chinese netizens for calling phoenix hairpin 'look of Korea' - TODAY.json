The netizens felt that the phoenix is a Chinese motif and that the star \"stole from their culture\". PARIS\u00a0\u2014 Jang Wonyoung, South Korea\u2019s up-and-coming K-pop star,\u00a0has come\u00a0under fire from Chinese netizens for what they perceive as her appropriating Chinese culture. Better known as Yonyoung, the artiste\u00a0from K-pop girl group IVE recently appeared in her \u201cfirst ever Paris trip vlog\u201d in a Vogue Korea video that was uploaded on Sunday (Oct 16). The star was in Paris for jewellery brand Fred\u2019s exhibition, titled \u201cFred Joaillier cr\u00e9ateur depuis 1936\u201d. Wonyoung walked the streets of Paris, sampled gelato and gave viewers a rundown of her outfit during the vlog. Showing off her phoenix hairpin in an updo, she said: \u201cI also put on this hairpin to show the look of Korea in Paris.\u201d This upset\u00a0some Chinese netizens, who felt that she was \"stealing from their culture\". The hairpin from South Korean jewellery brand Naschenka features a silver phoenix sitting atop the hair pin. On Instagram, the brand described the hairpin as \u201ca hairpin that represents the beauty of Korea. A silver hairpin originally from Korea\u201d. A post shared by \uc870\uc120 \uc655\uc2e4 \uc7a5\uc2e0\uad6c \u00b7 \ud55c\ubcf5 \ube44\ub140 \u00b7 \ub4a4\uaf42\uc774 \u00b7 \ub178\ub9ac\uac1c (@nas.naschenka) Chinese internet company NetEase reported on 163.com that incensed Chinese netizens went on to Weibo to voice out that the \"phoenix has been China\u2019s since ancient times\" and that \u201cboth the brand and Jang Wonyoung is stealing from our culture\u201d. \"She should correct herself and apologise, saying she didn't know that the phoenix belonged to China,\" said one netizen. However, some Chinese netizens noted that Wonyoung did not mention the phoenix specifically, only that she was bringing the look of Korea to Paris with her hairpin. Hence she might have meant that she wanted to wear Korean brands internationally. Twitter users also reacted to \u00a0American\u00a0K-pop news site\u00a0AllKpop\u2019s tweet on the story of\u00a0the\u00a0controversy\u00a0surrounding the phoenix hairpin. \u201c(The) phoenix comes from (a) Chinese myth and (the) phoenix hairpin is (a) Chinese traditional hair accessory. It is a fact. Wonyoung made a mistake,\u201d one Twitter user said. Other Twitter users defended Wonyoung. One said\u00a0that Korean phoenix hairpin designs were found in past Korean dynasties, dating all the way back to the ancient Korean states\u00a0such as Baekje (18 BC \u2013 660 AD) and Silla (57 BC \u2013 935 AD). The user pulled out the receipts \u2014 referencing phoenix hairpins used in the Goryeo Dynasty and motifs of phoenixes used on plates, pottery and even decorating the ceiling of Korean palaces throughout various Korean dynasties. Netizens also noted that as neighbouring countries, the cross pollination of culture is inevitable and therefore having similar artefacts, themes and motifs is no surprise. \u201cSinosphere countries at it again,\u201d one Twitter user lamented. \u201cPhoenix exists in Vietnam, Japan, China and Korea culture... we are all like 5 feet away from each other, why is it so hard to understand that our culture has a lot in common?\u201d According to the Encyclopaedia of Korea Folk Culture, the phoenix or \u201cbonghwang\u201d was used to decorate objects, clothing and royal buildings, largely symbolising the royalty in ancient Korea. It was regarded as a symbol of female royalties, similar to ancient China where the phoenix symbolised the Empress alongside the Emperor represented by a dragon, as reported by China Daily. This is not the first time China and South Korea are caught in a debate over supposed cultural appropriation. During the Beijing Winter Olympics held in February this year, a woman appeared wearing a hanbok \u2014 the traditional Korean dress \u2014 during the opening ceremony. The appearance of the\u00a0hanbok-wearing\u00a0performer in the opening ceremony sparked an outcry from South Korea as it was seen as an attempt to claim aspects of Korean culture as China\u2019s own. The Chinese embassy in Seoul defended the decision to include a participant wearing hanbok, describing her as a representative of the joseonjok \u2013 an ethnic group with roots in Korea\u00a0\u2014 among the more than 50 other ethnic groups in China, reported The Guardian.
