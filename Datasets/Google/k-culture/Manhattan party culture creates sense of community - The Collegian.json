    "text": "By Kelsey Kendall & Danielle Cook In Aggieville, friendships can start with strangers lighting each other\u2019s cigarettes. In a house party, friendships can start with a stranger\u2019s willingness to share their Jimmy John\u2019s. Many Kansas State students have found a sense of community in spending their weekends immersed in Manhattan\u2019s party culture, from the bars of Aggieville to private house parties. Aggieville Culture Plenty of K-State students would say when they come to Aggieville at night, they expect to have a good time with friends and drink. Aggieville has more than 15 bars to choose from, according to the Aggieville Business Association website, and on weekends people can be seen bar hopping and hanging outside the bars in groups. Jordan Irsik, senior in secondary education, said the atmosphere varies bar to bar in Aggieville, but overall, it is very welcoming and positive. \u201cThe people at Kansas State are all really friendly with each other,\u201d Irsik said. \u201cYou rarely have any fights or anything like that. People are usually really respectful of each other, and you\u2019re basically partying with a bunch of strangers and everyone acts like they\u2019re best friends.\u201d Irsik said he recalls great Tuesday nights in Aggieville with his friends. He and his friends would go out on Tuesday nights to take advantage of the cheaper prices and see where they would go. Where they decided to go depended on what they wanted to do each night. \u201cUsually if we\u2019re just trying to hang out, have fun, we\u2019d just go to (So Long Saloon), but if we were trying to turn up like we used to, we\u2019d go to (Johnny Kaw\u2019s Sports Bar) or somewhere like that,\u201d Irsik said. Hannah Gillespie, junior in life science, said Aggieville is a good place get groups together to forget being a student for an evening. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s always really relaxed,\u201d Gillespie said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s a place I would go and feel uncomfortable in Aggieville.\u201d Like Irsik, Gillespie\u2019s favorite bar had been Rusty\u2019s before it closed its doors last month. Aggieville has seen many changes over the years, Brett Allred, owner of Johnny Kaw\u2019s, said. Allred recently purchased Rusty\u2019s and also owns Shot Stop and Bomb Bar. Allred said a 2006 change in law made it easier for people to open bars in Aggieville. Since then, more bars have popped up, but they constantly change in the \u201cfeast-or-famine type market.\u201d \u201cThere might be two or three businesses that are really full and the others don\u2019t see much business, but because there\u2019s so many bars now, it\u2019s a lot different from 10 years ago when all the bars would be very busy,\u201d Allred said. Despite the changes that have happened and what he expects will happen, Allred said people who come to Aggieville can still expect to be entertained and safe. Many people say it is important to feel safe in Aggieville when going out. Officer Tyrone Townsend with the Riley County Police has worked to do that for over a year. He said as a police officer, he has become a part of the Aggieville community. \u201cYou see a lot of the same people, which isn\u2019t always bad,\u201d Townsend said. \u201cYou make connections with them. I think you make them feel safe, because they get to know you.\u201d Townsend said what he has seen in Aggieville is a community that takes care of its people, lighting cigarettes for each other, loaning phone chargers and making sure people get home safely. \u201cThis could go on, but obviously there is the bad stuff,\u201d Townsend said. Issues officers might handle in a night are MIP, over-intoxication, DUIs or fights. Fights typically happen around the time bars close, he said. Officers pay close attention to parking lots and other places where people might congregate, because these are places where fights might happen. \u201cObviously you\u2019ll see some of the fights,\u201d Townsend said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had in the past in some of the bars mega- mega-fights with 10 plus people. It\u2019s just a brawl, an all-out brawl \u2026 you\u2019re just trying to contain it.\u201d Despite the fights and other issues an officer might face in Aggieville, Townsend said he still likes to think of the funny moments, like the night when a man came in to report a stolen car but it had actually been repossessed. Things can get crazy in Aggieville, especially working in it, but Townsend said he appreciates the community mixed with K-State students and faculty, military and locals. House Party Culture Danielle Winchester, junior in hospitality management, said she has both attended and hosted her fair share of private parties throughout her time in college, and has concluded that a majority of Manhattan house parties have a more low-key atmosphere to them than parties in other college towns. \u201cEverybody seems to know everyone here, or if you don\u2019t know a person (at a party), you\u2019ve seen them somewhere, or you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re on the tennis team. My friend\u2019s on the tennis team,\u2019 so it all feels really connected,\u201d Winchester said. As far as how she\u2019s seen law enforcement\u2019s handling of out-of-hand house parties, Winchester said Manhattan police are reasonable and respectable. \u201cIn Manhattan, cops don\u2019t seem very rude about it,\u201d Winchester said. \u201cThey usually give a warning at first. They come in respectfully, and they tell you the truth. I know in other places, cops will lie to you to get in the house. They\u2019ll tell you they have a warrant when they don\u2019t. That doesn\u2019t seem to happen here because it\u2019s such a family-style culture and such a tight community.\u201d Winchester said she recalls allowing a stranger, who was a fellow K-State student, into one of her parties because they brought Jimmy John\u2019s to share. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t weird because everybody in Manhattan seems really nice and friendly,\u201d Winchester said. \u201cAnd I know that that\u2019s not true for everything. Sometimes parties get too wild and sometimes things go bad, but for the most part, every party I\u2019ve ever been to has been really respectful for a party. You know, K-State\u2019s a community, and we\u2019re not very big in the grand scheme of things, so everybody kind of has a connection to everybody. It\u2019s nice. It\u2019s safe.\u201d ",
