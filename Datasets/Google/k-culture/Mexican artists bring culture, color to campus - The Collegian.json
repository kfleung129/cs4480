    "text": "World-renowned, award-winning Mexican artists Agustin Cruz Prudencio and Cilau Valadez visited campus on Tuesday to put on a workshop teaching individuals about their art. \u201cK-State is a world-class university and our art education program needs to be global, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d Trina Harlow, instructor in art education, said. Harlow played an integral role in organizing the workshop by receiving a diversity grant from the Student Governing Association. \u201cI\u2019d crossed paths with these artists before and really liked what they do,\u201d Harlow said. \u201cThe high level of skill that\u2019s involved is amazing. They\u2019re brilliant.\u201d Harlow said as the world changes, there is a greater need to teach diversity to children and adults alike. \u201cA big part of my art curriculum has been multicultural projects and studying other cultures and countries and people,\u201d Harlow said. \u201cArt education is a really natural way to teach others about those things. As a teacher, I have to be really concerned about diversity.\u201d Prudencio, an Oaxacan wood carver and painter, has been making art for 19 years. \u201cI get inspiration through going to festivals and international conventions where I show my artwork,\u201d Prudencio said. \u201cI see the quality of other artists\u2019 work and push myself to improve my own work.\u201d In the morning, Prudencio goes to his workshop and starts working with machetes and knives. Eventually, he stops to eat and goes back to work. Carving a small piece might take a day, but larger pieces might take weeks or months. Valadez, a fourth-generation Huichol yarn painter, did his first piece when he was 7 years old and has been creating works of art for a living for nine years. He has a long list of commissions that he said he has to really be working on to get through. Each piece takes hours of time and focus to complete. \u201cI live near the ocean, so when my eyes get tired or I lose focus, I grab my board and surf for a few hours before getting back to work,\u201d Valadez said. Valadez said his paintings are \u201cjust like writing a poem.\u201d He gets inspiration from his culture\u2019s tradition and nature using stories and symbols to create vibrant, colorful works of art. Students were encouraged to attend the event, especially those in the education field. \u201cI think it\u2019s really cool,\u201d Rylan Laudan, sophomore in elementary education, said. \u201cThe diversity of all the different projects we are getting to do that would also be very easy for elementary students to do.\u201d Though students came to learn, it was more than just another class. \u201cIt\u2019s always fun to get to do things from other cultures and get to experience art projects outside of class and just have fun with them and be creative,\u201d Aubrey Berning, freshman in elementary education, said. Future educators like Berning will be able to use what they learned in the workshop for their future classrooms. \u201cFor social studies lessons and stuff like that, it will be really neat to get to use projects from a different culture than most of my students will probably know,\u201d Berning said. The workshop also drew art enthusiasts, young and old, from a variety of groups across the Manhattan community. \u201cI\u2019m familiar with Huichol,\u201d Enell Foerster, a member of the Manhattan Area Weavers and Spinners Guild, said. \u201cI grew up in Mexico, so I wanted to come and honor the artists and participate.\u201d While the event was a great learning opportunity for students, it was also beneficial for those who came to enjoy themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s fun and it\u2019s challenging,\u201d Foerster said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to do, challenge our artistic sense.\u201d It is Harlow\u2019s mission to broaden the spectrum of art education on campus through workshops like this one.
