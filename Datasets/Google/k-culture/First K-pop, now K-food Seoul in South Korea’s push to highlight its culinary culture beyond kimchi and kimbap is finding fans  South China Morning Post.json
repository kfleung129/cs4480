    "text": "South Korean food festival Taste of Seoul launched its third edition late last month with an awards ceremony at the Sebitseom Island convention centre in Seoul. The event, which ran from September 30 to October 6 and was organised by the Seoul Metropolitan Government, was the first citywide in-person gastronomy event of its kind since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, as much of Asia moves into a post-pandemic phase. Two previous editions were held virtually because of the pandemic. Taste of Seoul was held to promote the \u201cdiversity and differentiation of Seoul\u2019s gourmet culture\u201d. Michelin-star restaurant chefs hosted parallel events \u2013 Seoul Restaurant Week, Seoul Market Dining, Seoul March\u00e9, Seoul Food Cinema and Seoul Sool Class \u2013 to spotlight Korea\u2019s food and drinks culture. Yoshihiro Narisawa, the chef-founder of Narisawa in Tokyo, also took part in the event\u2019s Grand Gala Dinner, where he cooked with \u201cgodmother of Korean cooking\u201d Cho Hee-sook and Son Jong-won of one-Michelin-star L\u2019Amant Secret and Eatanic Garden. \u201cThe Seoul government seeks to discover the city\u2019s unique differences in cuisines and promote it both at home and abroad,\u201d says Choi Kyeng-ju, the director general of the city\u2019s tourism and sports bureau. \u201cWe want to become a global gourmet city and enhance our food tourism competitiveness.\u201d \u201cOver the last decade, Korean fine dining has increased in popularity in and outside Seoul,\u201d says Choi Jung-yoon, head chef of the Sempio Korean Fermentation Culinary Research Centre and founder of JY Tour, an online guide that highlights old Korean restaurants. Modern Korean cuisine has been making headway thanks to the chefs who serve it \u2013 look no further than the South Korean Michelin Guide for proof, says Choi, where a large proportion of stars were awarded to modern Korean restaurants. \u201cChefs Kang Min-goo and Yim Jung-sik have played a major role in the development of the Korean fine dining industry in Seoul,\u201d she says of the chefs behind two-Michelin-star restaurants Mingles and Jungsik, respectively. In the last 10 years, however, Seoul\u2019s dining scene has been quietly evolving to encompass more than that. According to Choi, the fine-dining set in Seoul is skewing \u201cyounger and more dynamic\u201d and is drawn to traditional Korean cuisine and Korean barbecue omakase. \u201cYounger Korean chefs are becoming more interested in the authenticity of traditional cuisine [and] more are exploring temple cuisine and fermentation techniques,\u201d she says. Cho Eun-hee, an executive chef of one-Michelin-star traditional Korean restaurant Onjium, agrees. Onjium was one of seven winners in the Korean cuisine category in the Taste of Seoul awards. \u201cI think the younger demographic are now embracing traditional Korean food,\u201d says Cho. \u201cFor them, it is something new and exotic rather than old, and so it comes across as trendy.\u201d Cho \u2013 who has more than 30 years of experience in traditional Korean cuisine \u2013 says there is still a dearth of traditional Korean dining in Seoul, although she believes \u201cthe numbers will grow fast thanks to the attention and love showered on traditional fare from the younger generation\u201d. In 2013, Cho opened Onjium as a one-table dining room serving traditional Korean cuisine and dedicated to studying and sharing Korean cultural heritage. Cho and co-executive chef Park Sung-bae travelled across the country for two years before Onjium\u2019s debut, researching Korean heritage food and ingredients. In 2018, Onjium became a 25-seat food studio \u2013 as well as a housing studio and a clothing studio. In a building formerly occupied by United Nations cultural agency Unicef, it became a part of a non-profit research institution that preserves Korean traditions. The chefs make their own Korean sauces, such as ganjang (soy sauce), doenjang (soybean paste) and gochujang (red pepper paste), and they brew their own liquors for the restaurant\u2019s traditional Korean alcoholic pairing menu. They also work closely with farmers to change the way rice crops are planted to improve the quality of harvested rice. In 2014, chef Kwon Woo-joong opened Kwonsooksoo, which went on to win two Michelin stars in 2017. 7th Door by chef Kim Dae-chun, of contemporary Seoul restaurant Toc Toc, debuted in 2020 and uses traditional techniques of ageing and fermentation. Just this year, Park Ju-eun, the former head chef of the now defunct Hansikgonggan, welcomed diners to his newly opened traditional Korean fine diner, Restaurant Jueun, near the Gyeonghuigung Palace \u2013 one of the five royal palaces in Seoul. According to Park, vegetarian recipes flourished during the Goryeo dynasty (918\u20131392) because Buddhism \u2013 which prohibits taking the life of any person or animal \u2013 was deeply rooted in society. Despite its reputation as a meat-loving society, Park says that Koreans used to eat a wide variety of vegetables with seasonings such as soy sauce and soybean paste. During my stay in Seoul I met chef Kim Dae-chun, who took us to the 115-year-old Jingwansa Temple in Bukhansan National Park. The Korean chef, himself a diligent student of temple cuisine, is two months into a vegan diet and has a deep interest in learning about how temple food heals the body and soul. Jingwansa Temple, he says, was a favourite for Korean royals, and its temple cuisine remains well regarded. \u201cBy chance, I had the opportunity to [try] the food of Jingwansa and it was revolutionary,\u201d says Kim, who has been a chef for more than 20 years. \u201cIf Korea still had a monarch, he\u2019d be eating food like the temple cuisine of Jingwansa.\u201d It will be more than just a restaurant, though, says Kim \u2013 it will be a space where guests can seek inner healing.
