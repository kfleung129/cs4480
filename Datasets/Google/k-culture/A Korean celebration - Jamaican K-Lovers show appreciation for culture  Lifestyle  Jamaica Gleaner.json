    "text": "It was a Jamaica-Korea link-up on Monday night, as alumni of Korea International Corporation Agency (KOICA) and members of Love Korea gathered to celebrate with one of independent Jamaica's longest diplomatic partners. The newly opened Korean restaurant, Arirang, at 7th Avenue Plaza, was the base for the reunion and celebration. To date, more than 100 Jamaicans have benefited from the KOICA, whose mandate is to maximise the effectiveness of Korea's grant aid programmes. Last year, 12 Jamaicans participated in the renewable energy training course, and this year, four Jamaicans went to Korea as part of the programme. 'K-Lovers' is the name given to Jamaican fans of Korean culture, and they were on hand to enjoy some scrumptious Korean dishes, until the real party began in the form of a talent competition. Everything Korean was fair game, from Korean karaoke, to anime drawings and violin playing. The smiles and chatter among those present proved that they had a good time celebrating everything Korean.   View the discussion thread. ",
