    "text": "Songs don\u2019t get much more offensive than Lil Dicky\u2019s \u201cKorea,\u201d which made its debut on the rapper\u2019s FXX sitcom Dave on June 16. The song\u2019s music video shows him defecating in the middle of downtown Seoul and dancing cheesily with a group of women who spin Korean flag umbrellas, as a vaguely Asian flute whistles in the background. But the scene\u2019s tastelessness is intentional. In Dave, the comedian and rapper born Dave Burd plays an exaggeratedly clueless version of himself as a way to make sharp observations about the absurdities embedded in pop culture, race and millennial relationships. In the show\u2019s latest episode, Burd\u2019s character sets his sights on conquering the K-pop industry. Along the way, he exemplifies the craven attitude that some American superstars and labels have taken in scrambling to grab a piece of a rapidly growing market share. \u201cEvery single song that comes out of this country gets like 5 million, billion views in a day,\u201d Dave explains to his perturbed intern Dan. He\u2019s determined to capitalize on the popularity of K-pop. \u201cIt\u2019s the best idea I\u2019ve ever had\u2014it\u2019s a cheat code.\u201d Burd\u2019s character epitomizes the exact way not to approach K-pop. Yet the episode\u2014written by Lee Sung Jin and featuring an extensive cameo from the K-pop megastar CL\u2014is actually the product of a meticulous cross-cultural collaboration emphasizing sensitivity and attention to detail. \u201cHe was very aware\u2014he did his homework and studied everything,\u201d CL says of Burd\u2019s approach to getting K-pop culture right. \u201cI think this episode is putting a stamp to Western culture that K-pop existed when we look back.\u201d Over the past few years, K-pop\u2019s global success has reached the point that Western superstars\u2014 from Halsey to Lady Gaga to Diplo\u2014 have crossed over in the other direction to appear on K-pop songs. Burd hoped to make fun of this trend by creating a K-pop knockoff song that blatantly treated the genre as a marketing strategy as opposed to an autonomous culture. (\u201cI got kimchi, I got it all\u2026 Kimbap that ass on the wall,\u201d goes one of his inane lyrics on \u201cKorea.\u201d) To do so, Burd tapped Lee, a Dave writer and co-executive producer, to build an episode out of the concept. Lee spent his childhood in Korea and is a self-professed huge K-pop fan; he remembers growing up on artists such as Seo Taiji and the Boys, H.O.T. and Fin.K.L. While Lee drew on his own wealth of cultural knowledge, he also conducted research by interviewing several K-pop artists and executives, who highlighted two key trends with regards to working with Western artists: \u201cWe found there were a lot of people either leeching off K-pop\u2019s momentum or finding ways to hate on it,\u201d Lee says. Burd and Lee then laid out an episode that would explore both sides, with the song \u201cKorea\u201d exemplifying the first part\u2014the leeching. The second part of this dynamic is revealed midway through the episode, as Dave and his team jump to conclusions about \u201cthe dark side of K-pop\u201d and the ways in which K-pop artists like CL, who plays herself, might be controlled by their managers or even the mob. It\u2019s a canny parody of how Western media has focused on these concerns amid claims that K-pop stars are forbidden to date, have grueling training schedules, and face exacting pressure from their labels and rabid fans alike. Over the past few years, several K-pop idols, including Sulli, Goo Hara and Jonghyun, have committed suicide. Yet these topics are thorny not just for their subject matter, but also because K-pop fans on social media are fiercely loyal; they\u2019ve been known to use their collective power to shout down media they feel portrays K-pop in an unfair light. Some Western outlets now avoid these topics altogether for fear of incurring the ire of fandoms so organized, they famously derailed a Trump rally in 2020. Ultimately, the Dave team decided it was important to talk about both sides of the K-pop phenomenon. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to ignore subjects out of fear, because how will we ever actually examine them together?\u201d Lee says. \u201cThere\u2019s always danger in this Twitter age that things will be taken out of context. We had a constant discussion of what our intention is and how to walk that line. Ultimately, it is a love letter to K-pop.\u201d \u201cIf you want to address something that is rarely addressed, you need to take the risk,\u201d CL says. \u201cI would like to tell my fans and whoever\u2019s watching it to look at it with more layers.\u201d Lee wasn\u2019t involved in Dave\u2019s first season, and at first, he says he was skeptical of the show based on its billboards, in which Burd appeared as a phallic symbol. But last year, Lee got a text from the actor Steven Yeun, who stars in Lee\u2019s upcoming Netflix series Beef. \u201cHe said, \u2018You have to watch\u2014it\u2019s my favorite sitcom out,\u2019\u201d Lee recalls. \u201cI finished it in a couple days, and my mind was blown. Every step of the way bent my expectations.\u201d Lee says he\u2019s had a similarly positive experience in the writers room, especially compared to his experiences over the last decade: he says Hollywood has had a knack for disempowering young writers of color, and using them as shields for criticism even if their ideas are discarded by the final draft. \u201cThere\u2019s always the worry you\u2019re gonna write something and it\u2019s gonna turn into something else somewhere in the pipeline,\u201d he says. But Dave, he says, had the most number of Asian writers out of any writers room he\u2019s ever worked in, which led to different kinds of discussions and characters\u2014and Burd gave him creative power every step of the way. \u201cFrom writing to shooting to editing, he\u2019s made me feel super involved in every microdecision,\u201d Lee says. \u201cThat makes you feel like it\u2019s also your show, which makes a huge difference.\u201d CL says she was more than happy to fly from Korea to Los Angeles\u2014which, ironically, subbed in for Seoul due to COVID protocols\u2014to be a part of the episode. (It also probably didn\u2019t hurt that CL and Dave share a professional link: CL is backed by management from Scooter Braun\u2019s SB Projects, who serves as an executive producer on Dave). \u201cIt\u2019s one of my biggest passions to represent K-pop, and I\u2019m a big fan of his show,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was definitely worth the two-week quarantine.\u201d Contact us at letters@time.com.
