Williams, the actor best known for playing Omar Little, on \u201cThe Wire,\u201d sat under lights and a parabolic umbrella, holding a vape pen, his elbows on his knees. He looked concerned. Joey L., crouching, took photographs. \u201cNeed a Way Out,\u201d by Maino, played. Williams wore his own clothes: a gray Valentino sports coat, black leather Yves Saint Laurent biker pants with elaborately zippered knees (\u201cI keep \u2019em open, get the little breeze,\u201d he said later), and black-and-white Rick Owens zippered high-tops. \u201cWe gave him notes: something super simple. Classic,\u201d Molly Kaplan, a multimedia producer for the A.C.L.U., said. Williams is the A.C.L.U.\u2019s new ambassador for ending mass incarceration, and the photographs from the session will be used in an upcoming ad campaign advocating reform of the criminal-justice system. The crew took a break\u2014the next shots would be outside, on a fire escape\u2014and Williams stood up and danced a little. \u201cTears of Joy,\u201d by Rick Ross, played. (\u201cTell me, Lord, will I be dealing dope? I want to take my mama to the Poconos.\u201d) Williams plays Rick Ross\u2019s namesake, the eighties drug dealer Rick Ross, in the recent movie \u201cKill the Messenger.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s become a very good friend of mine,\u201d Williams said, of the real Rick Ross. \u201cHe\u2019s not what we might think a drug dealer might be, which is this menacing, coldhearted, callous killer. He\u2019s actually mild-mannered, kind, sensitive, friendly, warm. He had aspirations of becoming a tennis player.\u201d Williams grew up in a housing project in East Flatbush. He has relatives who have done time for drug offenses, and he has been an addict himself. \u201cArresting people, or ruining people\u2019s lives for a small, nonviolent charge, like marijuana, drug addiction, or mental illness, is not the way to go,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are health issues, not criminal issues. It\u2019s the grace of God that I wasn\u2019t imprisoned for my antics growing up.\u201d Link copied \u201cYou\u2019re da Man,\u201d by Nas, came on. \u201cI love Nas,\u201d Williams said, moving to the beat. \u201cHe gets me in my A.C.L.U. state of mind.\u201d Williams started out as a dancer. When he was twenty-five, his face was slashed in a bar fight. He began to be cast in tough-guy roles, and worked with Tupac Shakur and Martin Scorsese. In 2002, he was cast on \u201cThe Wire\u201d as Omar\u2014a gay, principled, \u201cFarmer in the Dell\u201d-whistling Robin Hood figure who makes his living robbing drug dealers. Barack Obama called Omar his favorite character on his favorite TV show. \u201cOmar was life-changing for me,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI went so deep into his psyche that the lines of reality as to who was Michael and who was Omar got blurred.\u201d An assistant brought him a brownie, which he ate with a spoon. \u201cI had low self-esteem,\u201d he said. \u201cI was, like, Mike is corny! I\u2019m gonna be this Omar dude. It was like that was my Spider-Man suit. Peter Parker was the corny kid in glasses, but he put that Spider-Man suit on, it was on and poppin\u2019.\u201d After the role ended, he said, his addiction \u201ckicked back up again.\u201d But he made it out, with \u201ctime, healing, meditation. A little therapy\u2014never hurt nobody.\u201d Williams now lives in Williamsburg. \u201cI\u2019m a huge fan of how beautiful Brooklyn has become, but I do have an issue with the gentrification,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel grateful that I\u2019ve got a second chance at life, to be able to afford to live the way I do, coming from where I come from.\u201d He paused. \u201cIf anybody should live here, it should be me,\u201d he said, and laughed. But it feels \u201ca little lonely.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see a lot of blacks in Williamsburg at all,\u201d he went on. \u201cSometimes, when I see, you know, antics on the weekend, I\u2019d feel safer in the Vanderveer projects, where I grew up. I understand that kind of crazy. When I see the people in Williamsburg get crazy, I\u2019m, like, O.K., where\u2019s this going? If they were black, the police would probably be pouncing on them. I kind of just go in the house.\u201d In his next role, on a new HBO miniseries, \u201cCrime,\u201d he plays an inmate. His character, Freddy, \u201cruns Rikers Island,\u201d the notoriously grim city jail. \u201cMass incarceration, there we go again,\u201d he said. The ad campaign begins this spring, but Williams\u2019s role is already under way: shortly after the Ferguson grand jury failed to indict the police officer who killed Michael Brown, the A.C.L.U. tweeted an image of Williams urging trust-building \u201cbetween police and the communities they\u2019re sworn to protect.\u201d Last Wednesday, Williams e-mailed further thoughts. \u201cMike Brown\u2019s death is a request for us to look at the young men in Ferguson and places like it with humanity and have our local governments and courts do the same,\u201d he wrote. Later that day, a grand jury in Staten Island failed to indict the officer who killed Eric Garner.\u00a0\u2666 By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.
