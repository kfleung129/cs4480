    "text": " Hanwha Chemical announced on March 22 that it succeeded in developing high value-added chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC), which has the improved heat and corrosion resistance, with its domestic technology. Since CPVC has a high technology entry barrier, it has been entirely imported until now. Accordingly, Hanwha Chemical has become the first company in the nation that succeeds in domestically producing CPVC. The company recently completed the detailed design and started construction of the production lines with annual capacity of 30,000 tons at the second plant located in Ulsan Petrochemical Industrial Complex, and it will complete the construction by the end of this year. CPVC has 10 percent more chlorine than existing polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and is very resistant to heat, pressure and corrosion. It is used in producing pipes for fire sprinkler systems, hot water and special pipes for industrial use. The CPVC market reached 250,000 tons as of last year and is growing 10 percent every year. Only a few companies, such as Lubrizol in the U.S. and Sekisui and Kaneka in Japan, currently produce CPVC and about 9,000 tons of CPVC was imported to Korea last year. The profitability of PVC, which is for general purpose, is worsening as China, the largest market in the world, has raised the self-sufficiency rates, the global economy is showing a downturn and low-priced products have appeared in the market. In a bid to secure the competitiveness in the global market, a strategy to increase the added value of universal products is needed. Starting with CPVC, Hanwha Chemical is now developing technologies to improve functions and added value of various universal products, including polyethylene (PE) and plasticizer. In addition, the company is planning to lower the dependence on ethylene and diversify its business portfolio by developing products made of various oils. Never miss another article!
