    "text": "Hong Kong has long been considered one of East Asia\u2019s most thriving financial and cultural hubs, thanks to its successful stock exchange, world-class food scene, and recent art boom. In 2017, CNN Travel even considered it to be the world\u2019s greatest city. Over the past few decades, Hong Kong has established itself in the entertainment industry and has developed a unique cultural identity that transcends borders. The city has produced famous international film stars like Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee, and in the early 1990s, it produced an average of 400 movies per year. Its homegrown Cantopop music earned international acclaim and peaked in the mid-1990s. Its colonial past has made it a cultural fault line for Westerners, successfully blending Cantonese tradition with modern achievement. But its cultural vibrancy has started to dim under Chinese sovereignty, which has fostered an environment of growing political unrest, particularly over the last decade. In 2014, Hong Kong saw widespread pro-democracy protests, referred to as the Umbrella Revolution, in response to Chinese encroachment. Pro-democracy demonstrations have exploded sporadically over the past few years as China extends its political reach into Hong Kong\u2014in 2019, protests erupted over a proposed extradition bill, and most recently, anger has mounted over a new national security law that has been used to crackdown on dissent. As political uncertainty grips Hong Kong, businesses, ex-pats, and creatives have begun to shift their focus elsewhere in Asia. Last month, The New York Times officially announced the relocation of its Hong Kong-based digital team to Seoul, citing the new national security law. Major global tech companies also reacted harshly to the new law, and short-form Gen-Z video titan TikTok announced it would cease operations in Hong Kong altogether. High-net worth investors have started mapping out their exit strategies, and on Wednesday, August 19, the U.S. officially suspended or terminated three bilateral agreements with Hong Kong, including certain reciprocal tax exemptions. As Hong Kong continues to deal with the fallout from the new national security law, forward-looking experts say South Korea may experience economic and cultural gain. \u201cUndoubtedly there will be movements of personnel, especially in mass media,\u201d John Lie, professor of sociology at the University of Berkeley, told VICE News. \u201cAnd [South Korea] would very much like to be a major hub in East Asia.\u201d Some of South Korea\u2019s current success resides in its pop-culture empire. As Professor Lie highlights: \u201cThe attractiveness of the country is now bound up with the Korean Wave, also known as Hallyu, especially K-pop and K-dramas, and a sense of coolness.\u201d South Korea has managed to leverage its pop-culture as a diplomatic tool. In 2019, South Korea\u2019s soft power was ranked 19th in the world and the second in Asia, according to Soft Power 30, the annual index published by Portland Communications and the USC Center on Public Diplomacy. 2020 has shown more than ever the success of the \u201cKorean Wave.\u201d Bong Joon-ho\u2019s Parasite won the Oscar for Best Picture\u2014the first foreign-language film ever to do so. Dozens of K-dramas were released, and the enormously popular K-pop band BTS released a new album, which, according to Forbes, was the bestselling album worldwide this year. In total, public diplomacy group The Korea Foundation estimated that there were almost 100 million consumers of K-culture scattered across 113 countries in 2019. \u201cIn these times, having such a big fanbase is crucial,\u201d Wantanee Suntikul, assistant professor at the School of Hotel and Tourism Management at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, told VICE News. \u201cSoft power talks to people by people. It is much more powerful nowadays because very few people still fully trust their government,\u201d she explained. Suntikul noted that Korean pop idols BTS are at the forefront of South Korea\u2019s cultural drive. \u201cBTS is South Korea\u2019s national treasure,\u201d she explained.

BTS-mania has also brought a tourism boost to South Korea. \u201cIt's all about breathing the same air as the idols, and feeling closer to them,\u201d Suntikul said. \u201cThis growth is obviously not only thanks to them, but they highly contributed to make South Korea cooler than ever.\u201d South Korea registered a record number of around 17.5 million inbound visitors last year, an increase of 14 percent from 2018. \u00a0The state-run Korea Tourism Organization estimated that foreigners who traveled to the country to consume K-pop goods were spending an average of $1,007. In 2019, there were about 160,000 foreign students enrolled in South Korean higher education institutions, a continued increase from the year prior. South Korea\u2019s cultural expansion has also helped boost its business profile. \u201cObviously K-culture helps to attract foreign business,\u201d Hye Jin Lee, an assistant professor at the USC Annenberg School for communication and journalism, told VICE News. She explained that the attractiveness of South Korea resides in its geographical location, as well as in the stability of its governance. \u201cSouth Korea\u2019s government has proved its ability to manage crises over the past few decades: with North Korea, with the protests that lead to the impeachment of former President Park Guen-hye in 2016, and now with its strategies to contain COVID-19.\u201d \u201cOur economy has remained stable and that\u2019s why businesses want to relocate there,\u201d she added. According to a report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) released earlier this month, South Korea\u2019s economy is projected to take the smallest hit from the coronavirus pandemic. According to the report, its GDP will fall by just 0.8 percent in 2020, compared to the global average decline of 7.5 percent. \u201cSouth Korea also became a symbol of democracy in Asia, of peaceful protesting and of freedom of speech,\u201d Lee added. \u201cIt gives a lot of confidence to foreign companies to relocate to South Korea. Compared to what\u2019s happening in Hong Kong, the difference is striking\u201d.
