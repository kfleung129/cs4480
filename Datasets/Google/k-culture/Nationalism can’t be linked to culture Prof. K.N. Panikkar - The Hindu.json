Panikkar delivering the fourth memorial lecture in remembrance of noted industrialist Chukkapalli Pitchaiah in Vijayawada on Monday. \u2014Photo: V. Raju The concept of nationalism is a 19th century phenomenon and it can\u2019t be linked to specific culture or certain customs and traditions of a particular religion, according to former JNU faculty historian and author Prof. K.N. Panikkar. Delivering a lecture on \u2018Nationality and Different Perspectives\u2019, organised by Chukkapalli Pitchaiah Foundation in Vijayawada, he said there cannot be social, cultural or economic nationalism. Prof. Panikkar was speaking on \u2018Nationality and Different Perspectives\u2019, as part of the memorial lecture organised by Chukkapalli Pitchaiah Foundation here. On the occasion, Prof. Panikkar was presented with the fourth Chukkapalli Pitchaiah Foundation award, Rs 2 lakh cash prize and a citation marking the 88th birth anniversary of the late industrialist and humanitarian. Several kinds of nationalism \u201cOur generation had seen the nationalism which was defined as anything that opposes the British Raj. The unifying force was the anti-colonial thought and nothing else. But now we hear about several kinds of nationalism based on religion, region and culture. Such things were the order of the day in countries like Germany during Hitler\u2019s era. Similar things are happening in this country today,\u201d he said. Nationalism has historicity and it has so much to do with struggle for independence and post independence reforms, according to him. One cannot think of achieving nationalism through ideologies and hegemonies associated with one religion or culture in a multi-cultural society in India, he said. Prof. Panikkar said the historical conceptualisation of nationalism by the majority population, i.e., Hindus, needs to be rationalised. The definition of nationalism needs to be understood in the context of factors that unite a wide variety of groups within the country. Dynamic concept Nationalism is a dynamic concept and it has to be rediscovered and re-evaluated from time to time. The national ideologies that existed in the pre-colonial era were completely different from the one that emerged during freedom struggle. The Mughal period and the ones preceding them had different concepts of nationalism altogether, he said. \u2018Arrest pseudo-nationalist ideologies\u2019 Speaking on the occasion, retired professor of History from University of Hyderabad Prof. V. Ramakrishna, who moderated the session, said the country\u2019s leadership should arrest such pseudo-nationalist ideologies from spreading to dangerous proportions. \u201cSuch false ideologies should be controlled from the beginning. People at the helm, who are responsible for ensuring harmony in the country, should not keep quiet and should act before it\u2019s too late,\u201d Prof. Ramakrishna said.
