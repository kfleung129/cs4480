The \u2018Product Design\u2019 prize makes the XCeed the fourth member of the Ceed model family to receive a Red Dot prize.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe XCeed\u2019s accolade brings Kia\u2019s total number of Red Dot awards to 25, since the brand won its first in 2009. Most recently in 2019, the XCeed\u2019s stablemates \u2013 the Ceed, Ceed Sportswagon and ProCeed \u2013 were each individually recognized for their design strengths by the prestigious awards program.\r\n\u00a0\r\nKarim Habib, head of Kia Design Center, said, \u201cKia has strived for continuous quality improvements and more fascinating and interesting customer experiences. Kia\u2019s crossover XCeed represents this new vision.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nThis is the second major design prize for the XCeed and the full Ceed model family, following an iF Award for the new model at the beginning of 2020. The XCeed also received the prestigious \u2018Golden Steering Wheel\u2019 (Das Goldene Lenkrad) in Germany in 2019, and won the Urban Car Award in last year\u2019s Women\u2019s World Car of the Year contest.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe Kia XCeed is a new urban crossover utility vehicle (CUV) which combines compact SUV practicality with the sporty packaging and engaging handling of a hatchback. It addresses the growing desire among European drivers for cars which offer more emotion and dynamism than an SUV, both in terms of the way they look and drive.\r\n\u00a0\r\nDesigned as a sporty alternative to a traditional SUV, the new CUV\u00a0offers comparable levels of space for occupants and luggage, the company says. The car engages drivers with its sporty handling and comfortable, assured ride, while providing a more commanding view of the road ahead than a conventional hatchback.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe car has been designed exclusively for European customers at Kia\u2019s European design studio in Frankfurt, Germany. It went on-sale in Europe in the second half of 2019, with more than 20,000 examples sold to-date. A new electrified variant of the car, the XCeed Plug-in Hybrid, was launched in the first quarter of 2020. Never miss another article!
