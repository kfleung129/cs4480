Being the third technology export for GX-I7, the deal boosted the total value of the contracts on the drug to about 2 trillion won. Genexine announced on Feb. 18 that it has lincensed out GX-I7 technology to KG Bio, a subsidiary of Indonesian pharmaceutical company Kalbe Farma. The down payment is US$27 million. Genexine will be able to receive up to US$1.1 billion through milestones. On top of that, it will receive 10 percent royalties when GX-I7's sales occur in areas specified in the contract. The areas include the ASEAN, the Middle East, Australia, and New Zealand. GX-I7 helps activate T cells responsible for the body's immunity. Currently, Genexine is carrying out a second phase clinical trial of GX-I7 in Indonesia with KG Bio to check its efficacy in treating COVID-19 patients. Once proven to be effective, KG Bio will apply for emergency approval for GX-17 as a COVID-19 treatment to Indonesian public authorities. Genexine previously signed a total of 1.814 trillion won worth of GX-17 technology exports. In May 2016, the company handed over sales rights to the drug in Europe and the United States to NeoImmunTech for US$12.5 million. After GX-17 is developed as a treatment, Genexine will receive about 35 percent of its sales in royalties. Never miss another article!
