American devotees of Korean pop music have taken over Newark\u2019s Prudential Center for the weekend; in the parking lot, the crowd sings along to a series of Korean-pop hooks by groups like Exo, Red Velvet and BTS, whose arena-rock stomper \u201cFake Love\u201d gets the loudest shouts. Close by, a teenage dance group teaches signature moves from K-pop music videos; other stages in the complex host songwriter meet-and-greets, beauty tutorials and panels like \u201cMeeting Idols in Korea: Reality vs. Expectation.\u201d (\u201cManners in Korea are taken very seriously,\u201d advises the moderator, a K-pop blogger named Whitneybae. \u201cRookie groups are respectful, shaking your hand and bowing 90 degrees. But more veteran idols will give you a \u2018what\u2019s up?\u2019 \u2014 trying to greet you in a friendlier, more \u2018American\u2019 way.\u201d) When the event, Kcon, was first held in the U.S. in 2012, it drew a few hundred fans and curious locals. That number has since swelled to more than 125,000, divided between conventions on both coasts. \u201cThe chanting was so loud last time that mainstream music industry people told me they\u2019d never heard the roof blown off like that before,\u201d says organizer Angela Killoren. The event\u2019s popularity coincides with the worldwide explosion of K-pop, which has swelled in the past five years from a niche genre to a $5 billion global industry. K-pop\u2019s takeover of the West will be cemented on October 6th,\u00a0when the seven-member Seoul crew BTS becomes the first Korean group to play a U.S. stadium, at New York\u2019s Citi Field. The show, which sold out in minutes, follows the success of the group\u2019s hit \u201cFake Love,\u201d which debuted at Number 10 on Billboard\u2019s U.S. Hot 100 in June and racked up more than 35 million YouTube views in its first 24 hours, surpassing Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cLook What You Made Me Do.\u201d BTS\u2019 LP Love Yourself: Tear,\u00a0released in May, debuted at Number One on the Billboard 200, moving 135,000 copies in its first week.

In June, the quartet Blackpink scored the highest-charting U.S. single debut for a Korean girl group when their \u201cDdu-Du Ddu-Du\u201d entered the charts at No. 55. Super Junior, a 12-member Korean group, currently have a Latin hit with \u201cLo Siento,\u201d which is sung in both Korean and Spanish \u2013\u00a0and has more than 37 million YouTube views. \u201cSomebody always has to be the one to walk down that path and cut through the jungle and make some noise, and I think that group [was] BTS,\u201d says Phil Becker, vice president for content at Alpha Media, which owns 68 U.S. radio stations. \u201cI think six months from now we\u2019re going to be talking about some of the biggest mainstream U.S. artists in the world infusing themselves into K-pop records.\u201d Korean pop music first cracked the U.S. in 2012, when Psy\u2019s \u201cGangnam Style\u201d \u2014 a supercharged beat paired with outrageously stylized visuals \u2014 became the first video to top a billion streams on YouTube. But most K-pop fanatics today see that song as a one-off gimmick. \u201c\u2018Gangnam Style\u2019 was an anomaly,\u201d says Killoren. \u201cThe dynamics were Internet-meme-driven, like \u2018oh, look at this.\u2019\u201d Other label efforts to expand the genre worldwide fizzled; the nine-member Girls Generation launched a marketing campaign for their Interscope Records debut in 2011, but it \u201cjust didn\u2019t work out,\u201d says one industry vet. Before that, Wonder Girls went on tour opening for the Jonas Brothers, but failed to score a hit. Claude Kelly, who has written for Bruno Mars and One Direction as well as for Girls Generation, wondered why K-pop wasn\u2019t breaking through: \u201cThe pop over there [in Korea] has always been so Michael Jackson-esque in its size. They don\u2019t hold back on production and money and rehearsal and stuff, so I\u2019ve always been like, why isn\u2019t all this big-budget show business shit really making a dent in American culture the way it should?\u201d  The answer may be that those groups tried too hard and too soon to appeal to a global audience. Both Wonder Girls and Girls Generation recorded English-language versions of their hits, which failed to take off. BTS, meanwhile, have continued singing in Korean while embracing Western pop in other ways. \u201cThe music of \u2018Fake Love\u2019 was so good that you can listen to it and like it and not even care about the lyrics,\u201d says Leslie Whittle, radio program director at Houston\u2019s KRBE. BTS\u2019 first Top 10 album, last year\u2019s\u00a0Love Yourself: Her,\u00a0featured songs written with the Chainsmokers. The group has since released collaborations with Steve Aoki, Zedd and Ali Tamposi (who co-wrote Camila Cabello\u2019s \u201cHavana\u201d and Kelly Clarkson\u2019s \u201cStronger\u201d).

The feeling K-pop leaves you with is upbeat and positive,\u201d says Whittle.\u00a0\u201cKorean pop music likes differentiation and changes,\u201d says songwriter Rodnae \u201cChikk\u201d Bell. \u201cThe average American song is four melodies, maybe five. The average K-pop song is eight to 10. They are also very heavy in the harmonies.\u201d That\u2019s good news for American R&B hitmakers, some of whom have been frustrated to see the U.S. turn away from their genre and toward loops and minimalist melodies to keep pace with hip-hop. Teddy Riley (Blackstreet, Keith Sweat) and Harvey Mason Jr. (Mario, Toni Braxton) have found new careers overseas conjuring Nineties-era R&B. \u201cWe\u2019re having this thing now where we are literally being reintroduced to our own stuff,\u201d says Kelly. K-pop acts, he continues, are like, \u201cHey, this is the shit that you did that was dope, and we still love it.\u201d  Aoki points out that the K-pop revolution likely wouldn\u2019t have happened without the streaming revolution: \u201cWith streaming, fans now have such a large voice, and that\u2019s how BTS really became a phenomenon \u2014 because the fans made it a phenomenon, like with the underground culture of punk and hardcore,\u201d the DJ says. \u201cThese guys just crush it. And I think because the fans are making such a big deal, it\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d On Soompi, one of the biggest online K-pop communities, active since 1998, the vast majority of fans are not Korean (the same goes for Kcon\u2019s attendees.) But its users \u2014 22 million and growing fast \u2014 spend hours translating lyrics and analyzing K-pop\u2019s notoriously intricate music videos, which are crammed full of plots including but not limited to murder, familial betrayal, dream sequences, heartbreak and time travel. \u201cA lot of it is very visual,\u201d says Kristine Ortiz, a community manager at the company that owns Soompi. \u201cThey\u2019re able to create a sensory experience through clothes and music videos with elaborate story lines. That\u2019s not seen a lot in Western music.\u201d The fans who do understand the language decode interviews with artists. Language isn\u2019t so much a barrier as it is a point of entry: \u201cIn Korea, it\u2019s already a part of the culture, and they speak the same language,\u201d says Ortiz.\u00a0\u201cIn the U.S., it\u2019s a process of self-discovery and that makes it really exciting for fans. Users find one song and they start digging on their own. There\u2019s a level of motivation and socializing you don\u2019t see with American artists.\u201d Some fans, she says, even wind up learning Korean as a result.  Soompi\u2019s users skew young and female. When BTS arrived in Los Angeles last year to make K-pop\u2019s first performance at the American Music Awards, the group was greeted by a riotous British Invasion-like crowd. \u201cBoy bands and girl bands are as old as the Beatles, and this is part of the history of music in general,\u201d Killoren says, adding that K-pop is tapping into a \u201ccontinual hunger.\u201d Despite the record-shattering success of BTS, radio remains largely hesitant about putting K-pop into rotation. Alpha Media\u2019s Becker says his radio company is hard at work researching where \u2014 and how \u2014 to change that. \u201cPeople often dismiss things because they\u2019re not primarily in English,\u201d he says. \u201cThe challenge I present back is, if last year\u2019s most-played song was \u2018Despacito,\u2019 why can\u2019t we play more songs not in English?\u201d (Earlier this year, \u201cDespacito,\u201d became the first Latin-pop song to be certified diamond and earn more than a billion streams on Spotify.) Still, the U.S. is not the genre\u2019s only target, as the K-pop/Latin crossover success of Super Junior proved. \u201cListeners are beginning to really expect us to look globally,\u201d says Whittle. \u201cWe, as programmers, are becoming more aware of the fact that the world is a much smaller place than it used to be.\u201d Additional reporting by Elias Leight   We want to hear it.
