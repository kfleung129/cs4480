    "text": "With its show-business staging of Mozart\u2019s \u201cThe Magic Flute\u201d as a cheekily animated silent movie, Los Angeles Opera on Saturday night got what it very much needs. That this will be a hit goes without saying. But what this once pioneering company really needs right now is a reason to be talked about again. So let\u2019s talk about Barrie Kosky, one of the hot directors on the international scene and, like most hot directors on the international scene, ignored in America. Not too many American opera companies dare hire directors who put buckets of excrement onstage, as Kosky did in a recent German production of Jan\u00e1cek\u2019s \u201cFrom the House of the Dead.\u201d Don\u2019t expect the Metropolitan Opera to call on the outspoken Australian director any time soon. In the current issue of Opera magazine, he calls the Met\u2019s \u201cLive in HD\u201d \u201crepulsive and fake,\u201d dismissing the company\u2019s popular movie theater broadcasts as \u201cspectacle, schmecktacle.\u201d VIDEO: Backstage with \u2018The Magic Flute\u2019 Not that L.A. Opera is taking any chances with Kosky\u2019s U.S. debut. He turns \u201cFlute\u201d into a dazzling live-action cartoon far too adorable to offend. Go ahead and bring the kiddies. The Dorothy Chandler stage becomes a cinema. A large screen on which animation is projected has various cutout doors and platforms for the characters to pop in and out. Rather than projected opera, Met style, Kosky\u2019s idea is projected animation as living theater. And with a cast that has effectively learned its carefully choreographed moves, the concept works brilliantly. Attacked by a serpent at the start of the opera, Tamino really is swallowed by the beast, tumbling into a comic-book stomach, surrounded by comic-book intestines and miscellaneous yet-to-be-digested junk. The audience laughed hysterically. PHOTOS: LA Opera\u2019s \u2018Magic Flute\u2019 Much else is funny as well, as Mozart meant his opera to be, even if Kosky ultimately turns just about everything into a joke. Some characters become specific silent film personas, and that pretty much works. Papageno, the bird catcher, is Buster Keaton, though not as sad-faced. Pamina, whom Tamino pursues, is Louise Brooks in her Lulu haircut. Monostatos, the mean Moor, is Nosferatu. Kosky replaces the opera\u2019s sometimes-tedious spoken dialogue with silent movie intertitles. They are accompanied by excerpts from Mozart\u2019s C-minor and F-minor keyboard fantasies on a period hammerklavier rudely yet delightfully amplified to resemble a barrel-house upright. For all the fun, Kosky\u2019s \u201cMagic Flute\u201d also has a subversive context. The production comes from the Komische Oper, the avant-garde and typically controversial Berlin company that Kosky has headed since last year. In addition, he collaborates with a young British theater company, 1927 (named for the year \u201cThe Jazz Singer\u201d ushered in the talkies), that mixes theater, music and animation. All of this is clearly poking fun at the spiritual reverence with which Berliners hold \u201cFlute.\u201d The first great recording of the opera was a glowing account by the Berlin Philharmonic under British conductor Thomas Beecham in 1937. Just last month, the Berlin Philharmonic released a new recording of the opera, on DVD. It is led by Simon Rattle, who is quoted on the jacket as saying, \u201cLet\u2019s not forget what a raging masterpiece\u201d the opera is. PHOTOS: LA Opera through the years This is exactly what Kosky and his 1927 co-director, Suzanne Andrade, along with 1927 animator Paul Barritt, intend for us to forget in their fine entertainment. Kosky, in fact, is a slippery character. He says in the L.A. Opera program book that everyone knows \u201cThe Magic Flute\u201d and that an 8-year-old can enjoy it. He told The Times the opposite: that he hated Mozart\u2019s opera when he saw it as an 8-year-old and that his 1927 collaborators had never heard of it when he first approached them. Not every production of \u201cFlute,\u201d of course, needs to explore the social and spiritual intentions that Kosky\u2019s has little use for. Thus, the mysterious high priest Sarastro, in top hat, may be meant to merely represent Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s, the early French fantasist filmmaker whose 1902 \u201cA Trip to the Moon\u201d seems to have inspired some of Barritt\u2019s imagery. Sarastro\u2019s domain is full of fin-de-si\u00e8cle machinery. There are many visual surprises. I\u2019m not going to spoil them other than to say that the pink elephants are pure pleasure and that the butterflies are a little too cute in a Hallmark card sort of way. For all that is gained, some things are lost in this extravagant animated conceit. The music, although not secondary, can sometimes seem to take on an accompanimental role. The singers are so challenged with their exacting moves that they must often struggle to project the character of Mozart\u2019s score. The cast, probably necessarily, relies on emerging singers game for such a challenge. CRITICS\u2019 PICKS: What to watch, where to go, what to eat Janai Brugger, who has sung secondary roles with L.A. Opera, is a rapturous Pamina ready for prime time. Lawrence Brownlee presents a bright Tamino; Rodion Pogossov, a sweet slapstick Papageno; Amanda Woodbury, a sexy Papagena. Not everyone in \u201cFlute\u201d is meant to be endearing, especially Monostatos, but Rodell Rosel makes him the kind of vampire you\u2019d like to take home as a pet. Less effective are Evan Boyer, a small-voiced Sarastro, and Erika Mikl\u00f3sa, a still Queen of the Night. Both seem straitjacketed in solitary poses they can\u2019t quite seem to overcome. James Conlon has had experience conducting \u201cFlute\u201d on film. He was responsible for a more intense performance used in 2006 as the soundtrack for Kenneth Branagh\u2019s fine version of the opera. For Kosky, Conlon lights up and maintains a sprightly pace that feels natural despite the production\u2019s demanding cinematic needs. In the end, Kosky\u2019s \u201cFlute\u201d may be more remarkable as a hybrid of film and theater than of cartoon and opera. But it is fun, if, perhaps, an uncharacteristically tame debut for a provocateur. mark.swed@latimes.com  It's a date Get our L.A.
