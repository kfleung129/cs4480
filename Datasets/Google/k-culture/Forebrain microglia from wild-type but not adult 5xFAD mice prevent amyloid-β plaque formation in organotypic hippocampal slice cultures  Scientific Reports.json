In the present study, an organotypic hippocampal slice culture (OHSC) system with an in vivo-like microglial-neuronal environment was used to investigate the potential contribution of microglia to A\u03b2 plaque formation. We found that microglia ingested A\u03b2, thereby preventing plaque formation in OHSCs. Conversely, A\u03b2 deposits formed rapidly in microglia-free wild-type slices. The capacity to prevent A\u03b2 plaque formation was absent in forebrain microglia from young adult but not juvenile 5xFamilial Alzheimer\u2019s disease (FAD) mice. Since no loss of A\u03b2 clearance capacity was observed in both wild-type and cerebellar microglia from 5xFAD animals, the high A\u03b21\u221242 burden in the forebrain of 5xFAD animals likely underlies the exhaustion of microglial A\u03b2 clearance capacity. These data may therefore explain why A\u03b2 plaque formation has never been described in wild-type mice and point to a beneficial role of microglia in AD pathology. We also describe a new method to study A\u03b2 plaque formation in a cell culture setting. Extracellular deposition of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) in plaque form is one of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer\u00b4s disease (AD)1. The amyloid cascade hypothesis, which postulates that the deposition of the A\u03b2-peptide in the brain is a key event in AD pathology, has influenced AD research for several decades. However, a number of studies on therapeutics (i.e., anti-amyloid antibody treatment) intended to reduce A\u03b2 production or aggregation have failed at various stages of development2, possibly because the mechanisms of A\u03b2 plaque formation and maintenance remain poorly understood. Thus, a better understanding of this pathophysiological phenomenon may promote research into new treatment options for AD. Microglia are the resident brain phagocytes whose role in A\u03b2 plaque formation is debated3,4. On one hand, previous studies have shown that microglia are able to take up A\u03b2 in vitro5,6,7,8. On the other hand, microglial depletion in vivo does not affect A\u03b2 plaque load, as demonstrated in two AD mouse models in which the amyloid precursor protein (APP) was overexpressed9. Two aspects may explain the difference in microglia A\u03b2 uptake capacity in in vitro vs. in vivo conditions. Recent evidence has suggested that cultured microglia display mRNA expression profiles that more closely resemble those of peritoneal macrophages, making them poor models for in vivo microglia10,11,12,13,14. Furthermore, it was found that in vivo depletion of microglia is followed by rapid repopulation of microglia-like cells of unknown origin, making it difficult to establish permanent microglia-free conditions in vivo15,16. Thus, a comprehensive analysis of the role of microglia in A\u03b2 plaque development requires an experimental system that allows reliable microglia depletion in vivo. Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs) serve as a powerful in vitro tool for studying cellular functions, since they maintain many structural and functional properties of the hippocampus in vivo. For example, OHSCs keep their in vivo capacity for supporting different types of neurons and glia and also retain the complex three-dimensional (3D) organization of the hippocampus. Given that the hippocampus is a strategic region for memory encoding and exhibits early neurodegeneration in AD17,18, OHSCs have been used to study various aspects of AD pathology such as tangle formation, or neuronal loss as a marker of neurodegeneration19,20,21. Of note, A\u03b2 plaque formation has hitherto not been observed or induced in OHSCs of wild-type mice. Thus far, transgenic mouse models of AD have been required to study cerebral A\u03b2 plaque formation (for review see:22), as these do not form in wild-type mice and also cannot be induced23,24,25. However, the mechanistic basis for the lack of A\u03b2 plaque formation in wild-type brain tissue has remained obscure. Remarkably, it is possible to deplete and replenish microglia in OHSCs26,27. Importantly, we have shown that after replenishment, microglia rapidly acquire an in vivo-like distribution and the typical ramified morphology26. Moreover, microglia precursor cells differentiate into ramified microglia when applied to microglia-free OHSC28. Taken together, our previous findings indicate that OHSCs provide an appropriate cellular environment which allows the investigation of microglia in an in vivo-like setting, making them a suitable model to explore the role of microglia in A\u03b2 plaque formation. Against this background, the aims of the present study were two-fold: To investigate the effect of microglia on cerebral A\u03b2 plaque formation in OHSCs derived from wild-type mice. To evaluate potential differences in amyloid-clearance capacity between microglia from wild-type and 5xFamilial Alzheimer\u2019s disease (FAD) mice. To elucidate the potential influence of microglia on A\u03b2 plaque formation, synthetic 5-carboxyfluorescein (5-FAM)-labeled human A\u03b21\u221242 was first applied to OHSCs and slices were examined two weeks later. As expected, treatment of microglia-containing wild-type OHSCs with synthetic 5-FAM-labeled A\u03b21\u221242 (n\u2009=\u20094; each 2\u2009\u03bcl of 15\u2009\u03bcM A\u03b2) did not result in plaque formation (Fig. 1A). In contrast, in microglia-free slices numerous plaque-like structures (green fluorescence) appeared within 14 days (Fig. 1B). To verify the existence of plaque-like structures and rule out artifacts of 5-FAM labeling, unlabeled synthetic A\u03b21\u221242 was administered. As an indicator of A\u03b2 plaque formation either Thioflavin S staining (yellow fluorescence) (Fig. 1C) or A\u03b2 immunohistochemistry using 6E10 antibody (green fluorescence) (Fig. 1D) were used. Both staining procedures confirmed the occurrence of plaque-like structures only in the absence of microglia (Fig. 1C,D). Quantitative western blotting analyses revealed significantly higher levels of A\u03b2 protein in microglia-free slices (189.31\u2009\u00b1\u20097.39% vs. 100.00\u2009\u00b1\u200914.11%; n\u2009=\u20094 experiments; Student\u2019s t test; p\u2009=\u20090.001) (Fig. 1H). On a single cell level, confocal imaging and three-dimensional (3D) surface reconstruction of microglia showed intracellular A\u03b2 material (6E10 staining, green fluorescence and Iba1 staining, red fluorescence) (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, replenishment of microglia-free slices with cultured primary microglia significantly abolished A\u03b2 plaque formation (Fig. 1G,F). Taken together, our data indicate that A\u03b2 plaques do not form in OHSC, while microglia are present. Microglia incorporate synthetic amyloid-\u03b2 and prevent plaque formation. (A,B,D,E) Iba1/DAPI (red/blue) staining on wild-type OHSC (dg\u2009=\u2009dentate gyrus; ca1/ca3\u2009=\u2009cornu ammonis 1/3) following treatment with FAM-labeled A\u03b21\u221242 indicates a lack of plaque formation in microglia-containing slices (A). In contrast, microglia depletion resulted in an increase of A\u03b2 plaques (B). Higher magnification reveals plaque-like structures (insert in (B)). Thioflavin S staining (C) and A\u03b2 immunohistochemistry (D) confirmed the formation of A\u03b2 plaques. (E) Confocal analyses of OHSC demonstrate the microglial uptake of A\u03b2 (arrowhead). (F) Replenishment of microglia-depleted OHSC with primary forebrain microglia significantly reduces the A\u03b2 plaque-load. Similar results were obtained in at least 4 independent experiments (G) Quantification of A\u03b2 positive material using Image J revealed reduced A\u03b2-positive area fraction (0.903\u2009\u00b1\u20090.138%) in replenished slices compared to microglia-free slices (1.756\u2009\u00b1\u20090.318%) (Data are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM from n\u2009=\u20092 experiments with 11 slices/group; Mann-Whitney U; *p\u2009=\u20090.038). (H) Quantitative Western immunoblot analysis of A\u03b2 fragments using 6E10 antibody and densitometric analyses revealed significantly higher A\u03b2 levels in microglia-free slices (189.31\u2009\u00b1\u20097.39%) compared to microglia-containing tissue (100.00\u2009\u00b1\u200914.11%; Student\u2019s t test; p\u2009=\u20090.001). Scale bars: A, B, C, D, F: 100\u2009\u03bcm; E: 10\u2009\u03bcm. Next, an ultrastructural analysis with immuno-electron microscopy was performed to substantiate the confocal microscopy findings on A\u03b2 plaque formation in wild-type OHSCs. Furthermore, we aimed for a more detailed morphological characterization of A\u03b2 positive structures. 6E10-labeled A\u03b2 (silver-intensified immunogold labelling) was observed in the lysosomal compartment of Iba1-positive microglia (DAB staining) (Fig. 2A). These findings suggest that aside from incorporating amyloid, microglia diminish A\u03b2 load by digesting it. In OHSCs depleted from microglia, A\u03b2 was detected both extracellularly in plaques and intracellularly in neurons, with hallmark signs of degeneration such as nuclear fragmentation and loss of cellular membrane integrity (Fig. 2B). The latter two were never observed in microglia-containing slices. Our data are therefore in line with earlier findings indicating that intraneuronal A\u03b2 accumulation causes neurodegeneration29. Ultrastructural analyses reveals ingestion of amyloid-\u03b2 to the lysosomal compartment of microglia. (A,B) Immuno-electron microcroscopy using Iba1-DAB-staining as a microglial marker and immunogold-labeling for 6E10 in wild-type OHSC following treatment with synthetic amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2). (A) A high magnification electron micrograph revealed incorporation of A\u03b2 into the lysosomal compartment (ly) of microglia (mg; white line) (B). In the absence of microglia A\u03b2 is detected in pyramidal cells (pc, white line) showing signs of nuclear degeneration (n, nucleus) and in forms of extracellular plaques (asterisks). Scale bars: A: 2,500\u2009nm B: 500\u2009nm. Our data point towards a marked inhibitory influence of microglia on A\u03b2 plaque formation. Drawing on findings which suggested no impact of microglia on A\u03b2 plaque formation in transgenic mouse models of AD9, we next compared microglia from wild-type mice with those derived from 5xFAD animals. Microglia-depleted OHSCs were replenished with microglia from the forebrain (cortex and hippocampus) from either wild-type or 5xFAD mice. Furthermore, forebrain microglia from juvenile (5-week-old) and adult (6-month-old) mice were compared between genotypes. An initial in-depth morphological analysis by 3D single-cell reconstruction revealed that replenished microglia displayed no significant differences with respect to process length or the number of branch points (Suppl. Fig. 1A\u2013E) and were evenly distributed within slices (Fig. 3A\u2013D). Thus, irrespective of age or genotype, replenished microglia acquired an in vivo-like, ramifiedmorphology. Following replenishment with either 5-week-old (Fig. 3A) or 6-month-old wild-type microglia (Fig. 3B) and subsequent treatment with synthetic A\u03b21\u221242, no A\u03b2 plaque formation was detected in slices by Thioflavin-S staining. Similarly, slices replenished with microglia from 5-week-old 5xFAD animals displayed no plaque-like structures after Thioflavin-S staining (Fig. 3C). However, when slices were replenished with microglia isolated from 6-month-old 5xFAD mice, A\u03b2 plaque formation was observed (Fig. 3D). Quantification of Thioflavin-S staining showed that A\u03b2 plaque formation in slices replenished with microglia from 6-month-old 5xFAD mice occurred to a similar extent to that in microglia-free slices (Fig. 3I). All other microglia-containing slices did not display significant differences with respect to A\u03b2 plaque formation (Fig. 3I), indicating that microglia from 6-month-old 5xFAD mice lost their capacity to prevent plaque formation. Forebrain microglia from adult FAD mice do not prevent A\u03b2-plaque formation. Upper Panel Low magnification images of microglia-depleted wild-type OHSC following replenishment with either 5-weeks-old (A,C) or 6-months-old forebrain microglia (B,D) from wild-type (A,B) or 5xFAD mice (C,D). Replenished microglia (Iba1/red) were evenly distributed throughout the slice (neuronal staining by NeuN/blue). Thioflavin S staining (green) revealed plaque-like structures ((D) insert) only in OHSCs replenished with microglia from adult 5xFAD mice. Scale bar: 100\u2009\u03bcm Lower Panel High magnification images of replenished cerebellar microglia (Iba1/red) from either 5-weeks-old (E,G) or 6-months-old (F,H) wild-type (E,F) or 5xFAD mice (G,H). Replenished microglia (Iba1/red) were evenly distributed throughout the slice and acquired a ramified morphology (E\u2013H). Scale bar: 10\u2009\u03bcm. Densitometric analysis of ThioflavinS-positive material in OHSCs was performed by Image J. ANOVA followed by Scheff\u00e9 post-hoc test revealed that wild-type juvenile (0.331\u2009\u00b1\u20090.036%, n\u2009=\u200935, p\u2009<\u20090.001) or adult forebrain microglia (0.393\u2009\u00b1\u20090.043%, n\u2009=\u200933, p\u2009<\u20090.001) impeded plaque formation compared to endogenous wild-type microglia (0.178\u2009\u00b1\u20090.017%, n\u2009=\u200933, p\u2009<\u20090.001). No significant difference was found between microglia-free OHSCs (0.892\u2009\u00b1\u20090.106%, n\u2009=\u200930) and slices replenished with forebrain microglia from adult 5xFAD mice (0.750\u2009\u00b1\u20090.089%, n\u2009=\u200920), while forebrain microglia from juvenile 5xFAD mice prevented plaque formation (0.318\u2009\u00b1\u20090.033%, n\u2009=\u200931, p\u2009<\u20090.001) compared to endogenous wild-type microglia. Data are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM from three independent experiments (I). In contrast one way ANOVA revealed no differences in densitometric analysis of ThioflavinS-positive material between microglia cells isolated from the cerebellum of juvenile or young adult wild type or 5xFAD mice. Number of OHSC analysed: juv.wt n\u2009=\u200918, ad.wt n\u2009=\u200911, juv.FAD n\u2009=\u200914, ad.FAD n\u2009=\u200916, data are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM from two independent experiments (J). To address whether this loss of function was due to the (i) age or genetic background of 5xFAD mice or (ii) to the presence of high A\u03b2 levels or plaque load in the forebrain a similar experiment was performed using microglia from the cerebellum. The cerebellum in APP transgenic mice stays free of A\u03b2 plaques due to low expression of the transgenes in that area30,31,32, thus microglia in the cerebellum reside in an A\u03b2-free brain area. When transferred into OHSCs also cerebellar microglia invaded the slices and acquired a ramified morphology comparable to their counterparts from the forebrain (Fig. 3E\u2013H). After treatment with synthetic A\u03b21\u221242 and quantification of Thioflavin S staining it was found that cerebellar microglia prevented plaque formation irrespective of the genetic background or the age of the animals (Fig. 3J). We provide first evidence for A\u03b2 plaque formation in OHSC derived from wild-type mice. Previous attempts using intracranial injections of distinct A\u03b2 species resulted in A\u03b2 plaque formation in transgenic mouse models of AD, but not in wild-type animals23,24,25. Likewise, in OHSC of wild-type mice A\u03b2 deposits have never been described, though a successful modeling of tau-pathology and associated neurodegeneration was accomplished in this culture system19,20,21. Induction of plaque formation in wild-type animals in general failed for as yet unknown reasons. Numerous studies have investigated the role of microglia in the pathogenesis of AD; however, this remains a contentious issue. Our data suggest that the previously observed lack of A\u03b2 plaque formation in wild-type mice relates to the A\u03b2 clearance capacity of microglia19,20,21, since A\u03b2 deposits exclusively formed in wild-type tissue when microglia had been depleted. This finding is corroborated by the observation that microglia take up and possibly digest A\u03b2 in the lysosomal compartment thereby preventing plaque formation in OHSC. This is in line with earlier studies linking dysfunctional intracellular degradation mechanisms in the autophagy-lysosomal system with AD pathogenesis33,34. Pickford et al. showed that levels of beclin 1, which modulates APP metabolism and promotes neurodegeneration, were diminished in affected brain regions of patients with early AD. Microglial beclin 1 has been reported to regulate phagocytosis and is impaired in AD35. Moreover, we found that only in the absence of microglia intraneuronal A\u03b2 deposits occur, which was associated with neuronal degeneration. Taken together, our data underline the proposed beneficial role of microglia by promoting phagocytosis, degrading and ultimately clearing A\u03b2, one of the pathogenic proteins deposited in AD36. While microglia derived from 5-week-old 5xFAD mice were able to impede A\u03b2 plaque formation in vitro, its counterparts isolated from A\u03b2 depositing 6-month-old 5xFAD mice sustain a significant loss of this function. This is in good agreement with in vivo observations in this particular mouse model. These transgenic mice express the mutated human amyloid precursor protein as well as the mutated human PSEN-1 gene, which leads to a tremendous A\u03b21\u221242 burden. Accordingly, the first signs of plaque formation are already detectable at 2 months of age32. In this light, our data may indicate that microglia from young mice in general are initially capable of preventing plaque formation, whereby a loss of this particular function is critical to A\u03b2 plaque formation in 5xFAD mice. It could therefore be hypothesized that chronic exposure to high A\u03b21\u221242 burden plays a causative role in the early exhaustion of microglial A\u03b2 clearance capacity, which, in turn, potentially leads to premature senescence of the brain\u2019s protective system11,13. In order to test this hypothesis we have replenished microglia-depleted OHSCs with microglia from the cerebellum, an A\u03b2 free brain area. Thus, microglia in the cerebellum are not exposed to high A\u03b21\u221242 burden. Different from the effects seen with forebrain microglia, no differences in A\u03b2 plaque formation were observed when cerebellar microglia were present in the slices, i.e., A\u03b2 plaques generally did not form. These data strongly support the notion that it is indeed both the chronic exposure to high A\u03b21\u221242 levels and plaque burden in the forebrain that are causing an exhaustion of microglial A\u03b2 clearance capacity. In contrast, these findings do not suggest that a general effect of aging or the genetic background of 5xFAD animals underlie the impairment of this particular microglia function. Our data are in good agreement with recent findings, as it was described that microglia isolated from two different AD mouse models (APPPS1 and APP23) showed impaired phagocytic capacity and A\u03b2 uptake which correlated to the A\u03b2 plaque burden of the tissue from which the microglia were isolated37,38. It has furthermore been described that microglia of AD brains resemble aged microglia and show age-associated microglial dysfunction of phagocytosis, motility and morphology (reviewed in39). This loss of microglia function could explain why the deletion of microglia in adult AD mouse models did not affect A\u03b2 plaque load9. The mechanisms by which elevated A\u03b21\u221242 levels and plaque burden lead to the observed loss in microglia function remain to be established. Of particular relevance to our present findings on forebrain microglial function is the question of whether changes in CD33 expression, an immunoglobulin-like lectin and risk gene for AD, inhibit the clearance of A\u03b2 in microglial cell cultures7. It has moreover become increasingly clear that neurotransmitters may also modulate microglia A\u03b2 uptake40. Since OHSCs lack the input from other brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex or brain stem nuclei, the lack of this input may also affect the development of A\u03b2 plaques in OHSCs. Forthcoming studies should therefore also address the potential influence of aminergic or glutamatergic neurotransmitters on A\u03b2 plaque formation in OHSCs. In summary, this study reinforces the notion that the innate immune cells of the brain serve as key players in AD pathology. By taking advantage of the fact that the depletion and replenishment of microglia allows for the rapid assembly of chimeric OHSCs, we now describe a powerful experimental model to in which to study the role of microglia in A\u03b2 plaque formation and maintenance. 5xFamilial Alzheimer\u2019s disease (5xFAD) mice strain Tg679932 were a kind gift from Marco Prinz, University Medical Center Freiburg. The 5xFAD transgenic mice have the following five mutations: Swedish (K670N and M671L), Florida (I716V) and London (V717I) in human APP695 and human PS1 cDNA (M146L and L286V) under the transcriptional control of the neuron-specific Thy-1 promoter. Animals were bred for heterozygosity. As wild type controls FAD-negative littermates were used. Both male and female have been used in this study. Mice were bred under pathogen-free conditions in a temperature and humidity controlled vivarium with a 12\u2009h light-dark cycle, food and water were available ad libitum. All animal experiments have been approved by and were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Regierungspr\u00e4sidium Freiburg legislation for animal experiments. Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSC) have been prepared from newborn (P0-P3) C57BL/6N mice and were cultured according to the interface method26. OHSC were kept for 7 days in vitro (div) at 35\u2009\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2) before treatment. Medium was changed every other day. Microglia were depleted specifically from freshly prepared slice cultures using the macrophage toxin clodronate (Merck-Millipore, cat. no. 233183). Clodronate disodium-salt was solved in ultra-pure H2O (Biochrom) with a concentration of 1\u2009mg/mL. Freshly prepared OHSC were incubated with 100\u2009\u03bcg clodronate per mL standard culture medium for 24\u2009hours at 35\u2009\u00b0C. Subsequently, OHSC were rinsed with warm phosphate buffered saline (PBS) carefully and placed on fresh culture medium. Microglia-depleted OHSC were kept at least for 7\u2009div before experiment. Medium was changed every other day. Primary mixed glia cultures were prepared from newborn C57BL/6 mice as previously described in detail41. After two weeks in culture microglia were harvested by shake-off and used immediately to replenish microglia-free OHSC as described below. Juvenile or adult microglia were acutely isolated from forebrain (cortex/hippocampus) or cerebellum of 5-weeks- and 25-weeks-old 5xFAD mice or wild type control-littermates as previously described42. In brief, the tissue was dissociated mechanically to a single cell suspension and the microglia cells were separated by density gradient centrifugation43. All steps were carried out on 4\u2009\u00b0C to inhibit a change in microglia activity status. After isolation adult microglia were used immediately to replenish OHSC. To do so, the cell number of isolated microglia was determined, cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 200\u2009g for 10\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C and carefully re-suspended in culture medium to a final density of 1000 cells per \u03bcL. 2000\u2009cells in 2\u2009\u03bcL medium were added an each microglia-free OHSC. Cells were allowed to distribute and ramify for 12 to 14 days before further treatment. Synthetic human amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide comprising amino acids 1\u221242 either unlabeled or labeled with 5-carboxyfluorescein (5-FAM) was purchased from AnaSpec (cat. no. 24224 or 23525-05, respectively). The peptide was reconstituted in Dulbecco\u2019s Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) to a 15\u2009\u03bcM solution. The solution was stored for 7 days at 37\u2009\u00b0C and was mixed every day for 5\u2009minutes by vortex. Aliquots were stored at \u221220\u2009\u00b0C. Before usage on OHSCs, A\u03b2 was sonicated for 10\u2009min in an ultrasound water bath followed by 2\u2009min vortex to break down potential aggregates. 2\u2009\u03bcL of A\u03b2 were dropped on top of each OHSC 4\u2009hours after medium change. Treatment was repeated 4 times every other day, thus each slice was in total treated with 8\u2009\u03bcL of a 15\u2009\u03bcM A\u03b2 solution. To analyze the A\u03b2 solution dot blot assay was performed: 2\u2009\u03bcl the labeled or unlabeled solution was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (0.1\u2009\u03bcm pore size; Whatman). Membranes were allowed to air dry and consequently immunoblotted using primary antibodies 6E10 (1:1000, Covance, cat. no. SIG-39320), A11 (1:1000, Millipore, cat. no. AB9234), OC (1:1000, Millipore, cat. no. AB2286) and corresponding HRP conjugated secondary antibodies. Antibody reactivity was visualized using the ECL reagent. Bioluminescence was assessed in a Chemidoc MP imaging system (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany). Analysis of the A\u03b2 solution by dot blot revealed A11 immunoreactivity only in the brain homogenate of a plaque-containing 5XFAD mouse and no A11 immunoreactivity in the unlabelledor labeled synthetic A\u03b2 preparation. Conversely, OC immunoreactivity was seen only in synthetic A\u03b2 samples, indicating the presence of fibrillary material in the used A\u03b2 solutions (Supplement Fig. 2). For analysis OHSC were fixed in 4%-paraformaldehyde in PBS followed by immunofluorescent staining as described elsewhere in detail26,44. Antibodies were NeuN (1:1000, Millipore, cat. no. MAB377) to stain neuronal nuclei, Iba1 (1:1000, WAKO chemicals, cat. no. 019-19741) to stain microglia, 4\u20326-Diamidine-2-phenylindol (DAPI, 1:1000, 1\u2009mg/mL solution, ThermoScientific, cat. no. 62248) to stain nuclei. To stain amyloid beta fragments OHSCs were treated for 30\u2009min with 70% formic acid prior to the usual staining protocol, the antibody used was beta amyloid 1\u221216 (6E10, 1:500, Covance, cat. no. SIG-39320). Secondary antibodies were labeled fluorescently: donkey anti-mouse-IgG Alexa488 (1:1000, Invitrogen, cat. no. A-21202), donkey anti-rabbit-IgG Alexa647 (1:1000, Invitrogen, cat. no. A-31573). Thioflavin S staining of beta-sheet rich structures was performed according to the modified Thioflavin S staining introduced by Sun and colleagues45, but omitting incubation in potassium permanganate since this might interfere with co-immunolabeling. Thioflavin S was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (cat. no. T-1892), solved in sterile PBS to a stock solution of 0.1% (w/V) and filtered before further dilution. Briefly, OHSCs were incubated for 8\u2009min with 0.002% Thioflavin S in PBS, washed twice for 1\u2009min in 50% ethanol and 5\u2009min in PBS. Afterwards OHSCs were processed for immunofluorescent staining. Immunofluorescently stained OHSC were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy using the ZEISS LSM 510 META. Overview images of whole OHSC were done with a C-Apochromat 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009/0.45\u2009W objective, high magnification or z-stack images were obtained using a LD LCI Plan-Apochromat 25\u2009\u00d7\u2009/0.8\u2009Imm. Korr. DIC objective. Thioflavin S staining was quantified in 2D images using the software Image J 1.47v (National Institute of Health) by thresholding the Thioflavin S staining and determining percentage of area covered. 3D single cell and surface reconstruction was performed on z-stacks (0.8\u2009\u03bcm image interval) using the software IMARIS 7.6.5 (Bitplane). IMARIS surface creation was done by automatic detection. To view inside the cell, the surface was cut using the clipping plane. The IMARIS plugin filament tracer allows the reconstructions and tracing of microglia filaments. The automatic detection mode was applied for filament creation in a defined region of interest as described before26. 10\u2009cells per group were analyzed morphometrically. Tissue pellets (\u221280\u2009\u00b0C) of hippocampal slice cultures were lyzed in ice-cold lysis buffer (pH 6.8, 42\u2009mM Tris-HCl, 1.3% SDS, 6.5% glycerol, 100\u2009\u03bcM sodium orthovanadate in double-destilled water) for 10\u2009minutes, triturated with a pipette and centrifuged (13,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g, 15\u2009min, 4\u2009\u00b0C). Next total protein content was measured using a bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Samples (20\u2009\u03bcg total protein per lane) were analyzed using Novex\u00ae 10\u201320%-Tricine Protein Gels (Thermo Scientific) and SDS-Page according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. After antigen retrieval nitrocellulose membranes were blocked for 1\u2009h in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 5% nonfat dried milk. Then, the membranes were incubated with mouse anti beta amyloid 1\u221216 (6E10, 1:500, Covance) in blocking solution overnight, at 4\u2009\u00b0C. After washing with TBS-T, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:25,000 in TBS-T containing 1% BSA, GE Healthcare) for 1\u2009hr at room temperature. The immunoreactive bands were visualized using an ECL western blot detection system (GE Healthcare) and analyzed using Fusion-SL image acquisition system (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany). To confirm equal protein loading, membranes were probed with antibody recognizing actin (1:5,000, Sigma). For semiquantitative analysis four western blots per condition were analyzed for each antibody. Films were digitally scanned and densitometry conducted using Image J 1.40 analysis software. To control for inconsistencies in loading protein bands of interest were normalized to actin loading controls. OHSC (at least n\u2009=\u20096 for each condition) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffer (PB) for 60\u2009minutes at 4\u2009\u00b0C. For immuno-electron microscopy OHSCs were washed in 50\u2009mM TBS and blocked in 20% normal goat serum (NGS) in TBS for 1\u2009h. Subsequently, the cultures were incubated with primary antibodies rabbit anti-Iba1 (1:200) and mouse anti-6E10 (1:100) diluted in TBS containing 2% NGS overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. After 1\u2009h of washing in TBS, the OHSCs were incubated with a biotinylated anti-rabbit (for Iba1, 1:100) and a 1.4\u2009nm gold-coupled anti-mouse secondary antibody (for 6E10; 1:100) in TBS containing 2% NGS overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. OHSCs were rinsed in TBS and then fixed for 10\u2009minutes in a 1% GA solution. Tissue-bound gold particles were enlarged using a silver intensification kit (HQ-Silver, Nanoprobes, USA). Next, sections were washed in double-destilled water for 10\u2009min and 50\u2009mM TB for 1\u2009hr. Visualization of antibody binding by diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining was performed using the ABC Standard Kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, USA) with DAB and H2O2 as substrates in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s suggestions. The sections then underwent osmification for 40\u2009min in a solution of 0.5% OsO4 and 6.86% sucrose. Following osmification, OHSCs were washed in PB followed by 50% and 60% ethanol (EtOH) for 10\u2009minutes each. The tissue was then incubated in 1% uranyl acetate in 70% EtOH for 35\u2009minutes, followed by 10\u2009min dehydration steps in increasing grades of EtOH. After washing in propylene oxide, the tissue was embedded in Durcopan (Fluka). Ultrathin sections (60\u2009nm) of selected hippocampal areas were cut (Leica EM UC6) and mounted on Formvar-coated nickel grids. Sections were viewed and examined in an electron microscope (LEO 906\u2009E, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and digital images were captured using ISP Software (Tr\u00f6ndle, Germany). For further characterization of synthetic A\u03b2 samples were loaded on a 300\u2009mesh formvar/carbon coated copper grid (Plano). The samples were fixed for 5\u2009minutes in 1% glutaraldehyde. After washing with double-destilled water the samples were negatively stained for 1\u2009minute with 1% uranyl acetate. As shown in supplementary Fig. 2 fibrils were observed in the used A\u03b2 solutions. Morphometric and densitometric data were statistically analysed using the SPSS (IBM) software. Data were tested for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. If data were normally distributed, 2-sided unpaired Student\u2019s t-test was applied. If the data did not meet the criteria of normal distribution the Mann-Whitney U test was applied. For multiple comparisons data were analysed using One-way ANOVA followed by Scheff\u00e9 post-hoc test. Differences were accounted as significant at p\u2009<\u20090.05.
