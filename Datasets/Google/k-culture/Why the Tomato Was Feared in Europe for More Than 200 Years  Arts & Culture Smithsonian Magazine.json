Photo Credit: *Kicki* via Compfight cc In the late 1700s, a large percentage of Europeans feared the tomato. A nickname for the fruit was the \u201cpoison apple\u201d because it was thought that aristocrats got sick and died after eating them, but the truth of the matter was that wealthy Europeans used pewter plates, which were high in lead content. Because tomatoes are so high in acidity, when placed on this particular tableware, the fruit would leach lead from the plate, resulting in many deaths from lead poisoning. No one made this connection between plate and poison at the time; the tomato was picked as the culprit. Around 1880, with the invention of the pizza in Naples, the tomato grew widespread in popularity in Europe. But there\u2019s a little more to the story behind the misunderstood fruit\u2019s stint of unpopularity in England and America, as Andrew F. Smith details in his\u00a0The Tomato in America: Early History, Culture, and Cookery. The tomato didn\u2019t get blamed just for what was really lead poisoning. Before the fruit made its way to the table in North America, it was classified as a\u00a0deadly nightshade, a poisonous family of Solanaceae\u00a0plants that contain toxins called\u00a0tropane alkaloids. One of the earliest-known European references to the food was made by the Italian herbalist,\u00a0Pietro Andrae Matthioli, who first classified the \u201cgolden apple\u201d as a nightshade and a mandrake\u2014a category of food known as an aphrodisiac. The mandrake has a history that dates back to the Old Testament; it is referenced twice as the Hebrew word\u00a0dudaim,\u00a0which roughly translates to \u201clove apple.\u201d (In Genesis, the mandrake is used as a love potion). Matthioli\u2019s classification of the tomato as a mandrake had later ramifications. Like similar fruits and vegetables in the\u00a0solanaceae\u00a0family\u2014the eggplant for example, the tomato garnered a shady reputation for being both poisonous and a source of temptation. (Editor\u2019s note: This sentence has been edited to clarify that it was the mandrake, not the tomato, that is believed to have been referenced in the Old Testament) But what really did the tomato in, according to Smith\u2019s research, was John\u00a0Gerard\u2019s publication of\u00a0Herball in 1597 which drew heavily from the agricultural works of\u00a0Dodoens and l\u2019Ecluse\u00a0(1553). According to Smith, most of the information (which was inaccurate to begin with) was\u00a0plagiarized\u00a0by Gerard, a barber-surgeon who misspelled words like\u00a0Lycoperticum\u00a0in the collection\u2019s rushed final product. Smith quotes Gerard: Gerard considered \u2018the whole plant\u2019 to be \u2018of ranke and stinking savour.\u2019\u2026\u00a0The fruit was corrupt which he left to every man\u2019s censure. While the leaves and stalk of the tomato plant are toxic, the fruit is not. Gerard\u2019s opinion of the tomato, though based on a fallacy,\u00a0prevailed in Britain and in the British North American colonies for over 200 years. Around this time it was also believed that tomatoes were best eaten in hotter countries, like the fruit\u2019s place of origin in Mesoamerica. The tomato was eaten by\u00a0the Aztecs as early as 700 AD and called the \u201ctomatl,\u201d (its name in Nahuatl), and\u00a0wasn\u2019t grown in Britain until the 1590s. In the early 16th century, Spanish conquistadors returning from expeditions in Mexico and other parts of Mesoamerica were thought to have first introduced the seeds to southern Europe. Some researchers credit Cortez with bringing the seeds to Europe in 1519 for ornamental purposes. Up until the late 1800s in\u00a0cooler climates, tomatoes were solely grown for ornamental purposes in gardens rather than for eating. Smith continues: John Parkinson the apothecary to King James I and botanist for King Charles I, procalimed that while love apples were eaten by the people in the hot countries to \u2018coole and quench the heate and thirst of the hot stomaches,\u201d British gardeners grew them only for curiousity and fo the beauty of the fruit. The first known reference to tomato in the British North American Colonies was published in herbalist William Salmon\u2019s\u00a0Botanologia\u00a0printed in 1710 which places the tomato in the Carolinas. The tomato became an acceptable edible fruit in many regions, but the United States of America weren\u2019t as united in the 18th and early 19th century. Word of the tomato spread slowly along with plenty of myths and questions from farmers. Many knew how to grow them, but not how to cook the food. By 1822, hundreds of tomato recipes appeared in local periodicals and newspapers, but fears and rumors of the plant\u2019s potential poison lingered. By the 1830s when the love apple was cultivated in New York, a new concern emerged. The Green Tomato Worm, measuring three to four inches in length with a horn sticking out of its back,\u00a0began taking over tomato patches across the state. \u00a0According to\u00a0The Illustrated Annual Register of Rural Affairs and Cultivator Almanac\u00a0(1867) edited by J.J. Thomas, it was believed that a mere brush with such a worm could result in death. \u00a0The description is chilling: The tomato in all of our gardens is infested with a very large thick-bodied green worm, with oblique white sterols along its sides, and a curved thorn-like horn at the end of its back. According to Smith\u2019s research, even Ralph Waldo Emerson feared the presence of the tomato-loving worms: They were\u00a0\u201can object of much terror, it being currently regarded as poisonous and imparting a poisonous quality to the fruit if it should chance to crawl upon it.\u201d Around the same time period, a man by the name of Dr. Fuller in New York was quoted in The Syracuse Standard,\u00a0saying he had found a five-inch tomato worm in\u00a0his garden.\u00a0He captured the worm in a bottle and said it was\u00a0\u201cpoisonous as a rattlesnake\u201d when it would throw spittle at its prey. According to Fuller\u2019s account, once the skin came into contact with the spittle, it swelled immediately. A few hours later, the victim would seize up and die. It was a \u201cnew enemy\u00a0to human existence,\u201d he said. Luckily, an\u00a0entomologist\u00a0by the name of Benjamin Walsh argued that the dreaded tomato worm wouldn\u2019t hurt a flea. Thomas continues: Now that we have become familiarized with it these fears have all vanished, and we have become quite indifferent towards this creature, knowing it to be merely an ugly-looking worm which eats some of the leaves of the tomato\u2026 The fear, it seems, had subsided. With the rise of agricultural societies, farmers began investigating the tomato\u2019s use and experimented with different varieties. According to Smith, back in the 1850s the name tomato was so highly regarded that it was used to sell other plants at market. By 1897, innovator Joseph Campbell figured out that tomatoes keep well when canned and popularized condensed tomato soup. Today, tomatoes\u00a0are consumed around the world in\u00a0countless varieties: heirlooms, romas, cherry tomatoes\u2014to name a few. More than one and a half billion tons of tomatoes are produced commercially every year. In 2009, the United States alone produced\u00a03.32 billion pounds of fresh-market tomatoes. But some of the plant\u2019s night-shady past seems to have followed the tomato in pop culture. In the 1978 musical drama/ comedy \u201cAttack of the Killer Tomatoes,\u201d giant red blobs of the fruit terrorize the country. \u201cThe nation is in chaos. Can nothing stop this tomato onslaught?\u201d Get the latest Travel & Culture stories in your inbox. K. Annabelle Smith\n|\n\n| READ MORE K.
