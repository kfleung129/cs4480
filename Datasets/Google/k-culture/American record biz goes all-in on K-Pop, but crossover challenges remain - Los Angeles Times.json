    "text": "In July 2017, the K-pop group Monsta X played its first shows the U.S.: two nights at the 2,400-capacity Novo in downtown L.A. The sets were hotly-tipped among the genre\u2019s superfans, who loved the brash aesthetic of singles like \u201cRush.\u201d But they were only just beginning to break through to U.S. audiences. What a difference two years makes. In August, the group will return to L.A. to headline Staples Center, a capstone of its ascent into K-pop\u2019s A-list. And this time around, they have a U.S. major record label and the most powerful music management consortium in the country behind them. In May, the seven-member group \u2014 which performs in Korean, Japanese and English \u2014 announced they\u2019d signed with Sony Music subsidiary Epic Records, putting them alongside U.S. rap and pop stars like DJ Khaled, Camila Cabello and Travis Scott. \u201cWe have always agreed on a vision for Monsta X that certainly includes, but extends beyond their core K-pop Audience,\u201d said Ezekiel Lewis, executive vice president of A&R at Epic Records. \u201cWe see them as a potentially enormous boy band that happens to be from Korea as opposed to viewing through the more narrow lens of K-pop. The deal was brokered by Eshy Gazit, former manager for K-Pop titans BTS. Gazit brought Monsta X with him to Maverick, the management firm owned by Live Nation, the largest concert promoter in the U.S. \u201cIt\u2019s great that K-pop is getting more of a spotlight,\u201d the band said, in a group-answered e-mail interview. These new deal mean they want to \u201cgo beyond K-Pop and challenge ourselves and what\u2019s possible.\u201d Monsta X isn\u2019t alone in that regard. Several of K-pop\u2019s top acts have recently inked high-profile deals with U.S. major labels, including Interscope\u2019s Blackpink, Capitol\u2019s NCT127 and Republic\u2019s Tomorrow X Together. RCA has signed Ateez. Columbia has a deal with BTS, the group that took K-pop into the stratosphere in America. In the U.S., K-pop has grown from an underground digital fandom to \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and the Grammys. Festivals like KCON attract hundreds of thousands of fans. After BTS\u2019 three Billboard 200-topping albums and sold-out Rose Bowl dates, K-pop now compares with Beyonc\u00e8 and Taylor Swift as a live draw. As was the case with disco, teen-pop and EDM, the major U.S. record companies are now scrambling to invest in K-Pop, another fast-paced, diverse and youth-skewing genre that\u2019s taken off globally. There are risks, though. K-pop is still primarily sung in Korean. There\u2019s already a distinct, hierarchic label system and fan-driven culture that created these groups. The hot acts change quickly and the fanbase is young and fickle. If K-pop\u2019s trends shift, or the genre falls from favor, labels heavily invested in stalled-out acts could be left holding the bag. Despite its massive appeal online and in arenas, there are substantial challenges in taking K-pop up the U.S. charts. But the lure of sold-out stadiums is finally too much for major labels to ignore. \u201cThe world has turned global. Music is growing into that newfound global space, and [South] Korea is leading in the new era,\u201d Gazit said. \u201cThat is the next step in the journey of K-pop, to fully emerge in the U.S. market.\u201d Nearly a decade ago, K-pop act Girls Generation signed to Interscope and 2NE1 released music with Capitol. They laid the groundwork for the genre\u2019s latest wave, but perhaps peaked early. After BTS, however, the scope of what was possible for K-pop in America changed. Popular groups like \u201cTwice, Blackpink \u2014 they all reached the U.S. top songs chart. There\u2019s massive crossover potential, and it\u2019s all over the country, every single city and state,\u201d said Kathy Baker, the U.S. head of label relations for YouTube Music, where BTS beat Blackpink to set a record for the most-viewed clip over 24 hours with their video (with Halsey) for \u201cBoy With Luv.\u201d Monsta X is one of the top groups hoping to match that success. The band \u2014 Wonho, I.M, Kihyun, Minhyuk, Jooheon, Shownu and Hyungwon \u2014 formed in 2015 through a South Korean reality show. They stood out for a more aggressive style that mixed modern trap, R&B and dance music with dark electronic tinges. Singles like \u201cHero\u201d became genre staples. They branched out to collaborate with EDM superstar Steve Aoki on \u201cPlay It Cool.\u201d Their first single for Epic, \u201cWho Do U Love,\u201d is a moody collaboration with rapper and label-mate French Montana. The song aims straight at Top 40 radio, with crossover appeal to hip-hop and R&B fans: key demographics for a label growing K-pop beyond the already-devoted. \u201cWe love to push boundaries,\u201d Monsta X said. \u201cThat\u2019s how we are building our sound and keep changing over the years. \u201cWe see the fact that we are recording them in English as an advantage,\u201d Lewis added. \u201cThat will help enable us to market them to a much wider audience and give us a real shot at being successful at U.S. and European radio.\u201d The band\u2019s manager Gazit was one of the architects of BTS\u2019 U.S. success, which changed the whole scope of K-Pop in the U.S. (He\u2019d previously worked as an engineer and producer, and as CEO of the music marketing firm Gramophone Media). \u201cShifting the conversation about K-pop was a very challenging task,\u201d Gazit said. \u201cWhen I started to work with BTS in 2016, people in the industry and media were very hesitant to do anything with the band and most often ignored my emails and calls. Many people in the US viewed K-pop at the time as an artificial product and looked down on it. [But] I saw the huge potential in the amazing fanbase.\u201d Maverick, founded by Madonna manager Guy Oseary and one of the largest and most powerful music-management firms, hired Gazit and brought on Monsta X largely due to his experience in breaking K-pop to wider crowds. \u201cIt was an area we should be in. [Gazit] had the skill set and a band with the potential to be much bigger,\u201d said Greg Thompson, president of Maverick Music (and a former Capitol executive). They\u2019re one of several K-pop acts that could indeed get much more popular here. Blackpink\u2019s set at this year\u2019s Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival was one of the most anticipated (and talked-about) sets of the weekend. YouTube Music live-streamed their set on the side of a tower in Times Square. Some arena-size K-pop acts like Twice (headlining the Forum on July 17) are still unsigned by U.S. labels, and emerging acts like TXT (labelmates of BTS at Big Hit Entertainment in Seoul) could be up next. But it\u2019s not a matter of simply jumping on the K-pop bandwagon. The South Korean music industry that built K-pop is an established, distinct system with different structures and expectations. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like \u2018Who is the next one?\u2019 In any partnership there\u2019s got to be trust and that\u2019s not a fast process,\u201d said Jacqueline Saturn, the president of Capitol\u2019s Caroline/Harvest Records, who signed NCT127 to a deal in partnership with Seoul\u2019s SM Entertainment. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to spend time to understand the organization and know that they do know best. It\u2019s not \u2018Let us tell you what to do,\u2019 it\u2019s \u2018How do we partner to do something game-changing that will last a long time.\u2019\u201d Label executives and managers interviewed for this story declined to provide financial figures on these deals, which encompass varying levels of distribution, A&R, marketing and other label services. Most deals are partnerships with the groups\u2019 South Korean labels, which developed these acts for years. U.S. labels license the group\u2019s albums for North America, and mainly provide distribution and radio promotion, the latter of which is still considered key to a stateside breakthrough, and thus far elusive for K-pop. (Despite their success, even BTS has failed to crack the top 20 on Billboard\u2019s Pop Songs chart, which measures Top 40 radio airplay.) The U.S. labels are typically not part of the lucrative branding or merchandising deals that the South Korean labels have procured for their acts. And streams for K-pop acts still lag behind those of comparably popular hip-hop acts on subscription platforms like Spotify and Apple, from which U.S. labels draw the vast majority of their revenue. \u201cK-pop is unique because much of the development has already been done by K-pop companies,\u201d Thompson said. But it\u2019s complicated to balance that label and fan culture with the demands and limits of the U.S. record industry. \u201cIt\u2019s not so simple working with different cultures and companies. It\u2019s not \u2018Just do this, it\u2019s easy\u2019,\u201d Saturn said, describing the groundwork already done by South Korean labels. It\u2019s not so simple working with different cultures and companies. It\u2019s not \u2018Just do this, it\u2019s easy\u2019 \u2014 Jacqueline Saturn, president of Capitol\u2019s Caroline/Harvest Records And yet, the cache of K-pop could be worth it, said Jung-Bong Choi, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University who studies the globalization of South Korean pop culture. K-pop is uniquely suited to today\u2019s social media culture, where fan enthusiasm creates a community identity that goes far beyond music. \u201cK-pop subverts the top-down celebrity model of the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cThe artists treat you like some broad-based family: fan club parties, dance contests, meeting with the idols, etc.\u201d Like the sweep of Latin urban music across the pop charts, this is a pivot for how record labels see the genre\u2019s future. \u201cThe world\u2019s gotten smaller and streaming has taken down the barriers to entry. Social media opened doors and labels are thinking globally now,\u201d Thompson said. K-pop\u2019s malleability can appeal to many different cultures at once. \u201cLots of ethnic minorities who feel alienated from the European mainstream cultures tend to gravitate toward K-pop,\u201d Choi said. Label executives see it similarly. The future is in breaking singles that can speak to broad swaths of the U.S. (and the globe). \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t do this if there was only one road,\u201d Saturn said. K-pop can team up with \u201cLatin, hip-hop, pop, it\u2019s all happening. There\u2019s no limit to the amount of people you can reach.\u201d Labels are counting on K-pop acts scoring more Billboard Hot 100 hits. More collaborations like BTS\u2019 \u201cBoy With Luv\u201d featuring Halsey (which hit No. 8 on the Hot 100, a chart that measures streams, video consumption and radio airplay) are likely en route. \u201cA Billboard No. 1 recognizable from Peoria to Pittsburgh would be huge,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIf the music is great, it could become a big piece of Top 40. If the songs aren\u2019t great, it\u2019ll plateau.\u201d \u201cMy vision for Monsta X is fully integrated Pop, not just a K-pop band,\u201d Gazit said. \u201cTo create a household name where the music is more relevant to the pop world, and still keep the roots and expression of the band.\u201d Even if labels are finally jumping onboard, how do you translate that fan enthusiasm into a global phenomenon like \u201cDespacito?\u201d Language barriers never stopped U.S. fans discovering K-pop online, but pop radio is more conservative (Monsta X\u2019s \u201cWho Do U Love\u201d is sung entirely in English). Given that K-pop has reached ubiquity in South Korea, artists may also be looking elsewhere for growth. (It\u2019s also been a tumultuous year in Seoul, between the wide-reaching Burning Sun scandal and the recent resignation of YG founder Yang Hyun-suk.) \u201cK-pop at some point ceased to be a \u2018national brand\u2019,\u201d Choi said. \u201cRecent signing[s] with U.S. labels can be seen in continuity\u2026[with the] domestic K-pop industry reaching a saturation point.\u201d For artists, new commercial prospects in the U.S. also mean relentless schedules and career anxieties too. \u201cIt is kind of inevitable to face the challenge of growing pressure,\u201d Monsta X said, about leading the genre\u2019s next wave in the U.S. The \u201cintensive cycle of work is something to be accepted as a K-pop band.\u201d In the meantime, as Monsta X gears up for its arena tour, the genre\u2019s never been in better shape in America. The culture took off without the help of U.S. major labels or the approval of hipster festivals. But like hip-hop and EDM before it, this may be the year that K-pop becomes a permanent fixture in the U.S. music industry. Even if major labels are still figuring out what exactly to do with it. \u201cGood music and smart managers and teams will always find a way to break through, K-pop or not,\u201d Gazit said. \u201cBut one thing is certain, the limitation of taking K-pop and artists from Asia [or of] Asian descent not seriously is over.\u201d For breaking music news, follow @augustbrown on Twitter.
