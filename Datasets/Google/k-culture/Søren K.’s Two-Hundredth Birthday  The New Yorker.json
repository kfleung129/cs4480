Strindberg, Ibsen, Nietzsche, Kafka, Borges, Camus, Sartre, and Wittgenstein are among his heirs\u2014and without him, where would Woody Allen be? Kierkegaard did most of his seminal writing under assumed names: Victor Eremita (\u201cEither/Or\u201d); Johannes de Silentio (\u201cFear and Trembling\u201d); Anti-Climacus (\u201cThe Sickness Unto Death\u201d); Hilarious Bookbinder (\u201cStages on Life\u2019s Way\u201d); Vigilius Haufniensis (\u201cThe Concept of Anxiety\u201d). The point of these impostures, he explained, when he finally acknowledged them, was to disavow, or\u2014to use a postmodern notion that he pioneered\u2014to \u201cdestabilize\u201d his authority as a narrator. \u201cRevelation is marked by mystery,\u201d he wrote, \u201ceternal happiness by suffering, the certitude of faith by uncertainty, easiness by difficulty, truth by absurdity.\u201d It was not for him to dictate the meaning of a text (Kierkegaard\u2019s meanings are contradictory), but for his readers to exercise their autonomy in apprehending it. The name \u201cKierkegaard\u201d means \u201cgraveyard,\u201d and \u201cS\u00f8ren\u201d is an affectionate Danish moniker for the Devil. S\u00f8ren\u2019s father, Michael, was a former shepherd from Jutland who became, improbably, one of the richest merchants in Denmark. He had cursed God as a young man, and he later became guiltily religious. His pietism and depression (\u201ctungsind,\u201d Kierkegaard called it, heaviness of spirit) had a Jupiterian gravity that his son struggled all his life to escape. In his attacks on the Danish Church, and his heretical writings as theologian, Kierkegaard called for the individual to reject Christian dogma, and to embrace God with a \u201cleap of faith.\u201d The patriarch\u2019s shadow falls darkly on his son\u2019s work (the story of Abraham and Isaac is central to it), but Kierkegaard\u2019s mother, Ane, is never mentioned. She had been the family housemaid before Michael married her. They had seven children (S\u00f8ren was the youngest) and lost five of them. S\u00f8ren\u2019s surviving sibling, an older brother, became a bishop. His own existence as a dandy and an esthete (though also as a self-publisher) was financed, grudgingly, by his father. By the time of his death, at forty-two, in 1855, of mysterious causes, Kierkegaard had, in both senses, exhausted his patrimony. *\u00a0*\u00a0* Kierkegaard\u2019s bicentennial is being celebrated with a show of his manuscripts at the Royal Library, in Copenhagen, that runs until September, and with readings, conferences, online forums, and a contemporary radio drama, \u201cThe Kierkegaard Syndrome,\u201d about an anguished Web designer. But there has been nothing like the multi-million-dollar extravaganza that the Danes staged eight years ago, when Hans Christian Andersen turned two hundred and Tina Turner was flown in to jazz up the festivities. Instead of a rock diva, Paul Holdengr\u00e4ber, a host of literary conversations at the New York Public Library, was imported to moderate a panel on Kierkegaard with the American novelist Siri Hustvedt; the French philosopher Pascal Bruckner; and Ren\u00e9 Redzepi, the celebrity chef of Noma, the only native. Andersen, of course, has always been a global crowd-pleaser, who, as the Danes like to say, writes about \u201cthe galoshes of happiness,\u201d while Kierkegaard, who writes about \u201cthe place where the shoe hurts,\u201d is famously, if not perversely, difficult. Part of his allure for what a friend calls \u201call those smart-ass, hyper-intellectuals in Paris and Brooklyn\u201d may be that he makes the average reader feel stupid. But even Wittgenstein could say, with awe, \u201cHe is too deep for me.\u201d When I was learning Danish, I tried to read him in the original, but he is one of those rare stylists whose thought and diction are so unpredictable and rife with paradox that you can never guess a word that you don\u2019t know from its context. \u201cPeople understand me so little that they do not even understand when I complain of being misunderstood,\u201d Kierkegaard wrote in his journal. This predicament was satirized, with apt impiety, by Politiken, the leading Danish newspaper, which, on May 4th, published a sort of \u201cKierkegaard for Dummies\u201d in cartoon form. A \u201cParental Advisory\u201d warned readers about \u201cexplicit content,\u201d and not only because the cartoons were raunchy (one of the characters, a buxom female television presenter, trades oral sex for commentary from a Kierkegaard expert who looks like a monkey), but because \u201ccorrect reading of this section can lead to irreversible enlightenment.\u201d If your soul has bunions, however, reading Kierkegaard may inflame them: he invented self-doubt in its modern form. \u201cEither/Or,\u201d for example, ought really to be subtitled \u201cNeither.\u201d Kierkegaard, who has often been called the father of existentialism, champions the examined life, and the conscious choice that informs it\u2014yet he mocks choice as futile. \u201cI see it all perfectly,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere are two possible situations\u2014one can either do this or that. My honest opinion and my friendly advice is this: do it or do not do it\u2014you will regret both.\u201d (The advice was proffered, originally, to anyone contemplating marriage. In the cartoon supplement, a duck holds forth on the either/or of putting croutons in your salad.) *\u00a0*\u00a0* Before my recent visit to Copenhagen, I was last at the Royal Library in the mid-nineteen-seventies, when I spent two summers doing research for a biography of Karen Blixen. (Blixen, i.e., Isak Dinesen, probably comes third on the list of Danish writers best known to den store verden\u2014\u201cthe great world\u201d\u2014as the Danes call the real estate beyond their borders. The dialectic that Kierkegaard elaborates in \u201cEither/Or\u201d\u2014a conflict between the \u201cethical\u201d and the \u201csensuous-esthetic\u201d; the instinctual and the moral life; the artist and the bourgeois\u2014had shaped the Scandinavian culture in which she came of age.) The grand old reading room hasn\u2019t changed, except for the ubiquity of laptops\u2014I worked on index cards, with a pencil, as ink wasn\u2019t allowed. The Kierkegaard show, however, occupies a basement gallery in the 1999 extension to the 1906 edifice, which is known as the \u201cBlack Diamond.\u201d (It is a sharply angled, trapezoidal excrescence of smoky glass and marble that overlooks the water.) Vitrines that reverently display yellowed manuscripts covered with minuscule handwriting and doodles do not, generally, make for an exciting show, but Cristina Black, who designed the installation, and its curator, Bruno Svindborg, have created a dynamic, eerie spatial narrative that reminded me (sort of) of \u201cSleep No More.\u201d You descend into a long hall, claustrophobically narrow and deep. This corridor is lined with thirteen mysterious doorways, each about twelve feet high. The hand-hewn pine doors are outlined by neon-orange molding. Each leads to a darkened chamber with a surreal feature or special effect\u2014a mirrored floor; crumpled papers strewn about; a giant empty chair; electronic plopping sounds; random bric-a-brac (a toy revolver, a light bulb, rubber spiders, a Rubik\u2019s Cube) dangling from the ceiling\u2014that pertains to a period or to a theme. In the room dedicated to Kierkegaard\u2019s tormented romance with the teen-age Regine Olsen (his behavior as an \u201cout and out scoundrel,\u201d as he put it, forced her to break their engagement, and she married someone else, but they continued to love each other), the illumination comes from a blue window. But are you inside or outside? That is one of Kierkegaard\u2019s essential questions\u2014about the individual in relation to society; the mind in relation to its productions, and the nature of self. Kierkegaard was a sublime tease, like his alter ego Johannes, the narrator of \u201cThe Seducer\u2019s Diary.\u201d It is said that he did ultimately confide the meaning of life to a scrap of paper, but that scrap has never been found. Or perhaps it is sitting in a vitrine behind the last door in the corridor at the Library. You try the handle to no avail, then you notice the plaque: \u201cIngen Adgang\u201d (\u201cno entry\u201d).
