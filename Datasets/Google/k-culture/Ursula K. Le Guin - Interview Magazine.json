Le Guin\u2019s first novels\u2014set on alien planets and published as trashy head-to-toe double paperbacks by Ace Books\u2014were first unleashed almost half a century ago, in 1966. She was 36. Two years later she published A Wizard of Earthsea, the defining and enduring classic of the genre of wizards going to wizard school. The Left Hand of Darkness, the book that forced writers everywhere to examine how they wrote gender, was first published the very next year and became one of the most acclaimed books of the last century. She published a dozen books in that first decade, a pile of words built up largely during her thirties that, once released, changed the American conversation about fiction. She is the reigning queen of writing about \u201cthe nature of human nature,\u201d as Margaret Atwood once described it, in regards to Le Guin\u2019s \u201cEkumen\u201d series. Le Guin is one of the rare authors to have twice taken the Hugo and the Nebula awards in the same year. She published three stories in the New Yorker in 1982 alone. The Terrence Malick-style hiatus of 18 years between her third and fourth Earthsea novels is often referred to by authors of a beloved book when pressured for a follow-up. \u201cThe story got stuck,\u201d Le Guin wrote in her afterword to Tehanu, when it finally did appear, in 1990. \u201cI couldn\u2019t go on. It took years of living my own ordinary life and a great deal of learning how to think about such things, mostly from other women.\u201d And yet she also published seven novels, four story collections, three chapbooks and three collections of poetry, two books of criticism, and five children\u2019s books in that interval. Le Guin will be 86 this October, and is frequently referred to as \u201cthe best of\u201d for all manner of things\u2014like best fantasy writer, best science fiction writer, best female writer\u2014all of which is silly, as she both defies and accepts all categorization. Her influence on generations of readers and writers, from George R.R. Martin to Jennifer Egan to David Mitchell, is as evident as it is impossible to overstate. Admired for her quiet daring, her structures, and her inventions, most of all she is revered for her sentences. In 1998, she published Steering the Craft, a trim, little book with the subtitle Exercises and Discussions on Story Writing for the Lone Navigator or the Mutinous Crew. It was intended to teach writers how to be better writers. Finding that first edition lacking for the ever more modern age, she has now rewritten it from \u201cstem to stern\u201d with the new subtitle, \u201cA 21st-Century Guide to Sailing the Sea of Story.\u201d Le Guin and her husband of more than 60 years, Charles, live in Portland, Oregon, with a cat, now about 4 years old, named Pard. CHOIRE SICHA: Can anyone be a writer? I used to have strong opinions about this, and I feel like I\u2019ve lost them along the way. URSULA K. LE GUIN: You want strong opinions? Anybody can write. You know, one of my daughters teaches writing at a community college. She teaches kids how to put sentences together, and then make the sentences hang together so that they can express themselves in writing as well as they do in speaking. Anybody with a normal IQ can manage that. But saying anybody can be a writer is kind of like saying anybody can compose a sonata. Oh, forget it! In any art, there is an initial gift that had to be there. I don\u2019t know how big it has to be, but it\u2019s got to be there. SICHA: You can\u2019t labor your way into being a poet, can you? LE GUIN: No. You just can\u2019t. But that\u2019s not to say that being a poet doesn\u2019t take a hell of a lot of work. SICHA: It really doesn\u2019t seem that rewarding. Is that a terrible thing to say? LE GUIN: I think there are writers who don\u2019t enjoy writing, and I feel sorry for them. I love it. I don\u2019t care how hard the work is. I would rather be writing than not writing, that\u2019s all there is to it. SICHA: Poets are a special class. You\u2019re like the wild ponies of the writing world. LE GUIN: For one thing, the world of poetry that poets have to live in, of who reads them, is so small in the United States. It\u2019s not true elsewhere. But here, it\u2019s not a very big territory, and so they run around spraying the corners and defending their part of it. Poets get very territorial, and that\u2019s too bad; that\u2019s a waste of time. SICHA: They should be enjoying themselves, and it\u2019s hard to, I bet. LE GUIN: And you can\u2019t live off it. It\u2019s hard to live off of any kind of artistic writing\u2014fiction or poetry. And then you do have to wonder how many people are really reading your stuff, so the reward has to be in the work. But it is. There\u2019s nothing more rewarding than looking at a poem you wrote and thinking, \u201cWell, at least I think I did it right.\u201d SICHA: The triumph is private. LE GUIN: But it\u2019s real. It\u2019s quite real. SICHA: There\u2019s a sort of growing professional class of writers that may not have had access to being a professional. Before the internet, you would go to your terrible job and then you would write at night. I actually found that system really rewarding, separating out the money and the work. LE GUIN: On the other hand, if it was a nine-to-five job, and if you had any family obligations and commitments, it\u2019s terribly hard. It worked very much against women, because they were likely to have the nine-to-five job and really be responsible for the household. Doing two jobs is hard enough, but doing three is just impossible. And that\u2019s essentially what an awful lot of women who wanted to write were being asked to do: support themselves, keep the family and household going, and write. SICHA: And the writing was the first thing to go when things got tough, I\u2019m sure. LE GUIN: I had only a little taste of that. I did have three kids. But what my husband and I figured\u2014he was a professor and teaching a lot\u2014was that three jobs can be done by two people. He could do his job teaching, I could do my job writing, and the two of us could do the house and the kids. And it worked out great, but it took full collaboration between him and me. See, I cannot write when I\u2019m responsible for a child. They are full-time occupations for me. Either you\u2019re listening out for the kids or you\u2019re writing. So I wrote when the kids went to bed. I wrote between nine and midnight those years. And my husband would listen out if the little guy was sick or something. It worked out. It wasn\u2019t really easy but, you know, you have a lot of energy when you\u2019re young. Sometimes I look back and I think, \u201cHow the hell did we do it?\u201d But we did. SICHA: In the book you talk a lot about things sort of sentence by sentence. And I know when I get the transcript of this conversation I\u2019ll be horrified at the way I speak. I mean, you\u2019re much more articulate than I am. LE GUIN: But I will be horrified by the way I say kind of and like, and I keep qualifying everything. That\u2019s very feminine. I would like to say it plain, but it always comes out with all these silly qualifiers. There\u2019s a sentence in the book that\u2019s imitating this way of speaking because people do it in writing sometimes too, and they don\u2019t realize that they\u2019re sort of hedging their bets. But sort of, really, is just a noise to me. It\u2019s like like for a teenager, you know? SICHA: Do you have piles of terrible juvenilia all about in file folders? LE GUIN: Yes. Do not ask me to show them to anybody! I can\u2019t bear to throw them away. SICHA: It\u2019s wonderful you kept it all. LE GUIN: Well, it seems like it would be almost disrespecting my young self to just dump the stuff. I was trying. I wasn\u2019t any good, but I was trying. SICHA: This is a rude thing to say: you may want to make some choices about the conditions, if you\u2019re going to donate your things to a university or something, about how people may touch those. LE GUIN: Well, my papers are at the University of Oregon, private letters and all kinds of things. And there are, of course, restrictions on that. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do with the juvenile stuff. I just can\u2019t quite see myself burning it, which is the only alternative. SICHA: It seems so dramatic when people burn things like that. LE GUIN: It is! It\u2019s a terrible thing to do. Things get lost easy enough without their own author destroying them. I can actually put some restrictions on publication of things. I think it\u2019s terrible when they find an early novel by a famous author and dig it out and publish it as if it were something that he or she would have published, when it clearly isn\u2019t. I\u2019m a little conflicted about this whole Harper Lee business \u2026 SICHA: Oh, it all seems very strange. LE GUIN: And the weirdness going on makes me feel that there really is something wrong here. That she really didn\u2019t want the book published when she was perhaps more capable of thinking it through. But we can\u2019t tell, can we? SICHA: And the publishing industry had no qualms about publishing it either. LE GUIN: Most publishers have very few qualms. And corporate publishers these days have no qualms\u2014they don\u2019t know what a qualm is. They wouldn\u2019t know it if it hit them in the face. SICHA: Readers were delighted that The Left Hand of Darkness is finally an e-book, which it hadn\u2019t been for ages. It felt sort of bittersweet to me too. I hope the arrangement that everyone made was a happy one. LE GUIN: One reason that I was ready for it to happen and happy that it has happened is that, hopefully, it will put some of the pirates out of business. The terrible, corrupted texts that float around. Some of them are just cheats. So to have a regular, respectably published e-version of it is a good thing for almost any book. The publication history of that book is\u2014talk about weird! But I have been with a new agent the last couple of years and things are going much more rationally. SICHA: It\u2019s very important to have good counsel in this world. LE GUIN: It sure is, and that is where I sometimes tremble for the self-published people, who seem to get such various counsel that sometimes sounds to me lunatic. I hope people aren\u2019t being scammed and ripped off too much. SICHA: One day I\u2019d told a friend that I\u2019d written you a letter, and she said, \u201cI just wrote her a letter too!\u201d And we were both so happy. We expected nothing of it, of course, and I realized, thinking about that, well, it must be frightening at the other end. LE GUIN: Well, it\u2019s a lot less than it was, since more people simply don\u2019t communicate on paper. The number goes down steadily. I\u2019m kind of touched when people go through the trouble of writing me a letter instead of e-mailing me. I\u2019d actually rather do e-mail. It\u2019s a lot physically easier. You know, I\u2019m 85\u2014I look for shortcuts. But the paper mail from kids is so great. I do try to answer that. I can\u2019t keep up with it, the lovely letters people write me. But I do try to answer the kids. I really do. They\u2019re so insolent sometimes. SICHA: They\u2019re saucy? LE GUIN: Well, they tell me how I should have finished the books or what the next Catwings book ought to be or something like that. They have no inhibitions. It\u2019s cool. If I got that from a grown-up, I wouldn\u2019t think it was so cool. I\u2019d say, \u201cWrite your own book!\u201d But somebody 8 years old, they identify so passionately with what they read. You can tell. They really are into it. SICHA: Do you feel like enough of the world gets to you out there in Oregon? LE GUIN: Yeah. Too much. This is not Tierra del Fuego, you know. I get bored with the parochialness of the East Coast. They think that the news doesn\u2019t get out here and that people out here live in rustic ignorance of real life. It\u2019s embarrassing that people can be so ignorant as East Coast people tend to be of the West Coast-and the whole Midwest-and, of course, so contemptuous of the whole South. So sometimes I have written some rather resentful and snarky things about the urban Northeast-particularly in literature-the notion that nothing is worth writing about except the suburbs of large Eastern cities. Blech. That gets nowhere with me. SICHA: In the book you return to this idea of writing for art\u2019s sake, which is very much, I feel, out of vogue. We\u2019ve gotten accustomed to talking about money and the commerce of writing and how you should be treated as a writer, and it\u2019s sort of hysterical when you sit back and think about it. LE GUIN: And there are so many guidebooks to that kind of writing: \u201cHow to be a success,\u201d in other words. But I certainly didn\u2019t feel like I had anything to add there, since the way I came into writing was a pretty sure way to not be a success. SICHA: A few people may talk about the \u201ccraft of writing,\u201d but they sound phony. The way you put it is very realistic: that this is an important thing to do if you care about writing. LE GUIN: The word craft these days has this sort of funny, twee sound, like some little artisan putting the yeast in his handcrafted bread. Craft is how you do something well\u2014anything. You can do anything with craft or with skill, or without it. Writing an English sentence takes a good deal of craft and skill. Writing a good English sentence takes a lot more of it. SICHA: In the publishing industry, people tend to talk more about book proposals than books. LE GUIN: Now, you see, here\u2019s where I\u2019m really different from almost all the professional writers I know: I never sell a proposal. I\u2019ve never done it. I\u2019ve forbidden my agents to do it. I write on spec and I turn in a finished manuscript. Once or twice, when Virginia Kidd was my agent, she made a three-book deal, and so she had me committed to writing a book I hadn\u2019t written yet. I was absolutely miserable. I could barely forgive her. Somehow I managed to do it, but I just said, \u201cVirginia, never sell anything again that I haven\u2019t written or you haven\u2019t seen.\u201d She understood. People look at me with round eyes when I tell them that that\u2019s how I work. They go, \u201cHow did you ever get going?\u201d Then I have to confess: I wrote seriously for ten years before I sold anything. SICHA: I mean, that is how that is done. LE GUIN: You have to have some kind of other work to keep you going or be married to a spouse who can help you put the peanut butter on the bread. SICHA: I meet a lot of people in their twenties, and they\u2019re concerned. They want to get published, and I think, \u201cWell, hopefully you\u2019re going to live a little while. Don\u2019t walk in front of any trucks.\u201d LE GUIN: I don\u2019t think most people write very good narrative prose until they\u2019re in their later twenties. Writing is a slow art. Music can be such a fast and early art. A good musician can be just terrific at 16. But how many writers are there \u2026 I mean, even Keats is still blundering around at 16. By his early twenties, of course, he\u2019s writing immortal poetry, but there aren\u2019t a lot of Keatses, really. There\u2019s where you get \u201cgift\u201d to a degree that it\u2019s kind of like a miracle. You can\u2019t use the Keatses to talk about writing as a craft or an art or a practice or a profession. The geniuses\u2014they\u2019re off there, doing their lovely thing. SICHA: They mess up the scale for the rest of us. LE GUIN: That\u2019s okay. You just have to realize you\u2019re not going to get there, but so what? You can still do beautiful work. SICHA: There\u2019s room for plenty of people. LE GUIN: Right. And there\u2019s lots of room for just\u2014I hate to say hack writing\u2014I guess ordinary storytelling is really what I mean. There\u2019s always room for another story. There\u2019s always room for another tune, right? Nobody can write too many tunes. So if you have stories to tell and can tell them competently, then somebody will want to hear it if you tell it well at all. To believe that there is somebody who wants to hear that story is the kind of confidence a writer has to have when they\u2019re in the period of learning their craft and not selling stuff and not really knowing what they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s like being adolescent for years and years after your adolescence. SICHA: Did you sit down and write today? LE GUIN: I never had a schedule like that. If I was working on a novel, I probably would have worked from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. or so, because the novel was going and I was there to do it. But I\u2019m not really writing very much now. I don\u2019t seem to be able to write stories\u2014I know I can\u2019t write a novel, because I haven\u2019t got the physical energy. It takes huge energy to write a serious novel. Lavinia [2008] was, as far as I can see, probably it. But sometimes a story comes along. I don\u2019t sit down and write every morning, I am just more in my office at my computer. And if something is there to be written, then I will do it. And poetry comes when it wants to \u2026 There\u2019s a sort of readiness, I think, that is part of a professional writer\u2019s equipment. Some little corner of them is always ready and listening for the incoming story or the incoming poem or the incoming idea. SICHA: You allude to that in the latest postscript to The Left Hand of Darkness, when you say that you would hear things\u2014that you would listen. And you say this about characters too, that the characters come and they tell you what\u2019s happening. You said something along those lines when you returned to Earthsea, too. LE GUIN: It is a state of openness and readiness that runs all through my practice of writing. That, I suppose, is one reason why I\u2019m simply unwilling to commit myself to writing a book that isn\u2019t written yet. To me, that sort of shuts doors. I have to write this book, but I haven\u2019t written it yet. I can\u2019t be in this state of complete readiness for whatever signal comes in from wherever if I have a project that has to be of a certain kind. Does that make sense? SICHA: Unfortunately, yes. LE GUIN: This is true of me. This is simply not true of many writers. I\u2019m at one end of a spectrum here. SICHA: Some of us simply can\u2019t take orders. LE GUIN: I believe most of the editors I\u2019ve worked with would say that I\u2019m pretty reasonable. But they\u2019re not giving orders; they\u2019re collaborating. A good editor does not say, \u201cCut that!\u201d Good editors collaborate with a writer. They say, \u201cYou know, that isn\u2019t really clear, is it?\u201d And you say, \u201cWell, no. Hell, it isn\u2019t.\u201d I\u2019m not a sort of willful loner in that sense. I have, after all, had a long time to learn. I started writing when I was 5 and I\u2019m 85. I have learned how I work best, and that is something that, if you\u2019re going to be a professional writer, you should be noticing: under what circumstances you work at your best, and to not get yourself cornered into writing in a way that doesn\u2019t let you do your best. SICHA: You have to find that spot for yourself. LE GUIN: And there will be one. Writing is a broad field with all kinds of outlets and publications and publishers and readers. There will be somewhere where you fit. But don\u2019t let them crowd you into a place where you don\u2019t belong or think you have to do it a certain way that isn\u2019t quite natural to you. SICHA: I\u2019m selfishly sad but also impressed that you feel like you don\u2019t have a novel that you can tackle, that you don\u2019t have the energy for it. LE GUIN: It does not make me happy. And I don\u2019t like saying it. I think writing a novel that\u2019s going well is about the best kind of work I ever did. And the most satisfying. But I\u2019m just glad now that I can sort of keep going with what I do. SICHA: The blog [which Le Guin keeps on her site and at Book View Caf\u00e9] is such a good form for you! LE GUIN: It\u2019s the only place I do feedback. The input is fascinating. I don\u2019t often answer it, but it\u2019s interesting to see what people get interested in, what excites people. SICHA: It\u2019s like you have a little crowd, but they\u2019re just outside, so they don\u2019t have to be in your house. LE GUIN: I did that introversion/extroversion test once long ago, and I was just off the charts on introvert. I was slightly inhuman. It was sort of scary. SICHA: But you didn\u2019t get zero on empathy. LE GUIN: Oh no! That was never the problem. SICHA: You just need some time to be alone. LE GUIN: I just need solitude.
