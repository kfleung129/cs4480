While the annual rumors that we\u2019re running out of wings simply aren\u2019t true, wings have indeed\u00a0become the most expensive part of the chicken\u00a0due to their popularity when fried and covered in buffalo sauce. Few of us realize, though, that less than 50 years ago,\u00a0wings were considered one of the least desirable cuts of the chicken\u2014a throwaway part often cooked into stock\u2014and \u201cbuffalo\u201d was just a wooly ungulate that wandered the Plains. Despite the recency of the invention, the\u00a0event itself is shrouded in mystery. Nevertheless, there is one thing we know for certain: the \u201cbuffalo\u201d in the name definitively refers to the city in Western New York. The most authoritative account is by\u00a0New Yorker\u00a0writer Calvin Trillin, who investigated the dish\u2019s history in 1980 as he sampled the city\u2019s most well-regarded wing joints. He presented two competing versions of how a stroke of serendipity led Teressa Bellissimo, proprietor of the Anchor Bar, to invent the dish in 1964. Her husband Frank Bellissimo, who founded the bar with Teressa in 1939, told Trillin that the invention involved a mistake\u2014the delivery of chicken wings, instead of necks, which the family typically used when cooking up spaghetti sauce. To avoid wasting the wings, he asked Teressa to concoct a bar appetizer; the result was the wing we know today. Dominic\u2014Frank and Teressa\u2019s son, who took over management of the restaurant sometime in the \u201970s\u2014told a slightly more colorful tale: It was late on a Friday night in 1964, a time when Roman Catholics still confined themselves to fish and vegetables on Fridays\u2026Some regulars had been spending a lot of money, and Dom asked his mother to make something special to pass around gratis at the stroke of midnight. Teressa Bellissimo picked up some chicken wings\u2014parts of a chicken that most people do not consider even good enough to give away to barflies\u2014and the Buffalo chicken wing was born. Both Frank and Dominic agreed on a few other crucial details\u2014that Teressa cut each wing in half to produce a \u201cdrumstick\u201d and a \u201cflat,\u201d that she deep-fried them without breading and covered them in a hot sauce, and that she served them with celery (from the house antipasto) and blue cheese salad dressing. They also both reported that they became popular within weeks throughout the city, where they were (and are still) simply called \u201cwings\u201d or \u201cchicken wings.\u201d But there are even more competing versions of the story. John E. Harmon, a professor of geography at Central Connecticut State University who wrote the\u00a0Atlas of Popular Culture in the Northeastern United States\u00a0as a sabbatical project, writes that Teressa actually improvised the recipe to serve Dominic and a group of his friends when they ambled into the bar late at night. The most dissimilar account is also mentioned by Trillin, who wrote that on his trip to Buffalo, he met a man named John Young who bluntly stated,\u00a0\u201cI am actually the creator of the wing.\u201d Young points out that growing up in an African-American community, he\u2019d frequently eaten chicken wings as a standard dish; what he invented was a\u00a0special \u201cmambo sauce\u201d for the wings he served at his restaurant, John Young\u2019s Wings \u2019n Things, during the mid-\u201960s. But he served his wings breaded and whole (rather than chopped into flats and drumsticks), distinctions that suggest to many wing traditionalists that they belong to an entire different category. While it\u2019s uncertain which creation myth is most accurate, what happened over the next few decades is clear: buffalo chicken wings exploded in popularity across the country. During the 70\u2032s, the recipe spread to other eateries in the city and state\u2014Duff\u2019s, an early adopter, remains a favorite wing joint of many Buffalonians\u2014then went national with the founding of chains like Wings N\u2019Curls in Florida. Harmon reports that Trillin\u2019s article itself sparked further interest, as did the 1983 founding of Hooter\u2019s, which featured wings at the center of its menu. In 1994, Domino\u2019s spent $32 million advertising their national roll-out of wings, and Pizza Hut quickly followed suit. Since, the growth of chains like Buffalo Wild Wings and the placement of wings on countless local menus means that they\u2019re essentially available anywhere in the United States. They\u2019re gradually penetrating international markets, too, with\u00a0Buffalo Wild Wings planning to open locations\u00a0in Dubai, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia later this year. Nowadays, buffalo sauce has gone beyond wings\u2014it\u2019s\u00a0frequently used for boneless chicken fingers and\u00a0pizzas, and\u00a0gas stations sell everything from buffalo-flavored\u00a0Combos\u00a0to\u00a0Pringles. In Buffalo, though, wings are still eaten roughly the way they were invented by Teressa in 1964: served in either hot, medium or mild buffalo sauce,\u00a0with blue cheese and celery.
