Paradise Co Ltd and Japanese partner Sega Sammy Holdings Inc are set to break ground in October on the country\u2019s first integrated casino resort. Their Paradise City project near South Korea\u2019s main Incheon airport should open in early 2017, a year ahead of a nearby project planned by U.S.-based Caesars Entertainment Corp and Hong Kong\u2019s Lippo Ltd. The company is banking on South Korea\u2019s proximity to northeast China and the popularity of Korean culture as a draw for Chinese gamblers who bet billions in places like Macau. The number of Chinese tourists to South Korea grew nearly 53 percent last year. South Korea\u2019s total casino revenue was about $2.5 billion in 2013, less than 6 percent of Macau\u2019s. \u201cThere will be more rich people in China, and they will need to travel,\u201d Choi Jong-hwan, CEO of Paradise Sega Sammy Co, said in an interview. \u201cThis is a megatrend.\u201d Investors have sent Paradise shares up more than sevenfold since the start of 2011, the year the Seoul-based company tied up with Sega Sammy. Last month, Paradise raised 285.8 billion won ($276.54 million) in a sale of treasury shares. The joint venture plans to open the first phase of the resort with casino, hotel, shopping, entertainment and convention facilities, at a cost of about 1 trillion won. The phase will include 120 tables, 400 slot machines and 300 electronic gaming tables, small by the standards of mega-resorts elsewhere. Choi said the company will also rely on junket operators to bring in 20-30 percent of its business, compared to the current 5 percent at its other casinos. Junket operators bring in high-rollers from China. The resort will also play up its \u201cKorean-ness\u201d because \u201cKorea is a hot place right now,\u201d Choi said. \u201cThe main content that we will be showing to the Chinese VIPs will be Korean culture,\u201d such as K-pop and local food, he said. The conservative Korean culture at the moment has mostly kept South Koreans from fully enjoying gambling. The country\u2019s only \u201copen\u201d casino at which Koreans can gamble is in a remote ex-mining town three hours from Seoul. But the casino, operated by Kangwon Land Inc, earned 1.28 trillion won ($1.24 billion) in revenue last year, nearly equal the 1.37 trillion won earned in the country\u2019s 16 smaller foreigner-only casinos. South Korea also faces potential competition from neighbouring Japan, which may open the country to casino gambling by 2020. \u201cMany of the Koreans will be travelling into Japan to play the casinos and at that time, maybe the Korean government could be thinking of putting in an \u2018open\u2019 casino,\u201d Choi said. Choi said Paradise City is not planned with the expectation that South Korea will eventually allow locals, but others say they see little chance the socially conservative country will ease the ban. The relatively small size of the planned resorts is also a drawback, said Seo Won-seok, a professor of hotel and tourism management at Kyung Hee University. \u201cThe integrated resorts planned for South Korea aren\u2019t landmarks like Marina Bay Sands (in Singapore). These are small resorts that won\u2019t be able to draw the crowd by their presence alone,\u201d he said. Others are hoping he\u2019s wrong. A consortium of Genting Singapore Plc and Landing International Development Ltd plans a $2.2 billion casino resort on Jeju Island, a southern tourist spot popular with Chinese visitors, although those plans have been slowed by local opposition. Global operators like Las Vegas Sands and Melco Crown have also expressed interest in South Korea, if locals are allowed to gamble. 1 US dollar = 1,033.50 Korean won Additional reporting by Farah Master; Editing by Tony Munroe and Matt Driskill Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
