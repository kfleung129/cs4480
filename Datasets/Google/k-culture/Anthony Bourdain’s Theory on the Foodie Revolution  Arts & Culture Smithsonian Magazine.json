I\u2019m speaking of the fetishization of food, of cooking and eating, of watching other people cooking and eating, that has become omnipresent across all platforms, all media, all screens and all palates in our great nation. \u201cTop Chef,\u201d \u201cMasterChef,\u201d \u201cCake Boss,\u201d the entire Food Network. Travel shows that are mainly about watching foreign people eat foreign food. Barbecue madness. Raw and locavore. The taco truck as the new gourmet temple, Artisanal Whole Foodism, fonio as the next quinoa (don\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t know about fonio!). Along with all of this has been the transformation in the status of the chef from behind-the-scenes pot-stirrer to culinary rock star. And in this particular cultural revolution the original rock star, the Elvis of bad boy chefs, is Anthony Bourdain. He achieved his breakthrough with a sensational book called\u00a0Kitchen Confidential, a surprise worldwide best seller about the frenzied, obscenity-laced, sex-and-drug-fueled back-burner ballet of tattooed pirates who brandish spatulas like swords. He went on to be a fixture on the Food Network, on \u201cTop Chef,\u201d paired with domestic goddess Nigella Lawson on \u201cThe Taste,\u201d while somehow maintaining a globe-trotting food and travel show on CNN called \u201cParts Unknown.\u201d When he arrives for our lunch at Ristorante Morini, a stylish but understated Manhattan restaurant run by a chef friend of his, Bourdain looks a lot less funky and downtown than in his youth. He\u2019s a large, husky man with the suave, silvery look of a KGB hit man. Perhaps the KGB vibe is not accidental. Before our appetizers arrive we\u2019re deep into a conversation about our mutual interest in espionage lore and he\u2019s telling me about the time he slept with the daughter of one of the most notorious KGB defectors in cold war history, Anatoliy Golitsyn. \u201cGolitsyn\u2019s daughter....Lesbian....Beautiful, incredibly beautiful. Object of just insane, obsessive love by many women at Vassar,\u201d he claims. \u201cShe died of an OD.\u201d It\u2019s this kind of acquaintance with the dark side that gives Bourdain, a former heroin addict himself, his bad boy reputation. His post-Vassar career included a stint at the CIA\u2014not the one in Langley but the prestigious Culinary Institute of America\u2014and then some wild summers at Cape Cod lobster trap restaurants, a dive into the downtown depravity of SoHo kitchens, addiction, recovery and the launch of the restaurant he\u2019s most associated with, Les Halles, an old-fashioned French workingman\u2019s place that grew to be a worldwide chain and still serves a great cassoulet in its original location on Park Avenue in New York City. And then the book. This is the other side of Bourdain: the serious writer. And the other side of his signature gonzo literary style is something that has been less recognized: Kitchen Confidential is one of the few books in recent American literature to capture the communal ecstasy of Work. American writers rarely write about work anymore. Not tech work, quant work, digital work, but real work, manual work, crew work, often skilled but sweaty. Bourdain\u2019s depiction of the kitchen crews he worked on, their mad camaraderie and the kind of inspired improvisational feats of high-heat athleticism they performed are tours de force. They reminded me of the early sequence of Theodore Dreiser\u2019s great novel An American Tragedy, where a naive kid gets his first job as a hotel bellboy and Dreiser captures the adrenaline-fueled world of the backstairs hotel hierarchy. I try out my theory about writing and work on him. \u201cLook,\u201d he replies, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do it, but in some way I think the book gave voice to a certain strata of working cooks who were not ever going to be stars, they weren\u2019t going to end up on TV. But over the years I\u2019ve seen a rise in their self-esteem and sense of self-worth. There\u2019s a pirate camaraderie that I think was always there, but now maybe I helped put a name to. That could be a good thing or a bad thing. A lot of people like the book for the wrong reasons.\u201d \u201cWhat are the wrong reasons?\u201d \u201cA lot of people think it\u2019s OK to get f--ked up and work. Kitchen Confidential was not a story about a particularly good or commendable career. It was my life; I wrote it in a way that made it sound like a lot of fun, but obviously it wasn\u2019t. I think a lot of people tend to overlook that. It validates a lot of bad behavior.\u201d \u201cPeople responded to the joyousness, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Cooking, he says, can \u201cdevelop this glorious culture that values certain things. Firemen have that same sort of thing\u2014there\u2019s us and f--k everyone else. Cop culture, people who are doing difficult things who are used to being under-appreciated....You develop a unit pride that allows you to transcend the overwhelming likelihood that the mission is doomed, OK?\u201d OK! But how does he explain the massive audience for these shows, the desire to watch and salivate over others making food. He has an interesting theory: homesickness. \u201cThere are huge populations of people who move from the country to the city who, for them, I guess the Food Network is nesting. It\u2019s evoking a family life, a kitchen table that they probably never had, or maybe only had briefly. I think that\u2019s an international thing. But now I don\u2019t know because people don\u2019t really cook on TV anymore. There\u2019re very few shows where they actually dump and stir. Now it\u2019s doing stuff like having contests and...even the ones where they\u2019re actually cooking, it\u2019s more about interpersonal drama, like a reality show. Look, it\u2019s a mystery to me. \u201cI mean, I like watching really good food porn,\u201d he continues. \u201cBeautiful food that I know what it is, I know what they\u2019re making, or I\u2019m curious about the culture it\u2019s coming from. I could watch that all day. I like watching food porn, I like making food porn for people who are really all about the food and learning about food or imagining about food.\u201d But not Instagramming food. He has strong feelings about the craze of Instagramming dishes that has taken over social media. \u201cChefs bitch about it when it\u2019s going on in their restaurants,\u201d Bourdain says, \u201cyet when they go out to dinner, they\u2019re taking pictures of everything. And any notion that that\u2019s sharing? It\u2019s bullshit. It\u2019s about making other people feel bad about what they\u2019re eating. And a certain knowledge that what you\u2019re eating is more interesting.\u201d He has a theory about this I hadn\u2019t considered. That the whole seismic food culture shift isn\u2019t American superficiality but the New World learning what the Old World has known for centuries. \u201cWe\u2019re just catching on,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are changing societally, and our values are changing, so that we are becoming more like Italians and Chinese and Thais and Spaniards, where we actually think about what we\u2019re eating, what we ate last night, and what we\u2019re considering eating tomorrow. When I grew up in the \u201960s, we\u2019d go to see a movie, then we would go to a restaurant. And we would talk about the movie we just saw. Now, you go right to dinner and you talk about the dinner you had last week and the dinner you\u2019re going to have next week, while you\u2019re taking pictures of the dinner you\u2019re having now. That\u2019s a very Italian thing. A lot of the sort of hypocrisy and silliness and affectation of current American food culture is just fits and starts, awkwardly and foolishly growing into a place where a lot of older cultures have been for quite some time.\u201d Along with that, he says, is the evolution of the American palate. \u201cAs a general statement, our palates are changing. We\u2019ve seen a few really big moments just in the last 30, 40 years. The moment Americans decided that raw fish was desirable. Huge! Nothing could be more repulsive to the traditional American table than raw fish. And yet suddenly, very quickly, we all wanted it. It doesn\u2019t really matter why\u2014whether it was because we saw Sarah Jessica Parker eating it on TV or it was just brightly colored, or we were drunk. Whatever. Suddenly now we like it.\u201d And there\u2019s the realm beyond raw\u2014the one he calls \u201cthe funk zone, the rot zone.\u201d \u201cOne of the most serious things happening now is people like Korean food now. Clearly that funk zone, the rot zone, the kimchi zone people have learned in their lifetimes to like. People are learning to like liver and kidneys. They\u2019re learning to enjoy textures that would have been profoundly repulsive to them earlier in their lives.\u201d \u201cWhat kind of textures?\u201d \u201cRubbery, chewy, cartilagey, fatty, tendon, jellyfish, pig\u2019s tail, pig\u2019s ears. Very hot item on menus now, pig\u2019s ears.\u201d \u201cPig\u2019s ears? Is that true?\u201d \u201cYeah, serious hipster cred. And I think another huge thing is how spicy they\u2019re willing to accept their food. We have entered a new zone of true scaldingly, spicy, hot food.\u201d \u201cDo you think there are tastes that we have not yet gotten to, that are still awaiting us?\u201d \u201cWell, we\u2019ve embraced umami [the Japanese term for their version of the savory and pungent funk zone] in a big way. Lot of chef research going on in that subject. And people like their sushi older.\u201d \u201cWhoa, wait a minute. Sushi older?\u201d \u201cLots of people have begun to understand that sushi has almost nothing to do with freshness. It\u2019s all about the sweet spot during its decay.\u201d It\u2019s a great line, \u201cthe sweet spot during its decay.\u201d But it doesn\u2019t make me want to run out for aged raw mackerel. \u201cI think we\u2019re reaching our human potential, food-wise.\u201d He conceded in one of his later books, No Reservations, that he reached his limit when he agreed to share rotting shark innards with the locals in Iceland. Even as he speaks of it a shadow of horror crosses his face. I ask him if he thinks the revolution or obsession we\u2019re going through with food is as meaningful as rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, or psychedelic mind expansion, or various spiritualities. Is it a genuine cultural revolution or just a wave of self-indulgence? \u201cIt is powerful,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat it does have something in common at its best with rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, with great rock \u2019n\u2019 roll: There\u2019s a sense that somebody\u2019s talking to you. You used to get an old 331\u20443, you\u2019d listen to the music and if it moved you, then you\u2019d go, \u2018Wow!\u2019 What else were they trying to say to you? And you\u2019d pore over the cover and the back liner and say, \u2018I want more. Someone\u2019s talking to me and I want to make sure I understand.\u2019\u201d Bourdain sounds like he\u2019s describing a consciousness raising, an expansive way of connecting more deeply with other people. He\u2019s almost evangelical about it. \u201cThe little moments that I have regularly in places like Saudi Arabia, Palestine, Libya, Borneo, Barcelos in Brazil, Liberia, the Congo\u2014the moment they\u2019re looking at you and you put your hand in [a repugnant-looking offering] and you eat and you experience that thing with them. You share an intimate moment. You can\u2019t say, \u2018No, it\u2019s OK. I\u2019ll pass.\u2019 If you blow that moment, it\u2019s done. They\u2019re not telling you the interesting thing they might have said afterwards. Because you\u2019re rejecting everything they love. You\u2019re rejecting their mom. It\u2019s a simple thing. But openness to that, simply a willingness to say, \u2018I\u2019ll have that; I\u2019m interested. Wow, where\u2019d you get that?\u2019 Then people tell you.\u201d For someone who comes across a bit like a wise ass cynic in his books, someone who might scoff, Bourdain offers what seems like a genuinely idealistic take on it all: the spiritual globalism, you might say, at the heart of the food frenzy culture. *** The food we were eating was simple but perfect. For the record Bourdain ordered terrine and Garganelli, a classic pasta Bolognese, while I had that as a side dish and chicken as my entree. I almost never order chicken, finding it almost always boring, but it was probably the best chicken I can recall having, uncomplicated but flawless. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how excited I was to eat this,\u201d he says gesturing to his pasta. \u201cA properly sauced Bolognese out of even a chipped bowl with a hunk of bread, I could have wept with joy. Because it\u2019s a simple good thing. Like \u2018Jumpin\u2019 Jack Flash\u2019 or sex, it\u2019s good, it will always be good.\u201d \u201cWhat do you think of restaurant culture these days? Has it gotten more civilized or has it gotten too ridiculous?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s better because the inmates are running the asylum now. In my day you had to convince somebody. Let\u2019s say you were a talented kid, over eight years you worked your way up to sous-chef; ten years you became chef de cuisine at a good restaurant with a reputation. Based on that reputation and your experience, you were able to talk some credulous investor into fronting you a million dollars to open up a brick-and-mortar place somewhere, hopefully in a good location, where you had maybe a 10 to 20 percent chance of ever making a dollar. Now though, a talented kid, maybe you worked at a few good restaurants for a while but you have an interesting background\u2014maybe mom was Korean, dad was Mexican, you grew up in Koreatown in L.A. with a Mexican neighborhood next-door. You borrow 50 grand, get yourself a food truck, go out and make interesting food. People love it, you spread the word over social media, then you get four trucks. Roy Choi now has five or six restaurants and a hotel. He started out with a truck making Korean tacos. \u201cA lot of old-school guys complain about this\u2014you\u2019re not paying your dues. That\u2019s the downside. The upside is interesting people with something to say and a unique worldview can actually get their name out there and open a place with relative ease compared to the way it used to be.\u201d I asked him about his most remarkable experiences in his \u201cParts Unknown\u201d show. \u201cThe Congo was far and away the hardest, the most difficult, the most frightening. You\u2019re robbed or extorted or threatened twice a day. There are 29 different militias, all of whom are capable of spectacular violence and atrocity, but really the worst-case scenario is that the good guys show up. If the cops and the army show up, then you\u2019re really f--ked. Then it\u2019s time to really run. It was a gorgeous, heartbreaking place, excruciatingly difficult to shoot, but every minute of every day we knew we were telling a really important story that nobody else was telling.\u201d Of course it\u2019s not all unmixed fun. After all his tales of eating rotting shark, drinking pig\u2019s blood, and the rot zone, he reveals the one thing he fears. It came when I ask him about my own b\u00eate noire: parasites. \u201cNever had one.\u201d \u201cReally? How could that be? You must have like the most amazing immune system.\u201d \u201cGood stomach flora,\u201d he agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s been 14 years on the road, all over the world.\u201d There is one, however, that he fears more than any other: \u201cWe don\u2019t want Guinea worm, that\u2019s something I really prefer to not have.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of Guinea worm.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a six-foot-tall, subcutaneous worm that travels around right under the skin layer. Pops its head out now and again. It drives you to the bathroom, you have an overwhelming need to bathe all the time. It used to be a huge killer in Africa. Jimmy Carter\u2019s been very helpful in ameliorating that. In the old days, you\u2019d stick a toothpick through it and try to reel the whole thing out without breaking it, which would cause this necrotic worm to rot in your skin, resulting in septicemia.\u201d But he keeps at it, for one thing because he has a larger vision in mind. He\u2019s a fanatic film buff and his \u201cParts Unknown\u201d episodes give him the opportunity to indulge his directorial fantasies. This came up when he was complaining about food writers carping about the \u201cgolden hued Terrence Malick moment\u201d that often appears in \u201cParts Unknown\u2019s\u201d treks through the wilds that Malick loves to film. \u201cAre you a big Malick fan?\u201d \u201cHuge. One of the great joys of my life is being able [in \u201cParts Unknown\u201d] to rip off these great films, many of which most of our audiences have never seen, but we know. So me and my shooters, we talk a lot about films we love, many of them very obscure, and how we\u2019re going to just get that look. Often where we can get that look. Like we\u2019ll go someplace to do a show; we\u2019ll decide on the location after we\u2019ve decided on the film we want to rip off. \u201c[Directors] like Christopher Doyle, Wong Kar-wai, In the Mood for Love being a particularly good example. Shinya Tsukamoto\u2019s sort of violent, ultra-violent Japanese work. Seijun Suzuki, early Robert Rodriguez, Terrence Malick we rip off a lot. Some of Stephen Soderbergh\u2019s work as far as color values. Early Antonioni, we\u2019ve ripped off shamelessly.\u201d \u201cAnd we\u2019ve actually started getting like A-list Hollywood directors and cinematographers saying, \u2018Can I come out and play with you guys? Like could I shoot an episode? I\u2019ll do it for f--kin\u2019 scale,\u2019 which is great. I mean, I\u2019ll tell you. I\u2019m bragging\u2014Darren Aronofsky called up.\u201d Bourdain is living the dream. The true pirate life financed by Hollywood. And indeed it\u2019s interesting to think of food as the center of a new artistic genre. It all comes together in a way with his tribute to rice culture and the ultimate rice culture film. His love of the simple beauty of rice culture is a deep one. He loves Vietnam and Cambodia, for instance. He\u2019s even gone so far as to have sit-downs with former Vietcong and Khmer Rouge Cambodians. \u201cThis weekend I\u2019m heading off for Vietnam. Love it. First love. It\u2019s f--king beautiful. Any rice culture is beautiful.\u201d\nAny rice culture? \u201cIt\u2019s super-intricate. Just the irrigation systems, the level of cooperation with your neighbors. You need to manipulate the water levels, every little thing. Rice has something magical about it. Rice is an explanation for everything.\u201d It dawned on me that \u201crice culture\u201d embodies his celebration of communal work one finds all the way back in Kitchen Confidential. It figures in his conception of how he\u2019d like his life to end. As our lunch concludes I ask my last question, the traditional question asked of chefs and death row inmates: \u201cWhat would you like your last meal to be?\u201d \u201cEasy. Sukiyabashi Jiro in Tokyo. A sushi place. I\u2019m eating 25 of them. Twenty-five courses in 22 minutes. So perfect.\u201d \u201cWhat makes it so perfect? \u201cDid you see the film Jiro Dreams of Sushi?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cWatch the film and you will understand. It is an 88-year-old man doing the same basic 30 or 40 basic cuts of Edo-style sushi, meaning nothing innovative. Every night he\u2019s been going to sleep for his entire life; how do I make that standard shrimp over rice better, better, better, better? \u201cIt\u2019s about the rice. It\u2019s an explanation of...everything. And sort of a tragedy and an inspiring...and also tragedy. The son\u2019s 55\u2014and they\u2019re toasting the seaweed outside in the cellar\u2014not yet trusted to take the helm! But it\u2019s an extraordinary piece of work and really one of the most deeply satisfying perfect meals I\u2019ve ever had. Stripped of everything, every nonessential ingredient. \u201cYou eat with your hands. You sit down, right in front of him, you look him in the eyes and pick it up and put it in your mouth. Two minutes later another thing goes down, you pick it up.\u201d I like that, don\u2019t you? \u201cRice is magical. Rice is an explanation of everything.\u201d\b Get the latest Travel & Culture stories in your inbox.
