By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJeff Benjamin Just as Billboard gears up to launch its annual Women in Music celebration, one of K-pop\u2019s top females adds another accomplishment to her K-Pop Hot 100 2013 hat trick. Leader of girl group SISTAR, Hyorin, had already had earned No. 1s with her group, in the duo sub-unit project SISTAR19\u00a0and with a soundtrack single this year alone. Now, she adds another No. 1 with her proper solo debut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tExplore\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tExplore\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee latest videos, charts and news\n\n\n\nSee latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news \u201cOne Way Love,\u201d the rocking, Brave Brothers-produced confection, rockets to the top for a No. 1 debut on the K-Pop chart. The R&B-influenced \u201cLonely,\u201d the other single Hyorin is promoting, lands at No. 3.\u00a0\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBTS' V Drops Two Very Different Remixes of 'Slow Dancing' Solo Single\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t12/09/2013 Incredibly, with \u201cOne Way Love\u201d Hyorin earns her seventh overall No. 1 on the chart. While specific No. 1s are only credited to the specific act promoting the single (SISTAR\u2019s No. 1s do not officially count for each member), it\u2019s become clear the K-diva knows the projects to which she should attach her name. With four weeks with SISTAR19\u2019s \u201cGone Not Around Any Longer\u201d at No. 1 along with a week for SISTAR\u2019s \u201cGive It to Me,\u201d soundtrack single \u201cCrazy of You\u201d and this week\u2019s chart topper, Hyorin has spent seven weeks at the top of the K-Pop chart this year. In addition to covering Beyonce last week, the 22-year-old has unleashed yet another English pop performance. This time, she tackled Christina Aguilera\u2019s \u201cShow Me How You Burlesque,\u201d off the vocal powerhouse\u2019s 2010 movie \u201cBurlesque.\u201d  With Hyorin zooming to No. 1, 2NE1\u2019s \u201cMissing You\u201d has to spend a second week at the No. 2 position. Fans should not fret too much as the winter ballad is showing stronger staying power than the fierce foursome\u2019s previous 2013 singles \u201cFalling in Love\u201d and \u201cDo You Love Me.\u201d Also, as noted below, interest has not waned for the sentimental (and at times, nude!) visual. The video for \u201cMissing You\u201d spends another week on Billboard\u2019s YouTube chart. Watch a new live performance of \u201cMissing You\u201d below from K-pop music chart program \u201cM COUNTDOWN.\u201d  While Noel\u2018s \u201cWhen The Night Comes\u201d drops out of the Top 10 this week \u2014 and lands at No. 26 \u2014 the official single, \u201cBeing Forgotten\u201d off new EP \u201cTrace,\u201d skyrockets to No. 8 this week. \u201cBeing Forgotten\u201d is a soft, piano-driven ballad crafted by Choi Kyusung, the producer behind Noel\u2019s K-Pop Hot 100 No. 1 \u201cI Miss You.\u201d Through the track, the group boasts its extensive emotional palette, illustrating a man\u2019s heartbreak over not only losing his love but also forgetting about the relationship entirely. Watch the official music video below:  K-pop fans will notice an old Christmas favorite re-entering the chart this week. IU\u2019s \u201cEarly Merry Christmas,\u201d featuring MBLAQ member Thunder, was originally released in December 2010, packaged with IU\u2019s \u201cReal\u201d EP. The K-Pop princess layers her sweet vocals over an electro-pop production while Thunder adds in a few rap lines, giving the song a bit of a hip-hop edge. Earlier this year, Busker Busker\u2019s 2012 chart topper \u201cCherry Blossom Ending\u201d \u2014 a bouncy indie track now representative of spring in South Korea \u2014 made a resurgence on the charts and eventually found itself back at No. 1. If the public decides IU\u2019s \u201cEarly Merry Christmas\u201d will be its quintessential holiday track this year \u2014 three years later \u2014 it\u2019s not proposterous to think IU could find herself atop the K-Pop Hot 100 again if people start re-streaming the song and downloading it as their ringtone. Watch a classic performance of the holiday tune below:  K-Pop on Other Billboard Charts:\u2014YouTube:\u00a02NE1\u2019s \u201cMissing You\u201d spends another week at No. 21, after debuting at the same position last week.\u2014Japan Hot 100:\u00a0Two holiday entries zoom into the chart this week with \u201cVery Merry Xmas\u201d by TVXQ!
