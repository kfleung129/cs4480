    "text": "Absorbing tale of people deciding to freeze themselves until a better world arrives.    I\u2019m Jim McKeown, welcome to Likely Stories, a weekly review of fiction, non-fiction, poetry, and biographies. Although not an avid fan of Don DeLillo, I have read a few of his novels without the urge to read all his works.\u00a0 I have ranged from red hot, Underworld to luke-cold, Libra.\u00a0 When I saw his latest novel, Zero K, the jacket prompted me to buy it.\u00a0 I am glad I did.\u00a0 While not as sweeping as Underworld, I found the premise and the prose most intriguing. Don DeLillo is an American novelist, playwright, and essayist.\u00a0 Significantly, to me, his listed influences are Pynchon, Hemingway, Faulkner, Nabokov, Dostoyevsky, and last, but certainly not least, James Joyce.\u00a0 This is powerhouse-central for my reading satisfaction.\u00a0\u00a0 I last read most of these authors before the beginning of \u201cLikely Stories,\u201d so I must dig some up for much needed second readings. Zero K tells the story of Ross Lockhart and his second wife, Artis, and his son Jeffrey from his first marriage to Madeline.\u00a0 Ross has amassed a huge fortune, but Artis is dying of cancer.\u00a0 He becomes involved as an investor in a program known as the \u201cConvergence.\u201d\u00a0 This organization, hidden deep underground somewhere in central Asia, has developed a process for preserving a body in deep freeze -- hence \u201czero K\u201d for zero degrees Kelvin, or absolute zero.\u00a0 When Jeffrey learns of this plan he is, at first intrigued, but when he learns his father will join Artis even though he is not ill, he becomes horrified.\u00a0 To make matters worse, Artis and Ross ask Jeffrey to \u201cgo with them,\u201d even though he is perfectly healthy. DeLillo\u2019s prose has an urgency to it, as he slowly unveils secrets about the organization.\u00a0 Jeffrey has had some personal difficulties lately, and he is also looking for a \u201cnew world.\u201d\u00a0 Much of the novel involves discussions and speculation about death, time, re-birth, and immortality. Jeffrey, the narrator, wanders around the complex and attends lectures for family members of patients who about to die.\u00a0 Few of these people have names, but Jeffrey wants to give each a name.\u00a0 DeLillo writes, \u201cArtis has spoken about being artificially herself.\u00a0 Was this the character, the half fiction who would soon be transformed. Or reduced, or intensified, becoming pure self, suspended in ice?\u00a0 I didn\u2019t want to think about it.\u00a0 I wanted to think about a name for the woman [speaker]. // She spoke, with pauses, about the nature of time.\u00a0 What happens to the idea of continuum \u2013 past present, future \u2013 in the cryonic chamber?\u00a0 Will you understand days, years and minutes?\u00a0 Will this faculty diminish and die?\u00a0 How human are you without your sense of time?\u00a0 More human than ever?\u00a0 Or do you become fetal, an unborn thing? // She looked at Miklos Szabo, the Old World professor, and I imagined him in a three-piece suit, someone from the 1930s, a renowned philosopher having an illicit romance with a woman named Magda. // \u2018Time is too difficult,\u2019 he said\u201d (67-68). With a number of states allowing a patient to make the decision to end his or her life, this topic has been on my mind whenever I see a friend or family member kept alive with machines.\u00a0 Don DiLillo\u2019s latest novel, Zero K, is an excellent story to spark a discussion about the end of life.\u00a0 5 stars. Likely Stories is a production of KWBU.\u00a0 Join me again next time for Likely Stories, and happy reading! ",
