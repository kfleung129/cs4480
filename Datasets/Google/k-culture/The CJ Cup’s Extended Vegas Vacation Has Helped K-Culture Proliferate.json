(Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images) A Korean conglomerate is hosting the CJ Cup this weekend on the heels of a massive moment for the country\u2019s golf clout. Last Sunday for the first time Korean players won simultaneously on the world\u2019s top golf tours. Sunjae Im topped the leaderboard at the Shriners Children\u2019s Open while red-hot Jin Young Ko went wire to wire at the Cognizant Founders Cup shooting 63, 68, 69 and 66 to tie Annika Sorenstam\u2019s 14 consecutive rounds under-70 record. The first three editions of the CJ Cup were staged at the Nine Bridges Golf Club on South Korea\u2019s JeJu Island before hopping the Pacific and relocating to Nevada last year due to pandemic travel restrictions. While the Seoul headquartered holding company originally intended their golf tournament\u2019s move to the Las Vegas area to be one and done, Covid-19\u2019s staying power scuttled their best laid plans. While Korean golf fans watch the leaderboard action at the Summit Club and wait for their country\u2019s lone PGA Tour stop to return home, the title sponsor is utilizing the event as a strategic vehicle to promote the global expansion of their shelf stable food brand Bibigo. The line of mandu dumplings, ready-made meals, go-chu jang sauces and Korean BBQ marinades are now distributed across the country in stores like Costco, Harris Teeter, Kroger\nKR\n, and Walmart\nWMT\n. Twenty-one percent of Bibigo\u2019s 2020 international sales came from the U.S. last year and the company projects that figure will continue to strengthen. \u201cWe made a significant improvement in our product distribution in grocery channels which is up over 60% and Bibigo\u2019s dumpling products achieved the No. 1 market share in their product category in June of this year,\u201d Wookho Kyeong, chief marketing officer of CJ CheilJedang, says. \u201cOur vision is to make Bibigo a global brand and for every consumer on the globe to have our products in their pantry or freezer. We want to be a part of their everyday life. To do that we need global marketing tools to expose our brand to increase awareness among global consumers and the CJ Cup in that respect contributes a lot and is televised across the whole world,\u201d he adds.

To [reach this audience] basketball is the right tool and the Lakers is the perfect match,\u201d Kyeong says The brand did have a recent misfire in their U.S. expansion plans in 2019 when they opened a few locations of a build your own bibimbap bowl chain called Bibigo Kitchen in 2019 that would completely shutter in less than a year.\u00a0In retrospect Kyeong admits that the build out may have been mistimed, but he believes the fast casual concept may still have merit. \u201cMy personal point of view is we opened Bibigo restaurants too early when there was not a solid base of Bibigo awareness and product distribution. Possibly we will bring it back when we believe that our packaged food in supermarkets and club channels is able to create synergy with the restaurant business. When the time is right, we can consider it,\u201d Kyeong says.  ",
