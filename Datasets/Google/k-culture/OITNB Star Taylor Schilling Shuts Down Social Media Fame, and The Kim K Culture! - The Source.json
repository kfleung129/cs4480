    "text": "About time someone\u2019s had the guts to say it! Obviously, this generation is entirely too consumed in social media and technology, to the point that we didn\u2019t even see this one coming. Star of the hit Netflix series, Orange Is The New Black, Taylor Schilling didn\u2019t hold her tongue on the topic in the new June issue of ELLE Canada. Schilling expresses that the internet only makes you feel more alone, depending on likes and comments from others about your lifestyle is not the direction for true happiness. \u201cThere is something so sad about going online and seeing almost everyone shouting \u2018Notice me, notice me!\u2019 Which is such a human desire\u2014to be acknowledged,\u201d she says. \u201cBut me responding to that with some sort of \u2018You\u2019re noticed, you\u2019re seen\u2019 only perpetuates the loneliness. Because I\u2019m not seeing you; I\u2019m not noticing you.\u201d  Schilling, 30, believes that validation should not be dependent on social media. Does she have a point? Ladies lets rewind and think about it here \u2013 How many time\u2019s have you gone shopping and thought about how many likes you\u2019d get on Instagram with this? Be honest because that\u2019s the problem. Taylor went on in to explain that people on social media sites are not being truthful and she\u2019d rather live in the real world than in these platforms. \u201cIt has almost become a defiant thing at this point because I do not believe this celebrity Kim Kardashian culture is what I signed up for,\u201d she tells the magazine. \u201cI\u2019d rather create something honest than try to create something for a social-media account.\u201d  It\u2019s very unlikely to run into someone without a social media profile regardless of what site. She explains that it takes more courage to be real online than in real life. \u201cIt takes a lot of bravery to be authentic and honest and to take that social mask off in order to connect with another human being. So much of what makes us who we are is smoothed away online. And what truly connects us is the wrinkles, not the smoothness.\u201d Would you dare putting a photo up where everything wasn\u2019t On Fleek ? Taylor Schilling may be hitting the nail right on the head. -Tia Long (@Bytialong)  elle canadakim kardashiannetflix seriesorange is the new blacksocial mediataylor schilling Entertainment is my job, Hip Hop is my passion, and Writing is my craft. \r\nTwitter/IG -  @bytialong\r\nemail - contact.tialong@gmail.com ",
