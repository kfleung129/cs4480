One big thing that separates K-pop from just \u2018pop\u2019 is the way fans influence things and are so great. I thought an awesome way to do this would be to involve the fans.\u201d  Using Fusic (the app which lets users record themselves singing karaoke or lip-syncing to tracks), Thorne added his supporters to the visual who were singing both to his words and Yubin\u2019s raps. While his famous co-star wasn\u2019t able to make it to the actual shoot \u2014 \u201ca little bummed about that,\u201d adds Thorne \u2014 working with the Wonder Girl has long been on his bucket list. Top 10 K-Pop Girl Groups You Need to Know \u201cMy manager at the time, Johnny Wright, was actually working with Wonder Girls and said, \u2018They want to meet you,'\u201d Thorne recalls. \u201cWe ran down to Korean town and had some Korean BBQ with them; they were really great. Ever since then I\u2019ve been a big fan of K-pop and the Wonder Girls especially. I said for a couple of years, I really want to do a remix with Yubin at some point. I thought she was so great, she\u2019s so beautiful. When I did this song, \u2018The Heartbroken,\u2019 I felt like I was influenced by K-pop. I was like, \u2018This is the record to do this on.\u2019 So we called her and sure enough she was gracious enough to get on it.\u201d \u201cI knew Justin wanted to work with me and, if I had an opportunity, I was up for working with him as well,\u201d Yubin tells\u00a0Billboard\u00a0via translator. \u201cIt was really nice to see the reaction from the fans, how I came back and featured on Justin\u2019s track. I wasn\u2019t expecting\u00a0a huge reaction, but I had a lot of fun working with him and in the future if there\u2019s another\u00a0chance to work with Justin, I\u2019m more than glad to work with him\u2026It\u2019s been like two years since I\u2019ve rapped in English, but I listen to a lot of hip-hop and R&B in English and I follow the trends, so it wasn\u2019t too difficult.\u201d Wonder Girls Cover Bruno Mars Live at Billboard Studios Thorne is currently preparing his \u201cvery personal\u201d debut EP\u00a0Faces\u00a0for its April 21 release date and fans can expect a new video for his track \u201cHeartless\u201d around the same time.
