Yet, there is no mention of kindness \u2013 the act of giving without expecting anything in return \u2013 in the UN\u2019s ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. UNESCO Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Education for Peace and Sustainable Development (MGIEP) is hoping to change this through its initiative \u2018Building kinder brains\u2019 \u2013 Transforming Education with Social and Emotional Learning for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Read next: How schools can build kindness into their curriculum The MGIEP has long championed kindness as integral to emotional wellbeing and the importance of learning SEL competencies. With World Kindness Day approaching on 13th November, MGIEP director, Dr Anantha Duraiappah, says there are several important ways schools can cultivate this important quality. \u201cNeuroscience research shows that all learning occurs in a context and involves cognitive-social emotional interactions throughout the whole brain,\u201d Dr Duraiappah told The Educator. \u201cThis whole-brain activation happens when children and adolescents learn to read, count, reason, make decisions and perform acts of kindness.\u00a0 The introduction of social and emotional learning provides a double dividend to learners and society by improving academic achievements and nurturing empathetic and compassionate individuals dedicated to building a kinder world.\u201d One of the key messages of the recently launched International Science and Evidence based Education (ISEE) Assessment by UNESCO MGIEP was \u2018a whole-brain approach to learning. Dr Duraiappah said a whole-brain learner-centric approach towards learning strengthens the interconnectedness of cognition and the social-emotional domains, which is essential for human flourishing. \u201cThis approach in education integrates social-emotional learning into a highly energetic, authentically engaged process to help students learn better,\u201d she said. \u201cEducation, if implemented with an understanding of the brain, can help reinforce behaviour to create a more sustainable society by addressing problems like violence and inequality.\u201d Also critical in the early years, said Dr Duraiappah, is Social and Emotional Learning (SEL). \u201cSEL is a necessary condition for all learners to begin from early childhood, ensuring that over time, the brain can respond to changing needs such as social and emotional connections which occur in adulthood,\u201d she said. \u201cIn education, SEL practises encourages ethical choices, kindness, and calmness which build on social and emotional intelligence. Given its dynamic nature, SEL can help build social and emotional intelligence \u2013 an anchor in transforming societies towards sustainable peace.\u201d However, Dr Duraiappah said SEL on it its own is not enough. \u201cWhat is also essential for informed decision-making is critical inquiry that helps an individual validate new information, continuously questioning and relying on replicable facts to make choices,\u201d she said, \u201cAt UNESCO MGIEP, we provide a range of courses for K-12 learners, youth [18+] and teachers that have SEL, including critical inquiry, embedded in them.\u201d Police are searching for a male staff member from the school The Educator looks at the NSW Government's new plan to improve student outcomes and strengthen the teacher profession Educators hold a special place as trusted influencers, holding the potential to mould young minds and alter their behaviour, writes Geoff Flemming Copyright \u00a9 2023 KM Business Information Australia Pty Ltd ",
