Eksteins was named winner Tuesday evening in Vancouver by B.C Minister of Citizens' Services Ben Stewart. The jury\u00a0called Solar Dance\u00a0a \"fascinating work of cultural history, and a provocative analysis of the roots of the modern era as it developed in the social and political turmoil of the early 20th century.\" Solar Dance tracks the rise of Vincent van Gogh\u2019s celebrity in the 20th century as the artist, who barely sold a work in his lifetime, was embraced by Weimar Germany and later popular culture. Eksteins,\u00a0professor emeritus at University of Toronto,\u00a0analyzes van Gogh's popularity against a backdrop of social and political revolution in Nazi Germany\u00a0and the case of Otto Wacker, accused of forging van Gogh\u2019s work. Solar Dance is also nominated for the\u00a0Hilary Weston Prize for non-fiction.
