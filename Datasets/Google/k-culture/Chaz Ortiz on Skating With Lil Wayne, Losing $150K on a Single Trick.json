    "text": "By \n\n\tEric Hendrikx Chaz Ortiz was  raised in the suburbs of Chicago, and discovered his competitive circuitry early on. By the age of 11, he had followed in his father\u2019s footsteps and become a state champion wrestler. But it was skateboarding that truly engaged him, and it wouldn\u2019t be long before he had hung up his singlet and picked up a board. Needless to say, that decision paid off. In 2007, at 13 years old, Ortiz won the Gatorade Free Flow Tour. A year later, he dethroned three-time titleholder Ryan Sheckler at the Dew Tour Cup final stop in Orlando. Following a handful of successful competitions, Ortiz turned pro at 14 for Zoo York and has consistently finished among the top riders in the competitive arena since. It wasn\u2019t by chance that he was selected in 2010 to compete among the world\u2019s elite street skaters in the Street League competition series \u2013 the professional league where Ortiz remains a top competitor. Subsequent to a 2013 season-ending ankle injury, Ortiz moved to Los Angeles, taking up residence with fellow pro skater Manny Santiago and skating religiously at Paul Rodriguez\u2019s private park. But after spending time in California, Ortiz headed back home to Chicago, where he\u2019s helped bring his hometown\u2019s skateboarding culture back to life.  Of course, he still finds time for some jet-setting. Rolling Stone caught up with Ortiz fresh off a Caribbean getaway to discuss his return to the Windy City, the costliest mistake he\u2019s ever made in a competition and reading skateboarding mags in the back of Lil Wayne\u2019s Bentley. What made you decide to leave California \u2013 this hub of skateboarding \u2013 and return to Chicago?I had a great time in California, and I would never trade it for anything \u2013 but it\u2019s just not me. I grew up in Chicago and I\u2019ve been around the Chicago area my entire life. I wanted to be home, around family, and I have my own skate park where I don\u2019t have to be on anyone else\u2019s dime to go skate. It\u2019s fun skating with other pros every day. But I like to do my own thing. That\u2019s kind of how I\u2019ve always been.

I\u2019m trying to show faith and be out here and represent skating in a positive way. We just got a new amazing skate park right in the center of Chicago. And now there are all these little rippers skating and it\u2019s so cool to see. So my mission is to do stuff out here to help our scene continue to grow. When it\u2019s nice outside, I skate our local park every day. I love meeting kids and parents. Chicago can be pretty rough \u2013 I\u2019d rather see kids riding a skateboard than out making bad decisions and getting into trouble. You seem to have become an ambassador for skateboarding and for Chicago. You were recently invited to throw out the first pitch at a White Sox game\u00a0\u2013Yeah dude, and I threw a strike. It was pretty sick. I used to play baseball, and I can throw the ball, but I was really nervous about being in that situation; which is funny, because I skate in front of large crowds for a living. But yeah, it was super cool that they gave me the opportunity to do that.   Before skateboarding, you had a potential future in wrestling. Your father was a wrestler and you were a state champion. Why did you quit?I just quit because I was so much more into skating than wrestling. I would come home from tournaments and just want to skate. I\u2019d watch skate videos at the tournaments between my matches. I don\u2019t know why skating clicked in my head, but that\u2019s all I wanted to do. So I told my dad I wanted to quit and focus on skating. He was bummed, but he was also cool with letting me find my own path. He definitely supported me and drove me everywhere to skate, took me to all my contests and to everything skateboarding-related. If it wasn\u2019t for him, I just don\u2019t know. He gave me so many opportunities. I was at one of your first Street League contests in Ontario, California, when you lost to Sean Malto and basically gave away $150,000 by trying to backside crooked grind a rail when you only needed two points to win.You were there? Oh, that was the worst.That was the most expensive crooked grind I ever missed! It\u00a0was when the competition first started, and I didn\u2019t know what to do. Now, I do.\u00a0I could have done a 50-50, or maybe even a huge ollie and won. I was so confused and stressed in that moment. I was just looking around wondering what the hell was going on, and then I went for a big trick.

If I do a switch 360 flip down a double set, they\u2019d probably score me a 9 because they\u2019ve never seen me do that trick before. But if P-Rod [Paul Rodriguez] did the same trick they\u2019d give him, like, a 6.5 because they\u2019ve seen him do it. We\u2019re all different skateboarders, so that way of scoring doesn\u2019t make sense to me. That said, I do think that the 45-second runs really showcase a person\u2019s skating. If you\u2019re on point and do hard stuff in a run, that\u2019s better than just assigning a point value to a trick. But I love the contest, and it\u2019s only helping skateboarding grow. It gets more kids to skate and allows us pros to do what we love every day. You can\u2019t complain about that. This isn\u2019t a complaint, but you\u2019ve been filming a full-length Zoo York part, and you just pushed its release until next summer. What\u2019s going on with that?I\u2019m just fucking trying to make it the best that I can, you know? I have this vision for it, and it\u2019s not quite there yet. It\u2019s been a few years since I\u2019ve dropped a full-blown solo part. I\u2019m almost done. I just have a few more tricks in mind and then I can sit back and be stoked. I\u2019m stoked now, but I want to get it right.

But I love how people hate on him for skateboarding, when in actuality, he\u2019s way more passionate about skating than they are. I\u2019ve seen that fool skate. He will try a trick for hours, nonstop, until he gets it. Weezy attends a lot of skate contests, skates at The Berrics and even has his own private skate park in Miami. He\u2019s committed.It\u2019s sick. He genuinely loves skateboarding. And he knows a ton about skating and all of the riders. He\u2019s a skateboarding trivia master. I was in the back of his Bentley and he had all these skate magazines in the backseat. That\u2019s how you know he loves skating \u2013 all these skate mags in the back of his nice-ass car. He was sitting there, telling me about Ben Raybourn\u2019s most recent part. He knows his shit. He\u2019s not faking the funk. We want to hear it. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.
