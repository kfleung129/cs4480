    "text": "SAN DIEGO \u2014 No hard feelings, Shakespeare, but it sure is a pleasant change when one of those outdoor summer festivals devoted to your work offers audiences something beyond another smilingly superficial encounter with \u201cAs You Like It.\u201d There are only so many times a spectator can stroll through a prettified Forest of Arden before getting a theatrical strain of Lyme disease. It\u2019s been ages since I\u2019ve seen \u201cRosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,\u201d Tom Stoppard\u2019s metapharcical romp (to coin a genre), in which \u201cHamlet\u201d is glimpsed through the oblique perspective of the prince\u2019s twin buddies, sent to spy on him by Gertrude and Claudius in that Elsinore castle of murder, adultery and occult intrigue. And now thanks to Adrian Noble, the departing artistic director of the Old Globe\u2019s Shakespeare Festival, this madcap caper is enjoying a sprightly San Diego revival. Running in repertory with \u201cThe Merchant of Venice\u201d (also directed by Noble) and \u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream,\u201d this gamboling production dresses Shakespeare in Beckettian clothing. Not literally, mind you. The costumes designed by Deirdre Clancy for Noble\u2019s swift-footed staging have a classical bearing. But Stoppard\u2019s philosophizing playfulness is clearly indebted to the music hall absurdism of \u201cWaiting for Godot.\u201d PHOTOS: Arts and culture in pictures by The Times \u201cWhen \u2018Godot\u2019 was first done, it liberated something for anybody writing plays,\u201d Stoppard himself has acknowledged. \u201cIt redefined the minima of theatrical validity. It was as simple as that.\u201d In \u201cRosencrantz and Guildenstern,\u201d the Czech-born, English-bred playwright considers many of the same questions pondered by Hamlet: Does fate or free will define our character? What is the point of action when death, our common end, is staring us in the face? But the tone of inquiry is too bouncily meta-theatrical for tragic melancholy. The demise of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern is reported as an incidental afterthought at the conclusion of \u201cHamlet,\u201d but in Stoppard\u2019s knockabout treatment, the death of these two cheerfully opportunistic fellows is the main act. What is it like to be a character on the margins of a tumultuous drama? Apparently, there\u2019s a lot of waiting around while the protagonist talks to himself ad nauseam. CHEAT SHEET: Spring Arts Preview \u201cShouldn\u2019t we be doing something \u2014 constructive?\u201d Rosencrantz (John Lavelle) inquires of Guildenstern (Jay Whittaker), in a manner that freely invokes Beckett\u2019s \u201cGodot.\u201d \u201cI feel like a spectator \u2014 an appalling business,\u201d this mischievous rascal jokes while staring at the audience. \u201cThe only thing that makes it bearable is the irrational belief that somebody interesting will come on in a minute.\u201d Guildenstern\u2019s response sums up the metaphysical plight of being cast, like most of us muddling humans, in an ancillary role: \u201cWhat a fine persecution \u2014 to be kept intrigued without ever quite being enlightened.\u201d Stoppard\u2019s fertile wit keeps this three-act drama pulsing along without too much strain. A subtle pathos, along with the playwright\u2019s verbal sophistication, prevents the play from degenerating into a collegiate vaudeville. The situation of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern is at once a theatrical problem and an existential one. Left so often to their own devices as the royal melodrama swirls around them (trailed by a film crew in one of Noble\u2019s clever directorial liberties), these two clownish figures are filled with terrifying forebodings. PHOTOS: Best in theater for 2012 For advice on how to handle their confounding parts, they turn to the Player (a superbly hammy Sherman Howard), who as leader of the troupe that comes to entertain Hamlet and the court, clearly has a wealth of stage experience to call up. But he merely tells them, \u201cUncertainty is the normal state. You\u2019re nobody special.\u201d The subject matter darkens considerably, but the language remains spry. At moments, it attains a comic lyricism that\u2019s as funny as it is piercing. When Rosencrantz cries out in exasperation, \u201cIncidents! All we get is incidents! Dear God, is it too much to expect a little sustained action?!\u201d, one laughs but with a haunting recognition. Lavelle draws out Rosencrantz\u2019s affectionate naivet\u00e9. He\u2019s softer and more happily bumbling than Whittaker\u2019s Guildenstern, who\u2019s leaner, angrier and more aware of starker realities. The two actors might not have the most natural rapport \u2014 ideally, the play would star Jim Carrey and his clone \u2014 but they bring a sharp clarity to their theatrical maneuvers. They also outshine, as they\u2019re supposed to, those cast in the roles of Hamlet (Lucas Hall), Polonius (Charles Janasz), Gertrude (Ryman Sneed) and Claudius (Triney Sandoval), among other principals from Shakespeare\u2019s original. In the inverted world of \u201cRosencrantz and Guildenstern,\u201d the supporting players are the superstars, no matter how anxious they might be about the sketchy nature of their parts. Barry Edelstein, the Old Globe\u2019s artistic director, is taking over the reins of the Shakespeare Festival, and as the former director of the New York Public Theater\u2019s Shakespeare Initiative, he brings a great fund of experience to the job. He\u2019s sure to vary the menu, as Noble has done during his four-year tenure. Expect to see not only more work from Shakespeare\u2019s contemporaries but also modern classics with an unexpected Shakespearean scope. charles.mcnulty@latimes.com twitter.com\\charlesmcnulty \u2018Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\u2019 Where: The Old Globe, 1363 Old Globe Way, Balboa Park, San Diego When: Contact theater for schedule.
