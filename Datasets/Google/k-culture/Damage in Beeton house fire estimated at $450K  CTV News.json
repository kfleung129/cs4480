(Courtesy: New Tecumseth Fire) A fire at a home in Beeton Sunday is still under investigation, but firefighters say damage is estimated at about $450,000. Crews responded to the fire early Sunday morning, just after 4:30 a.m. when a neighbour noticed the fire at the home on Coburn Crescent. Crews started an aggressive attack on the fire, which was showing through the roof. Firefighters had to pull back, however, when the roof collapsed. Crews were able to contain the fire but there is significant damage to the top and main floors. The investigation into the cause is being made difficult because the collapse of the roof and floor has made the house unsafe to enter. Nobody was home at the time of the fire and crews were able to save the family pet. An investigation is ongoing to determine the cause but Heydon says there is nothing suspicious about the fire. *Will not be shown on the website We welcome your comments.
