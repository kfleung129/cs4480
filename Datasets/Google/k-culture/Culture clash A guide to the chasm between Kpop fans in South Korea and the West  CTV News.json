(Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP) TORONTO \u2013 After fans of K-pop superstars Monsta X launched a global protest over member Wonho\u2019s departure from the group amid allegations of a \u201cscandal,\u201d the spotlight is on the strict behavioural and cultural standards to which South Korean entertainers are held. To an international audience and fans, the allegations about Wonho\u2019s past behaviour, including allegedly using cannabis in 2013 and owing an ex-roommate money, would be laughable if they were levelled at a Western artist. In South Korea, however, any damage to a star\u2019s hard-won reputation and image are taken extremely seriously. \u201cMonsta X were widely seen as the next big K-pop group to potentially achieve popularity outside of Asia\u2026 the group has a very big North American following and their fans are devoted to the group in its current configuration. So it makes sense that these fans are upset,\u201d said Assistant Professor of Popular Culture in the Department of East Asian Studies of the University of Toronto Michelle Cho, in an email to CTVNews.ca. Wonho is not the first incident of a K-pop performer, or \u201cidol\u201d as they\u2019re known in South Korea, to have their career suffer as a result of a so-called \u201cscandal.\u201d B.I., real name Kim Han Bin, was the leader and rapper of K-pop group iKON before bowing out of the popular group and terminating his contract with YG Entertainment earlier this year, after allegedly attempting to buy -- but never using -- cannabis and LSD in 2016. B.I. later recanted his original story and admitted to some cannabis use, according to local reports. The investigation continues. Veteran K-pop performer Hyuna and her bandmate E\u2019Dawn were both terminated from their contracts with CUBE Entertainment in 2018, after they revealed their relationship \u2013 sparking international waves of anger and condemnation of the company. Many South Korean entertainment companies employ \u201cdating bans\u201d in their performers\u2019 contracts. Cho said that the cultural differences between South Korean fans and international audiences are part of the reason that fans clash over such supposed \u201cscandals.\u201d \u201cK-pop idols are a type of public figure in South Korea that really doesn\u2019t have an analogue in North America or Western Europe,\u201d Cho said. \u201cYoung idol celebrities are understood to have a duty to the public to maintain high standards of morality and character \u2014 this is because, in general, pop culture, as a collective/mainstream culture, is supposed to have an edifying impact on society.\u201d Cho said that the practice is likely a historical cultural norm that\u2019s been carried over, likely dating back to the late 1950s through the late 1980s, when South Korea was under authoritarian rule. \u201cDuring these decades, media and pop culture were tightly controlled by the state, and all forms of public culture were supposed to advance the public good,\u201d she said. International fans frustrated by what they perceive as unfair or unduly harsh treatment of their favourite stars in South Korea, however, end up \u201cdirecting their frustration towards what they perceive as a broader set of problems in Korean society and the entertainment industry at large,\u201d said Cho. The culture clash between fans is nothing new, but as K-pop continues to generate curiousity and gain immense popularity abroad, the scrutiny on how performers are treated by their management and South Korean audience will likely increase. \u201cIf you look at how the coverage of Korean celebrity culture has developed in the last decade, there is a huge spike of coverage after 2017\u2026and many outlets are now covering K-pop on a regular basis,\u201d Cho said, adding that social media plays a major part in making Kpop stories go \u201cviral,\u201d whether positive or negative. But the media attention, social media presence and constant availability of K-pop acts to their fans comes at a cost. \u201cThe K-pop industry cultivates strong fan engagement through a variety of industry practices \u2014 fan meetings, weekly music shows, fan chat rooms, social media accounts, etc.,\u201d Cho said. \u201cDevoted fans feel some ownership over the idols\u2019 images, since the industry encourages this sort of attitude \u2014 idols cultivate fans\u2019 fantasies that they are in a direct, human relationship with the idols,\u201d she said. Cho said most fans realize their relationship with and \u201cownership\u201d of the idol and their image is indeed fantasy, but there are those who \u201care not able to distinguish between their fantasy relationship and an actual one \u2013 thus they feel personally offended and \u2018betrayed\u2019 when their idols do things that they don\u2019t identify with or approve of,\u201d she said. That\u2019s where fans collide. For Western audiences, getting tattoos, going on dates, smoking a cigarette or even cannabis use may not be considered anything out the ordinary for a performer -- but in conservative South Korean entertainment culture -- especially for idols, they are considered taboo and in the case of cannabis, illegal. Although Cho said she understands the motives and mindset of international fans upset by a \u201cscandal\u201d that would barely be a blip on the radar of a Western artist, she cautions that generalizations about South Korean culture and social norms may be \u201coverblown.\u201d \u201cMany K-pop fans outside of Korea [only] see Korean society as filtered through the lens of K-pop,\u201d Cho said. \u201cThe industry is much less representative of Korean society at large than it can appear to be if one\u2019s main access to Korea/Korean culture is K-pop fandom.\u201d Advertisement Use of this Website assumes acceptance of Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy | Accessibility \u00a9 2023All rights reserved.
