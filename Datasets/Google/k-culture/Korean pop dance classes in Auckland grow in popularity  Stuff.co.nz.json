Crave\u00a0NZ is made up of Cindy Lu, Rachel\u00a0Matela, Vivian Xu and Vee Xu. Their group name is a combination of their individual names.

K-pop and K-pop dancing was different to other types of music and dance due to its theme and aesthetic, Xu said. \"It's very detailed and it's almost a sensory overload but it's captivating,\" Xu said. With a demand for classes based on songs by girl groups, Crave\u00a0NZ said they were happy with the turn out. They taught their first class to the song\u00a0Red Flavor by\u00a0South Korean girl group Red Velvet. \"These types of classes are a way for fans to involve themselves,\" Matela said. \"It's a way of sharing love and a good way to make friends.\" University student Amanda\u00a0Middeldorp\u00a0said Crave\u00a0NZ's dance class was a good experience. \"It was beginner friendly but complicated enough to keep it interesting,\" Middeldorp said. Fellow dance teacher Mitchell Yee started teaching K-pop dance classes in 2013 after noticing there was a demand. He said it was good exercise as it involved stretching, cardio and it was also good for the mind because there was a lot to remember. \"It's very rewarding to see people come to classes and progress as dancers,\" Yee said.\u200b Founded in 2012, K-Pop Planet is a\u00a0University of Auckland social club which aims to promote Korean culture and music through events.\u00a0Last year, the club had 240 members and now it\u00a0has 330. K-Pop Planet president Jack Lin said K-pop stood out from mainstream music because it was more lively and the choreography that accompanied the songs was incredibly in sync. \"Every step has to lead onto the next which means everything flows,\" Lin said.\u200b K-Pop Planet member Chutima\u00a0Kaewkruasri\u00a0has been a fan of K-pop for 10 years\u00a0and now studies audio engineering. She liked K-pop because it was an audio-visual experience and she decided to pursue audio engineering as a way to give back to it. \"K-pop\u00a0has played a big part in my life,\"\u00a0Kaewkruasri\u00a0said. Kaewkruasri\u00a0liked K-pop because it was an audio-visual experience that was well produced both on stage and behind the scenes. Crave\u00a0NZ will hosts dance classes every Saturday.
