An online duty-free mall and mobile application have also been launched. Located in the 63 building, one of Seoul\u2019s best-known landmarks due to its shimmering golden luster offering an expansive view of the Han River and city of Seoul, the facility partially opened on December 28 2015 as previously reported. According to the retailer, sales have since increased five-fold since and significant growth is expected as the year progresses. The retailer also said Galleria Duty Free 63 provided an unmatched experience as a shopping Mecca that served as a gateway to the range of tourist sites across Yeouido, a large island in the Han River and Seoul\u2019s main business and investment banking district. In addition, the store provides the best Korea\u2019s Hallyu culture can offer, the retailer indicated. Spread across four storeys\u00a0with a total floor area of 10,153sq m, luxury boutique brands such as Ermenegildo Zegna, Philipp Plein, Michael Kors, Aigner, Coach, and Longchamp, have all opened since the soft-opening last year. The store now features more than 540 brands. Visitors are greeted by natural lighting on the ground floor, which features luxury boutiques and cosmetics brands. The first floor comprises global luxury watch and jewellery brands, while the second and third floors feature \u00a0fashion, tobacco, alcohol and general merchandise brands including Korean cosmetics labels that have become popular in Asia. Street 1O1, offering diversified fashion items by rising Korean designers, can also be found on the second floor. Another feature of Galleria Duty Free 63 is the K-Special Hall located on the third floor, where visitors can experience various products from 141 brands by Korea\u2019s leading small and mid-sized enterprises and high potential equivalents. The third floor also includes a character store for children and a hands-on IT product zone for \u201ckidults\u201d designed to cover a wide range of preferences and interest of visitors. A cultural tourist attraction with annual visitors of over 3.32 million, visitors can choose from various activities within the 63 Building after shopping at Galleria Duty Free 63. Hanwha Group has rebuilt its aquarium under the concept of \u201cReal Nature\u201d and changed its name to Aqua Planet 63. Here, visitors can enjoy underwater performances and view the exotic aquatic wildlife, 63 Art, that provides a view of the Han River and numerous works of art. The premium buffet restaurant and high-end Chinese, Japanese and French cuisine can be enjoyed with a \u201ccommanding view\u201d of the Han River.  Galleria Duty Free 63 also offers One Stop Tour courses that group together Yeouido\u2019s tourist products by theme, including shopping, tourist sites and Hallyu content. The One Stop Tours include the Hallyu Course, Traditional Korean Market Course, Culture and Art Course and Han River Course, offering half-or full-day tours that include shopping and sight-seeing. A typical tour might begin with shopping at Galleria Duty Free 63, followed by bicycle rides along the riverside park bike path, various water sports/leisure activities and a relaxing break while taking in a view of the Han River. A K-culture Zone on the fourth floor of the 63 Annex Building will also be launched this year, showcasing an exclusive visual experience of K-drama in collaboration with the Korean Broadcasting System. Also, to enhance marketing, Hanwha Galleria has signed a marketing partnership agreement (see below) with Wanda Group, China\u2019s largest retailer. Under this agreement, Hanwha Galleria will carry out a joint campaign on Chinese holidays targeting more than 120 million members of the distribution company.
