Art Even art historians have guilty pleasures. For the medievalists of the Getty, in Los Angeles, it\u2019s the television show \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Last year, they began recapping episodes on Tumblr using digitized masterpieces from the collection, which is rich in images of dragons, sword play, royal weddings, knights in armor, water gardens, and the like. This season, they\u2019ve begun upping the ante with \u201cwildcards\u201d borrowed from other museums. (Spoiler alert: the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s Giovanni di Paolo painting of the beheading of St. John the Baptist illustrates Jon Snow\u2019s execution of the impertinent Janos Slynt.) They have also compiled a reading list for series characters; for the feisty princess Arya Stark, they suggest \u201cThe Flower of Battle,\u201d published in 1410, an illustrated manual on wielding weapons. Last week, they made a short film\u201cGame of Manuscripts,\u201d which recasts the show\u2019s opening sequence as a tour of the Getty\u2019s manuscript study room. What\u2019s next\u2014a lesson in High Valyrian?_\u2014Andrea K. Scott\u00a0_ Theatre Attention, citizen fact-checkers! Notice anything funny about this sign, which hangs on the downstairs level of the Circle in the Square Theatre, next to a portrait of Eugene O\u2019Neill? If your eyebrow rose when you got to the last line, you\u2019ve got it. O\u2019Neill did not, in fact, win the Nobel Peace Prize. He won the 1936 Nobel Prize in Literature. (The Peace Prize that year went to Carlos Saavedra Lamas, who helped end the Chaco War, between Paraguay and Bolivia.) My friend and colleague Adam Feldman, a theatre critic at Time Out New York, has been waging a fussbudget\u2019s campaign against the sign since 2011, when he blogged about the error after noticing it at a performance of \u201cLombardi.\u201d This month, at a press preview of \u201cFun Home\u201d (reviewed in this week\u2019s issue), he saw the uncorrected sign again and took his cause to (https://twitter.com/FeldmanAdam/status/589103119159664640). Just in case, he sent the photo to a \u201cFun Home\u201d publicist, saying, \u201cIt would be great if they could fix this. I do a little face-palm inside my head every time I see it.\u201d Three minutes later, he got a reply from Susan Frankel, the theatre\u2019s general manager: \u201cUnbelievable we\u2019ve never seen that before!\u201d She immediately corrected the sign with white-on-black label-maker tape. Reached last week, Frankel said, \u201cAdam has an ally in me, because I am in trouble all the time here for being a real nitpicky proofreader and grammarian. I think I assumed all this time that it was true that O\u2019Neill won a Peace Prize, and that\u2019s why it was such an extraordinary fact.\u201d As for whether \u201cHughie\u201d truly counts among his masterpieces (it was produced twice by Theodore Mann, the Circle in the Square\u2019s co-founder), that remains for future patrons to judge, on their way to the restrooms.\u2014Michael Schulman Movies American teen-rock movies of the late fifties and early sixties tended to make young people look like na\u00efve idiots. It took a young-at-heart French director in his mid-thirties, Jacques Rozier, to capture, in his first feature, \u201cAdieu Philippine\u201d (which he shot in 1960), the severe drama and the earnest games contained in the exuberance\u2014nowhere more than in this thrilling, exquisite dance sequence. Michel (Jean-Claude Aimini), a young TV technician in Paris, has been drafted into the French Army; he and two teen-agers, Juliette (Stefania Sabatini) and Liliane (Yveline C\u00e9ry), head down to Corsica, where he has to catch a ship to report for duty. Along the way, the women compete for his affections. The first scene here, in a car, has no subtitles. (To skip straight to the dance, go to the 1:40 mark.) The trio is lost; Michel needs help reading the map; Juliette has her arm around him as he drives, and he uses the map as a pretext to get her off him (\u201cIt would be much easier if you held the map with two hands\u201d). That\u2019s when we reach the seaside caf\u00e9 where the great nocturnal dance takes place. Juliette is a girl of rock; her seductive wiggles leave Michel, a relatively traditional young working man, cold. The young people dance\u2014and so does the camera. Rozier, who is now eighty-eight, is the one New Wave director who went to film school, and he worked as an assistant to television directors\u2014which is to say, he had experience in stage-managing for the camera and the actors in real time (which is what Michel does in the first scene of the film). The deft and delicately timed choreography for the dancers and the camera puts Rozier\u2019s craft on display. When the tunes turn sentimental, Liliane goes it alone\u2014with a look, or a pair of looks, into the camera that are defiant, proud, intimate, complicit. As Lesley Gore later sang, it\u2019s the look of love\u2014and that look, delivered both by the actress and by Rozier\u2019s camera, was as central to the spirit of the times as was the music. Rozier\u2019s few films capture that spirit as few others do; they\u2019re not available in the U.S. on home video, which is why his work is among the most grievous gaps in American film appreciation.\u2014Richard Brody Night Life It's ironic that the English performer Tahliah Debrett Barnett is in the news because she's settling down. Better known as FKA Twigs, she\u2019s engaged to the scruffy actor Robert Pattinson, and the paparazzi have been on a hunt for an image of her engagement ring. She was raised as a dancer, and motion is core to her being. Soon she will be in New York City, taking over a massive warehouse space in Brooklyn from May 17th to 19th, for a performance during the Red Bull Music Academy Festival New York, where she and ten dancers will explore the limits of human kinetics. Her music, which seemed to arrive last year with the urgency of a scientific discovery\u2014in fits and starts and then, suddenly, everywhere at once\u2014draws on early-nineties trip-hop, and enriches it with sensual R. & B. and Kate Bush-like theatrics. In concert, she moves as she sings, giving her songs new meaning with her athletic and artistic\u00a0gestures. Her latest video (N.B., it\u2019s a wee bit N.S.F.W., for its conceptual depiction of a birth) is for her new song \u201cGlass & Patron,\u201d and it showcases her movement style. In a related interview, the surprisingly demure artist sits down and talks about everything from parenting to creativity, and reveals a telling belief about her work: \u201cIf everyone did get it, I must be doing something wrong.\u201d\u2014John Donohue Food & Drink Ice-cream season is approaching (though some would say it\u2019s been here all along), and it\u2019s time to get serious about options. After the deflating news that Jeni\u2019s Splendid Ice Creams will have to destroy two hundred and sixty-five tons of ice cream due to a listeria contamination, it\u2019s important to stay positive and trust your ice-cream purveyors. One of my favorite shops in New York has always been Cones, on Bleecker Street, run by the Argentine brothers Raul and Oscar D\u2019Aloisio, who make very fine gelato, especially dulce de leche and coffee mocha chip, and the occasional surprise flavor, like corn or yogurt. Last year, a new contender entered the cutthroat New York ice-cream game: Morgenstern\u2019s Finest Ice Cream. Nicholas Morgenstern (a co-owner of El Rey Coffee Bar and Luncheonette, reviewed by Hannah Goldfield this week) was a pastry chef before he opened a few restaurants, and his ice-cream shop is a labor of love. He doesn\u2019t use any emulsifiers or eggs (except for one: \u201cAmerican egg\u201d ice cream), and the flavors\u2014burnt honey vanilla, raw milk, salt-and-pepper pine nut, Szechuan peppercorn chocolate, and cardamom lemon jam, to name a few\u2014are extremely pure. While you\u2019re deciding what to try first, you can listen to this amazing song by the K-pop band Red Velvet, \u201cIce Cream Cake,\u201d and then you\u2019ll have two things you can\u2019t stop thinking about.\u2014Shauna Lyon By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.
