    "text": "Four young women stand together firmly in front of hundreds of trumpets as brass blares in the background. The words \u201cBLACKPINK in your area\u201d ring out as the scenery quickly shifts to one of a woman in a puffy white dress landing on top of two giant swans. She then begins rapping aggressively. This is the beginning to K-pop group BLACKPINK\u2019s new music video that sets up listeners for a powerful EP. \u201cKill This Love\u201d is K-pop girl group BLACKPINK\u2019s second EP. The group consists of four female members, Jisoo, Jennie, Ros\u00e9 and Lisa. The titular track, \u201cKill This Love,\u201d is an empowering song about moving on from a painful relationship. The track boasts strong marching band\u2013like instrumentals and offers smooth transitions from intense rapping to melodic singing. The transitions from the verses to the chorus highlight each of the members\u2019 excellent vocal abilities. The song also complements their signature choreography \u2014 a detail that is important because intricate dance numbers are a staple of K-pop music. The members\u2019 dancing is synchronized with the beats of the song, especially during the chorus. The second song on the EP is titled \u201cDon\u2019t Know What To Do.\u201d The beginning is soothing and calming, embracing the group\u2019s delicate side before suddenly jumping into an upbeat EDM chorus. The chorus is also in English, making it easier for K-pop fans from all over the world to sing along. The most impressive song on the EP is \u201cKick It.\u201d The song\u2019s chorus is addicting and explosive, setting it apart from all of the other songs, even the title track. The ending is especially powerful and implements a prominent chant that tempts listeners to sing along cheerfully. Another exciting aspect is the full-English rap performed by a group member, Lisa. The flow is extremely catchy and goes along with the beat seamlessly. \u201cHope Not\u201d highlights the members\u2019 voices as being steady and gentle. The acoustic track is serene and calm and is perfect to listen to in a relaxed setting. The ballad shows a different side to BLACKPINK as it strays away from the group\u2019s usually upbeat, pop vibe. In the past, the group only released one ballad song in its entire discography, so the addition of \u201cHope Not\u201d is rather exciting because it shows BLACKPINK\u2019s musical potential. The last song on the EP is a remix of the group\u2019s previous hit single \u201cDdu-Du Ddu-Du.\u201d This is the only track that fails to impress. The beats do not flow with the melody and putting the two elements together feels forced. Ultimately, the remix is a confusing mixture of cacophonous sounds. The EP would be perfect if not for the inclusion of this disappointing song. \u201cKill This Love\u201d is the perfect EP to sing and dance along to. It highlights the vocal abilities of the group and is a strong addition to BLACKPINK\u2019s already powerful history. Although the remix ends the album on a slightly sour note, the perfection of the rest of the EP overpowers any trace of disappointment.
