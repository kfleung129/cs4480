When Subis Dini arrived here in April of 2000, her family enrolled her in the sixth grade. Her first day at a Minneapolis middle school was her first day of school \u2014\u00a0ever. She could not read or write. She knew only a few words of English. Kids laughed at her for being unable to use her locker, which had a combination lock. She was born in Somalia, but didn\u2019t even share a language with some of her Somali classmates. She grew up in a refugee camp in Kenya, while others were born here or emigrated from Sweden, Italy or an Arabic-speaking country. Her parents were determined to help her succeed, but had never been to school themselves. They enrolled Dini in a St. Paul school that had become increasingly popular with Somali and Oromo families, Higher Ground Academy. A K-12 charter founded in 1999, Higher Ground serves a student body that is 98 percent East African and 91 percent impoverished. Still, its academic outcomes are so good that it has twice been named one of the best high schools in the country by U.S. News & World Report. Dini flourished there, graduating on time. \u201cIt took a lot of hard work and effort,\u201d she says. \u201cI did not want to go back where I was.\u201d One of the school\u2019s graduation requirements is that students be accepted into a post-secondary institution. Dini is nearly finished earning a degree in global studies from the University of Minnesota. In the interim, she works at Higher Ground as a teacher\u2019s aide, helping the next generation of newcomers scaffold up to grade level. One of her jobs is to administer the tests that allow the school to determine what a student\u2019s skills gaps are and how best to plug them. Last year, 61 percent of its 740 students, drawn from the entire metro area, tested proficient in reading and 67 percent in math. Using a methodology that juxtaposes challenges such as poverty and a high percentage of English-language learners against academic outcomes and advanced course completion rates, the magazine awarded medals to 145 Minnesota\u2019s high schools.\u00a0Higher Ground was No. 47. While the program\u2019s 62 percent on-time graduation rate lags well behind other schools on the U.S. News lists, it\u2019s proof that students who start out behind don\u2019t need to stay there. (Given an extra year or two to catch up, virtually of Higher Ground\u2019s students graduate, if not on the timeline required to count statistically.) To understand\u00a0how they do it, it helps to know something about culture \u2014 the students\u2019 and the school\u2019s. Former St. Paul City Council member Bill Wilson started Higher Ground in a moment of frustration. Tired of hearing students of color described as uninterested in learning, he determined to open an Afrocentric school. At first the school was predominantly African-American. But without the extracurricular attractions of a large high school \u2014 St. Paul Central High is a two-minute stroll down the street\u00a0\u2014\u00a0it struggled to retain students. At the same time, Higher Ground was acquiring a buzz within the growing East African community. The immigrant parents placed a premium on education, even if they had no personal exposure. Like Dini\u2019s, many of them were concerned that placement in a mainstream ESL classroom wasn\u2019t enough. Higher Ground made a deliberate decision not to acculturate the students who poured through the new pipeline. \u201cOur approach is that the students\u2019 culture is their roots,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cWe need to nourish and support those roots, but also give them experiences so they can more easily navigate the outside culture.\u201d Besides, the vision he and\u00a0founding Principal Samuel Yigzaw\u00a0started with was that by expecting children to conform to a single set of cultural norms, schools fail a lot of communities. \u201cWe start with the premise that if a change needs to be made, it\u2019s with us,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cWe make a good faith effort to educate whoever shows up.\u201d As required by law, the school is nonsectarian and there is no religious instruction. But its leaders have made every effort to understand students\u2019 home cultures \u2014 far from homogenous despite the lumped-together labels \u2014 and have recruited a multilingual staff. One early challenge: Administrators were initially stumped by parental complaints about student participation in art classes. They asked and listened and learned that Muslim children are taught not to try to replicate any part of the body. After more conversations, art programming that respects this belief was created. Similarly, the use of people\u2019s photographs is discouraged unless necessary for a practical purpose, such as obtaining an ID or a driver\u2019s license. Dini asked not to be photographed for this story, and the school asked MinnPost not to use images of students. When students enroll, an assessment is done. \u201cThe first thing we do is give them a writing assessment,\u201d said Yigzaw. \u201cWithout knowing that, I really can\u2019t teach them effectively.\u201d An individual learning plan is then created that involves a school year that\u2019s 220 hours longer than most. If a student is behind, he or she gets intensive services paid for by federal Title 1 funds. Students are continually assessed on the fly, and staff compare notes weekly to identify small gaps before they become big ones. \u201cIf students are not making adequate progress we need to know,\u201d said Wilson. Students are grouped by their achievement level and transferred into more challenging classes. Advanced Placement courses are available, as is support for a student who can meet the level of rigor with the right assistance. Students are encouraged to take off-campus college-level classes through the state\u2019s\u00a0Post Secondary Enrollment Options\u00a0(PSEO) programs. Indeed, many students graduate not just with a college acceptance letter on file but with credits to transfer obtained free of charge. Teachers work on annual contracts and are evaluated at least four times throughout the year. \u201cWe don\u2019t have teachers running out the door,\u201d said Yigzaw. \u201cWe have teachers wanting to stay.\u201d Teacher preparation programs are anxious to expose their students to the mix of strategies and the high-expectations mindset. Student teachers come from the universities of St. Thomas, Hamline and Concordia (which is also the school\u2019s charter authorizer). Higher Ground has a particularly strong bond with St. Mary\u2019s University, which boasts a culturally responsive teaching curriculum and where Yizgaw teaches. All of the institution\u2019s teacher candidates are required to student-teach at Higher Ground. \u201cAn emphasis on getting kids ready for school is important,\u201d said Joe Nathan, executive director of the Center for School Change, which partners with and shares space with the program. \u201cBut we also need to talk about getting schools ready to teach kids.\u201d Finally, school leaders work hard to nurture relationships with families and with community leaders and elders. Parents are surveyed about their experiences; last spring 100 percent responded that they were satisfied. \u201cThe parents that we deal with did not go to school in America,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cYet they hold education in high esteem.\u201d According to Dini, the fates of her classmates bear this out. One is planning to attend medical school, but several have come back to work at Higher Ground. One is helping to launch a science, technology, engineering and math program while another teaches math. As for Dini, she\u2019s happy enough helping new arrivals find their stride for right now. But she dreams of returning to a peaceful Somalia to help reconstruct. \u201cI think about trying to create a non-governmental organization (NGO),\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a lot of people still living in refugee camps.\u201d Maybe, just maybe, her aid effort will involve education.
