SEOUL \u2014\u00a0K-pop, K-dramas, K-beauty, K-fashion and other \u201cK\u201d factors that make up the \u201cK-wave\u201d have built up such a following that South Korean celebrities such as K-pop singer G-Dragon or actress Jun Ji-hyun arguably have more global recognition than current South Korea President Moon Jae-in. South Korean cultural exports are popular around the world because they are well-packaged and marketed; the K-wave\u2019s strength lies in its ability to appeal to a variety of different cultures, even in spite of the notorious insularity of South Korean culture and language. \u201cIt\u2019s called K-pop, but it isn\u2019t super Korean,\u201d said Michael Hurt, a pop culture expert and visual sociology professor of foreign studies at Hankuk University. \u201cIt isn\u2019t traditional hanbok-wearing people dancing, eating bibimbap. You see they\u2019re Asian, but you don\u2019t mark them as [South] Korean.\u2026The power isn\u2019t in the Korean-ness of it, but in that it\u2019s a kind of cultural technology.\u201d Related Articles\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tBeauty Features\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\tFounderSix Raises $12 Million in Funding\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tFashion Scoops\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\tGwyneth Paltrow to Pick Up Honor for Goop at CFDA Fashion Awards International brands have taken notice, and many of them are harnessing the star power and marketing prowess behind the K-wave to bring products, collections and specific messages to new audiences in Asia. Earlier this year, Tod\u2019s tapped K-pop star Krystal from f(x) as the Italian luxury brand\u2019s first-ever Asian model in its latest regional campaign; Luhan, a former member of EXO, has been fronting Asia-wide ads for French beauty brand L\u2019Occitane since June, and Fendi backed the launch of a new capsule collection with Taeyang from boy band Big Bang in late August. \u201cSomeone like Taeyang\u00a0\u2014 why would Fendi choose to do a collaboration with him versus someone like Rihanna or a more Western star? [Just look] at his Instagram data, which is fascinating,\u201d said Kim Leitzes, chief executive officer and founder of Parklu, a digital platform that connects brands with Chinese influencers. \u201cHe has 7.6 million followers on Instagram; 90 percent of his followers are under the age of 35\u2026.You can only imagine what these numbers would look like if Instagram wasn\u2019t blocked in China. \u201cIn his case he doesn\u2019t look like the classic Fendi customer and they\u2019re looking to attract the younger Asian demographic.\u2026The average luxury consumer in North America and Europe is 40 to 60 years old. In China [and other parts of Asia] they\u2019re in their 30s,\u201d she added. Some brands, like H&M, have taken it a step further by launching their own Korean street-style collections. In 2016, H&M\u2019s \u201cK-fashion\u201d limited-edition capsule collection sold exclusively in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan was well-received by K-pop and K-fashion fans in the region.  Since the 1800s, the Korean peninsula has been described as a \u201chermit kingdom,\u201d an isolationist territory with its own unique culture, social customs and norms. But while the term is still sometimes used to describe North Korea\u2019s Communist dictatorship, South Korea, which only became a democracy in the late Nineties and which remains one of the most ethnically and culturally homogenous nations in the world, has managed to become a remarkably influential pop culture purveyor and trendsetter over the last 10 years. Nowadays, glossy, well-produced music videos featuring the choreographed moves of K-pop stars and picture-perfect soap operas, as famed for their melodramatic storylines as the Gucci dresses and Jimmy Choos worn by the immaculately styled\u00a0heroines in them, are the new symbols of modern South Korea. South Korean pop culture has become hugely popular in part due to the fast-paced rate of digitalization\u00a0\u2014 social media, mobile phone culture \u2014 and globalization in recent years, but it is not an isolated phenomenon in East Asian culture. Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea have each respectively experienced what economists once called an \u201cEast Asian renaissance\u201d over the past 30 years. The K-wave shares much in common with older movements such as the golden era of Hong Kong cinema between the Eighties and Nineties, during which Cantopop music also reigned and Triad and gangster-influenced fashion and films represented the dominant regional counterculture at the time. There also was\u00a0the popular and influential J-rock \u2014 Japanese rock \u2014 scene led by \u201cvisual kei\u201d bands such as the flamboyantly dressed and elaborately coiffed Glay and L\u2019Arc-en-Ciel in the late Nineties and Aughts. Experts say millenias of shared histories, along with culturally similar values and tastes, have enabled the region\u2019s nations to engage in powerful pop culture exchanges. \u201cIf we look at China, [South] Korea, Japan, we have philosophies like Confucianism. The lifestyle is a bit similar, the value system is a bit similar; people are not too extroverted, they\u2019re more introverted; they have shared phenotypes and look alike. They have the same appreciation for what is beautiful, whereas compared to the U.S., it\u2019s very out there,\u201d said Bettina Ding, a consultant at Cherry Blossoms, a marketing research firm in Hong Kong. \u201cI think the Chinese in particular would prefer a more digested version of U.S. pop culture, which is what we see in [South] Korea and Japan.\u201d  Over the past decade, South Korea has remained the dominant cultural influencer in East Asia, despite the longstanding nuclear threat from the North looming over the peninsula; ongoing territorial disputes with Japan over Dokdo or Takeshima Island, and even during political tension over China\u2019s strict stance against South Korea\u2019s Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-ballistic missile system \u2014 which has led to a nationwide ban on South Korean entertainment imports and tourism. \u201cSome countries don\u2019t like other countries \u2014 and if a trend is popular in one country they don\u2019t want it in [their] country,\u201d said Simon Collins, founder of the Fashion Culture Design conference and visiting mentor to Seoul Fashion Week, recalling his experience as creative director at Nike Asia, where he oversaw regional collaborations with brands like Comme des Gar\u00e7ons and Issey Miyake. \u201cThat was mostly in the past, but for the time being to some extent it\u2019s still there.\u201d China\u2019s ban in particular stands to have a major effect on the South Korean tourism and entertainment industries; it hasn\u2019t seem to have curbed the overall demand for Korean pop culture on the continent.

And [South] Korea has defined a very appealing way of linking fashion, music, makeup to [consumers\u2019 identities].\u201d Forward-thinking international brands, like Hong Kong-based K-fashion retailer H:Connect, are increasingly channeling these new attitudes and identities.  H:Connect, which first launched in 2013, is best known for ad campaigns featuring South Korean celebrities in a variety of preppy blouses, cartoon T-shirts, skinny jeans and other clean-cut street-style-inspired basics. \u201cThe K-pop trend had been permeating Asia all the way from Korea to Southeast Asia,\u201d said Brian Lee, manager of Branded Lifestyle, parent company of H:Connect and a division of Fung Retailing Group. \u201cI knew that we had to take part in this cultural movement. So with K-pop culture as anchor, we launched our brand. It turns out when you have the right brand positioning and the flexibility in store format you can grow a brand very quickly. \u201cFrom a brand perspective, consumers are very clear on what they like. If something is good, consumers don\u2019t really care about what country it\u2019s from,\u201d Lee continued. \u201cAfter all, Asia is a group of pretty tight countries when it comes to entertainment and fashion culture.\u201d The brand has worked with South Korean celebrities including Yoona Lim from K-pop group Girls Generation, who often draws tens of thousands of fans during in-store meet and greets throughout Asia. \u201cI think for Asian fans, especially in high growth countries such as China and Vietnam where people are motivated to improve their lives, these idols represent dream and hope,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThey represent a potential version of a better \u2018me\u2019.\u201d \u201cThe South Korean entertainment system [tends to] incubate young idols to become pan-Asian idols, they\u2019re very good at that,\u201d Ding said. \u201cThey have strong personalities, which allows brands to choose a particular person with a particular character so it communicates to a particular market.\u201d For this reason, more relatable multicultural K-pop celebrities with crossover appeal such as Kris Wu and Luhan, who are respectively Chinese-American and Chinese former members of wildly popular boy band EXO, are especially bankable for the brands they front.  \u201cFor example, Kris Wu\u2019s bad boy image appeals to a particular market,\u201d Ding said. Wu, who collaborated with Burberry to curate pieces for his own Burberry ad campaign in 2016, is credited with bringing a fresh street-style sensibility to the British brand, as well as boosting its sales in China. With his K-pop aesthetic, and multilingual abilities, Wu speaks English, Korean, Cantonese and Mandarin and embodies a new generation of K-wave entertainers going global. \u201cI think whenever a person, whether it\u2019s a celebrity or KOL, when they can speak the language or connect with people \u2014 that is their currency in social media,\u201d\u00a0Leitzes said. \u201cWhen an influencer can speak to that it adds a whole other layer. Multicultural identities are helpful in this world.\u201d The growing importance of the role of multicultural ambassadors is undeniable, as KOLs vie for pan-Asian \u2014 if not global \u2014 appeal. \u201cSome of the South Korean celebrities I have worked with can spend up to an hour to rehearse a phrase in Mandarin,\u201d Lee said. \u201cJust so that when she says it in front of fans, she would sound more native.\u201d Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.
