The ACC consists of the ACC Creation, where artists can develop their ideas and stories; the ACC Archive & Research, where journals and published materials from around Asia are stored; ACC Children, where children can learn and take part in cultural programs; ACC Theatre, where artists can exhibit their work; and ACC Culture Exchange, where people can learn and view exhibitions about the May 18, 1980, Gwangju Democratic Uprising.\u201cThe ACC will be a \u2018test bed\u2019 where both local and international artists can develop their ideas and experiment, creating works of art not only in Gwangju but also abroad,\u201d said Bang Sun-gyu, acting president of the ACC, in an interview with The Korea Herald at his office in the culture complex, last Wednesday.\u201cThe ACC is different from other exhibition halls. This is not a place where it just collects arts and shows to the public like others. We want to create an ecosystem focused on enabling artists to create original stories, or recreate or reinterpret traditional arts with modern technologies.\u201d  The Korea Herald by Herald CorporationCopyright Herald Corporation.
