K-pop is not just GOT7; we\u2019re all family. GOT7, another group, different companies \u2014 we\u2019ll start right now and later we\u2019ll make K-pop bigger so another group can perform here too.\u201d GOT7 leader JB added to that sentiment, saying that they feel \u201cblessed\u201d to be able to share the culture of K-pop.
