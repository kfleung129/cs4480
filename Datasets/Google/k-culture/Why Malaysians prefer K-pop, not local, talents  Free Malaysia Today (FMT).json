PETALING JAYA: The death of K-pop star Kim Jong-hyun that triggered a public tribute in Kuala Lumpur has raised questions over why Malaysian youths are drawn to the K-pop culture more than local talents. Some have named this a \u201cphenomenon\u201d as the K-pop culture influence seems to be growing in Malaysia, especially among youths. There are local-based fan clubs and youths who have picked up the Korean language just to communicate with K-pop stars during fan-meets. Some even fly to South Korea to attend concerts there. The question remains as to why these youths are more attracted to artistes abroad than locally-bred talents. Speaking to FMT, an avid K-pop follower and former entertainment writer, Faie Kimi, 34, said there was too much unnecessary gossip circulated about local artistes. \u201cI\u2019m not saying they are perfect, but there isn\u2019t so much scandal and gossip surrounding Korean artistes. Overall, they portray a positive image. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many unique characters in the local music scene. It\u2019s not that Malaysian youths are not interested, but there is a lack of local talents who are on par with international artistes,\u201d she said. Another reason Faie gave was that K-pop artistes\u2019 fan servicing was one of the best compared with local artistes. \u201cThat is one reason why many are attracted and are loyal fans. The artistes appreciate their fans and they make the effort to organise fan-meets. \u201cFor me, I was attracted to the K-pop culture because of the positive vibes they portray and the constant cheerful tone they set. \u201cThis got me interested to learn a new language. It even got me interested in their economic growth, how they excel in work and how they were once far behind Malaysia and today they are one of the leading countries in technology,\u201d she said. In addition, Faie said there was also a narrow mindset among Malaysians. Hence the controversial comments over the recent vigil held by scores of fans in KL for the late K-pop star Jong-hyun who was believed to have committed suicide due to depression although he was at the height of popularity. \u201cIn Malaysia, nothing is allowed (semua tak boleh). It isn\u2019t surprising that youths have shifted their attention to the artistic scene of other countries,\u201d said Faie. Namewee has to show his talents abroad Faie\u2019s explanation perhaps provides an insight into a lack of support for local talents, with the home ministry recently even \u201crejecting\u201d popular local singer Namewee. Namewee, who is embarking on his \u201c4896 world tour\u201d concert series, had recently uploaded a video clip expressing his discontent over his concert application being turned down by the home ministry. In the video, Namewee said he and his concert organisers had recently applied directly to the ministry for permission to hold the concert. However, he claimed, ministry officials told him \u201cnot to submit\u201d the application. \u201cThey didn\u2019t reject me directly. Instead, they asked me not to submit my application, because according to them, if I had submitted my application and they had to reject it, it would be awkward. \u201cThey told me that something \u2018big\u2019 will be happening between February and April, so it would be inconvenient to have any concerts held then. \u201cSo they said it would be better if we don\u2019t submit the forms,\u201d said Namewee. The numbers \u201c4896\u201d, when pronounced consecutively, represent a homonym for a colloquial Hokkien phrase which means \u201cvery strong\u201d. However, he said, it was really weird when he did checks online and found that K-pop stars, Jay Chou (Taiwanese singer) and also Jacky Cheung (Hong Kong artiste) would be here in January and February \u201cI don\u2019t understand why they didn\u2019t allow me to submit my application. So, in conclusion, my concert will be nowhere in sight here in Malaysia. \u201cI am really disappointed as I really wanted to come back and meet all my friends. \u201cSo for those of you who want to support my show, you can catch me at my second stop in Singapore (Feb 3, 2018). \u201cI will be holding the concerts in other countries but they are very far away from Malaysia, so Singapore is the nearest,\u201d he said. Namewee said his concert in Taipei had been well received. He added that he did not mind if Malaysians wanted to wait until the application was approved, but he expressed uncertainty about the approval for his concert in Malaysia. \u201cI don\u2019t mind if Malaysians want to wait but I really don\u2019t know when it will be held and we were unable to submit the forms. \u201cI have been away for the past two years working hard to promote Malaysia. \u201cI hope the Malaysian government has taken note of what I have done. Please don\u2019t judge me with preconceived ideas. Please stop putting labels on me unnecessarily. \u201cI think everyone should have their freedom of speech and their moments when they express themselves. \u201cI hope the government will approve my concert. At least they haven\u2019t rejected me. There is kindness to be found everywhere,\u201d he said. Namewee, whose real name is Wee Meng Chee, is a 34-year-old Muar-born singer-songwriter-rapper and filmmaker. He shot to fame in 2007 after releasing a controversial song titled Negarakuku, a remake of the national anthem of Malaysia. Namewee is known for his music videos that are commentaries on Malaysian current affairs. He was previously arrested over the sensitivity of his song lyrics but was not charged. In recent years, he has been making movies, including his first release, Nasi Lemak 2.0. He was invited to collaborate with notable Taiwanese pop-stars such as Leehom and G.E.M. The unsuccessful application for his 4896 concert tour will not be his first experience of \u201crejection\u201d as his 2013 movie Banglasia was banned in Malaysia. The film premiere had to be moved to Singapore. Namewee may not be categorised as a mainstream artiste, but it is local talents like him who have created a sub-culture among youths. Unfortunately, this seems to be the \u201cfate\u201d of budding talents. Indirectly, such negative vibes appear to be deterring youths from \u201cinvesting\u201d their time and interest on local talents.
