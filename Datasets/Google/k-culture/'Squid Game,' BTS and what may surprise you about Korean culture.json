Today, it\u2019s not uncommon to see Korean content and stars grabbing headlines in Western media, whether it\u2019s \u201cSquid Game\u201d being greenlit for a second season or K-pop superstars BTS releasing their latest album \u201cProof\u201d to commemorate the group\u2019s ninth anniversary. But with global demand for Korean pop culture at an all-time high, it feels like South Korea is kind of losing control over its cultural narrative. This dichotomy between \u201cK-culture\u201d and \u201cKorean culture\u201d is probably being further reinforced by mainstream English-language news outlets Just a decade ago, I was fruitlessly seeking opportunities to write about K-pop; today, I\u2019m frequently turning down requests from various editors and publicists asking me to write an article about a new K-pop idol group \u2014 that is, photogenic boy or girl bands that perform the kind of dance music that many of us have now come to associate with K-pop. I never thought I\u2019d see the day when I\u2019d actually get tired of people asking me to write about the topic, but it seems that just when much of the Korean public and the Korean diaspora have moved on from K-pop due to the surfeit of idol groups (about 200 to 400 of them have debuted in the past decade, and over 50 are debuting in this year alone), the rest of the world is clamoring for it. As I\u2019ve written before, the type of Korean cultural content that\u2019s popular in South Korea \u2014 whether that\u2019s music, films or TV shows \u2014 often tends to be very different from the kind that\u2019s popular abroad.\u00a0Until \u201cParasite\u201d came along, Korean films that were a hit with many international audiences were box-office flops in South Korea, and vice versa. K-pop is probably the best example of this puzzling paradox. \u201cIt seems like anytime someone writes something about K-Pop \u2014 particularly pieces on boy and girl bands \u2014 it doesn\u2019t really matter who authored the articles, it\u2019s pretty much a guaranteed way to generate massive clicks,\u201d Bernie Cho, a music industry veteran and president and founder of DFSB Kollective, an agency that works with hundreds of independent Korean music acts, explained to me. \u201cBut unfortunately, what sort of happens as a result of this type of clickbait journalism is that you get a very skewed and myopic lens on the Korean music industry landscape. If you only believed what you read online, it would be easy to assume that every Korean music artist was a boy band or girl band.\u201d Cho noted that a 2020 Korea Creative Content Agency survey of music listeners in South Korea found that ballad is the most widely enjoyed genre in the country, polling in at a whopping 76.5 percent. \u201cThe irony is that if you scan the year-end music charts in Korea, the most streamed artists are actually not boy bands or girl bands,\u201d said Cho. Case in point: Last year, K-pop solo artist IU took the top spot on Korea\u2019s streaming charts, while the two most downloaded songs in Korea both went to trot and ballad singer Lim Young-woong. And yet, because of the ever-growing global popularity of K-pop girl and boy bands \u2014 largely thanks to their vast international fan bases \u2014 it\u2019s the kind of music that gets heavily marketed outside of Korea.\u00a0 Even the way we\u2019ve come to define \u201cK-pop\u201d \u2014 as music dominated by idol groups with flashy outfits and slick choreography \u2014 has been influenced by the narratives pushed by international (especially Western) media outlets and fans. However, Cho argues that the definition of K-pop should be broader to encompass any kind of Korean music that happens to be popular in Korea. He points out that in South Korea, all Korean artists are lumped together into one consolidated \u201cK-pop\u201d chart, which includes a diverse array of genres from hip-hop to R&B to ballads and rock. He compared it to the U.S. pop charts, where artists from a wide range of genres make up the Top 10 and Top 20 spots. \u201cThey\u2019re pop artists because they\u2019re popular \u2014 it\u2019s less about the style and more about the statistics,\u201d he said. Though Cho\u2019s answer is technically correct, it seems the predominance of idol music in K-pop\u2019s global reach has impacted the way that even Koreans themselves think about K-pop. When I ask my Korean friends and acquaintances about K-pop, almost all of them now seem to equate it with idol groups, and virtually none of them listen to it (except for the few who have to because it\u2019s directly related to their jobs). In fact, most Koreans I know have told me they listen to Korean indie and folk rock, trot, ballads and/or music by non-Korean artists. The growing popularity of Korean TV shows have proven to also reveal this disconnect. Recent South Korean favorites like \u201cHometown Cha Cha Cha\u201d and \u201cTwenty Five Twenty One\u201d \u2014 both available on Netflix \u2014 also did well internationally, but in the U.S. they were nowhere near as popular as Netflix\u2019s original thrillers like \u201cSquid Game,\u201d \u201cAll of Us Are Dead\u201d and \u201cHellbound.\u201d Currently, the slice-of-life K-dramas \u201cOur Blues\u201d and \u201cMy Liberation Notes\u201d are the top two shows on Netflix in South Korea and are both sitting in Netflix\u2019s Global Top 10 list of non-English series, but neither has cracked Netflix\u2019s U.S. Top 10. To help explain the divergence in Korean pop culture preferences between South Korean and international (especially Western) audiences, I spoke to David Tizzard, a professor at Seoul Women\u2019s University who hosts the \u201cKorea Deconstructed\u201d podcast and regularly contributes to The Korea Times. He has a theory that makes a distinction between what he calls \u201cK-culture\u201d and \u201cKorean culture.\u201d \u201cK-culture \u2014 anything with a \u2018K \u2019\u2014 is primarily designed for export. It\u2019s not designed for the domestic market; it\u2019s designed with the taste of international people in mind,\u201d he said. K-pop idol groups would probably be the quintessential example of this. \u201cSquid Game,\u201d which targeted the global market from the get-go, is another great example. In contrast, content that reflects \u201cKorean culture,\u201d according to Tizzard, is designed primarily for Korean audiences. Korean historical dramas and variety shows would probably fall in this category. Many of them are hugely popular with domestic audiences, and although some (such as the historical romance \u201cThe King\u2019s Affection\u201d) do well in other countries, they\u2019re rarely expected to chart globally, since usually their primary aim is to inform and entertain Korean viewers. Moreover, this dichotomy between \u201cK-culture\u201d and \u201cKorean culture\u201d is probably being further reinforced by mainstream English-language news outlets, which tend to overemphasize certain K-pop idol acts over other kinds of Korean artists and show a predilection for covering only certain types of K-dramas. All that said, sometimes I wonder if I\u2019m the one who\u2019s selfishly and needlessly attempting to impose a narrow view of how Korean culture should be understood and interpreted. Pop culture is meant to be enjoyed and shared by everyone according to their own tastes. Perhaps that\u2019s partly why Korean pop culture in particular has taken off across the globe \u2014 its elements are so diverse that there\u2019s bound to be something for everyone. So if K-pop stans are crushing on and promoting the heck out of their favorite idols on Twitter and YouTube \u2014 so much so that media outlets are forced to pay attention \u2014 well, who am I to rain on their parade? And if Americans tend to enjoy violent K-dramas while most Koreans prefer more low key and family-friendly ones, like \u201cTwenty Five Twenty One\u201d or \u201cOur Blues,\u201d who am I to say who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong? In the end, I\u2019d still much rather see people associate my motherland with idol K-pop and gory K-dramas than with, say, a certain dictator. Maybe those of us of Korean descent, who are observing this ever-expanding Korean Wave with a mixture of pride and bewildered amusement, should just learn to let go and enjoy the ride.
