The K-Pop fandom already knows what the rest of us are still discovering \u2014 that Korean culture is having not so much a moment as a tsunami, engulfing the outside world in its pop music, cinema, TV, fashion, art. Korea is hot, hot, hot. (The South, obviously \u2014 the North, as we all know, is entirely different). A new show at the V&A \u2014 Hallyu! The Korean Wave \u2014 opens today, showcasing everything from the 2019 film Parasite, which won the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes plus 6 Oscars including Best Director for Bong Joon-ho, to the fantastical gowns of Miss Sohee, the creations of Sohee Park, a 26-year-old fashion graduate of Central St Martin\u2019s whose degree show went viral during lockdown. Designer Minju Kim is the breakout star of Netflix series Next In Fashion, and Korea\u2019s Squid Game is so far the most successful Netflix show ever, amassing 1.65 billion viewing hours in the four weeks after its release in September 2021. Meanwhile, K-Pop has taken over the world. Boyband BTS and girlband Blackpink are now the biggest selling pop bands in the world, having conquered not just Asian but global music markets. Think Stock Aitken Waterman on digital steroids, creating not just a raft of ever changing new pop idols, but an entire global social movement \u2014 for teens \u2014 to go with it.  K-Popstars, or \u2018idols\u2019 are recruited from the age of 11 years upwards, and trained like athletes in popstar factories, overseen by management companies who install them in \u2018homes\u2019 where they live and interact with fans and media, either face to face or via digital metaverse. Bands like Aespa have four human members and four avatar members, so that they are available to fans 24/7. So far, so sci-fi. And yes, due to the intense pressure under which K-Pop \u2018idols\u2019 can find themselves, there have been suicides, although this is not referenced in the exhibition, perhaps because it is sponsored by the Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports & Tourism, which wishes to project an image of exuberant positivity. This is all about Korea\u2019s soft power, and the country\u2019s pragmatic decision to fund culture as well as manufacture. In 1994, when box office takings from Jurassic Park outperformed sales of 1.5 million Hyundai cars, the government took note and began supporting the Korean film industry. This gave a new generation of film makers the chance to experiment \u2014 the result has been K-Drama, webtoons, and Oscar winners like Parasite \u2014 whose memorable bathroom is recreated in the exhibition. As is the pink jacket worn by Psy in his satirical Gangnam Style video from 2012.  The V&A is the first major global institution to showcase modern Korean culture. It\u2019s the story of an extraordinary transformation from war-ravaged backwater to a futuristic culture whose only speed is fast and faster, driven initially by the huge success of brands like Samsung, LG, Hyundai. Curator Rosalie Kim describes how Korea\u2019s vibrant and creative culture has transformed the country\u2019s image from one devastated by the Korean War to cultural boss in an era of social media and digital culture. \u201cThis phenomenon has been amplified by tech-savvy and socially conscious global fanbases, further raising the profile and relevance of hallyu around the world,\u201d she says. The fandoms, as they are called, are known to mobilise online in giant benign waves \u2013 in 2020, during Black Lives Matter protests, K-Pop fans took to Twitter in their tens of thousands to drown out racist posts; unlike traditional pop fans, whose sole concern is the pop band they idolise, K-Pop fandoms have created an online social movement, acting as translators, activists, fundraisers, archivists.  The Hallyu! show is divided into four sections, bright and loud and immersive \u2014 history, cinema and drama, music, fashion and beauty. Amid all the colour and clamour, perhaps the most fascinating photo is in the From Rubble To Smartphones history section, of a 1979 black and white shot of giant towerblocks \u2014 Gangnam, the most expensive area of Seoul. In front of these is a man ploughing a field with an ox. It is this image more than any other which captures the hyper-accelerated modernity of Korea \u2014 in 1960, 72% of its population was rural \u2014 achieved via Stakhanovite work practices. Between 1961 and 1987, exports grew an almost unbelievable 30-40% per year. The country had fallen first to Japanese colonial occupation (1910-1945), then the Cold War when the country was divided into North and South in August 1945 by the US and the USSR. This resulted in the Korean War and years of military dictatorship in the South, which ended in 1979. North and South are still officially at war today, the border one of the most militarised places on earth.  After rapid industrialisation and economic growth in the 1960s and 70s, the 1988 Seoul Summer Olympics changed Korea\u2019s image overseas for the first time, its cheery logo reminding us of the tiger on the Frosties cereal box. During the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, people out of work had time to play around with tech, which turned South Korea into one of the most digitally innovative countries in the world. Webtoons, a Korean invention, gained popularity during this time \u2014 these are cartoons read vertically by scrolling down on your screen \u2014 providing much inspiration for K-Drama, computer games, cinema and musicals. Today, Koreans work some of the longest hours in the world \u2014 the official 52 hour week set by the government is considered \u201creasonable but elusive\u201d, with shattering levels of presenteeism and workplaces demanding employees be contactable around the clock. As a result, Koreans get the least sleep and consume the most alcoholic spirits of any country in the world. Korea has a $2.5 billion sleep industry to combat not just insomnia \u2014 which is increasing by 8% a year \u2014 but frequent cases of hyperarousal (where individuals are so overstimulated they cannot blink) as 100,000 Koreans regularly consume sleeping pills in unsafe doses. Sleep cafes \u2014 where you can nip in on your lunchbreak and pay for a quick nap \u2014 are popular.  This all fits perfectly with Korean ppalli-ppalli culture, which roughly translates as quick-quick. The country has the fastest broadband on earth; restaurants serve food almost instantly; intensive language courses promise immediate results; speed dating is huge, as are speed weddings, in locations which provide a non-stop conveyor belt of one-hour ceremonies. It is quite the opposite of the Slow Movement. So what drives this quick-quick mentality that has served to transform a country of 53 million, yet left them so sleep deprived they need cafes for naps? According to the show\u2019s organisers, in the early 90s the South Korean government progressed high-speed internet infrastructure and communication technology in \u201cthe belief that the slow embrace of industrialisation in the late 19th century caused the country\u2019s colonisation.\u201d By becoming the fastest place on earth, Korea will not allow itself to be caught out again. Walking through the giant K-Pop screen avatars, or marvelling at the beauty devices \u2014 LED masks originally developed by NASA to grow plants in space are now used by individuals to rejuvenate their skin \u2014 you might wonder about where the traditional culture of Korea fits within the fibre-optic onslaught. This compressed modernity has, say the show\u2019s curators, created paradoxes within society \u2014 after 500 years of Joseon Dynastic rule (1392 \u2013 1910), traditional Confucian and shamanistic ritual now co-exists with cutting edge tech so ahead of itself as to appear almost science fiction. This is the hybrid which has shaped hallyu.
