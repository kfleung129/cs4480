North Korean leader Kim Jong Un Sunday attended the first concert in Pyongyang for over a decade by South Korean entertainers, including a K-pop girlband, the latest gesture of reconciliation before a rare inter-Korean summit. Issued on: 01/04/2018 - 15:25Modified: 01/04/2018 - 19:36 The visit, described by many as a cultural charm-offensive by the South, came as a diplomatic thaw quickens on the peninsula after months of military tensions. The 120-member group -- 11 musical acts as well as dancers, technicians and martial artists\u00a0gave one concert on Sunday with another set for Tuesday. Kim and his wife, a former singer herself, came to watch Sunday\u2019s show, making him the first leader of the North to attend a concert by South Korean performers. Kim shook hands and took photos with the Seoul stars backstage, saying inter-Korean cultural events should be held more often and suggesting another event in the South Korean capital this autumn, pool reports said. The young couple were seen clapping their hands during the two-hour event\u00a0also attended by Kim\u2019s powerful sister, Kim Yo Jong, and ceremonial head of state Kim Yong Nam. \u201cHe (Kim Jong Un) showed great interest in the songs and lyrics (of South Korean singers) during the concert,\u201d Do Jong-hwan, Seoul\u2019s culture chief and the head of the delegation, told reporters. The South\u2019s taekwondo athletes also staged a performance before an audience of 2,300 in Pyongyang on Sunday ahead of a joint display of the Korean martial art with the North\u2019s practitioners on Monday. The rapprochement was triggered by the South\u2019s Winter Olympics, to which the North\u2019s leader Kim Jong Un sent athletes, cheerleaders and his powerful sister as an envoy. A North Korean art troupe, the 140-strong Samjiyon Orchestra, staged two performances in South Korea in February to celebrate the Games. Kim followed up by agreeing to a summit with the South\u2019s President Moon Jae-in, and offering a face-to-face meet with US President Donald Trump. Kim also met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing last week during his first overseas trip. The inter-Korean summit, the third after meetings in 2000 and 2007, will be held on April 27. No date has been set for the US-North Korean summit although it is expected before the end of May. In another sign of eased tensions, an annual US-South Korean military exercise which got under way in the South Sunday will last for just one month compared to some two months normally. This year\u2019s drills feature fewer strategic weapons such as a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, Seoul\u2019s military has said. The deployment of such powerful weaponry during past drills has frequently drawn an angry response from the North. \u2018Maze of love\u2019 Sunday\u2019s concert to a packed audience at the elaborately decorated 1,500-seat East Pyongyang Grand Theatre ended with a standing ovation after a finale in which all the stars appeared on stage to sing a song about unification. One of the most closely watched acts was Red Velvet, part of the South\u2019s hugely popular K-pop phenomenon that has taken audiences in Asia and beyond by storm in recent decades. The five-member girlband\u00a0known for its signature K-pop mix of upbeat electronic music, stylish fashion and high-voltage choreography\u00a0performed two of their hits, \u201cBad Boy\u201d and \u201cRed Flavour\u201d. Joy, one of the five members, missed the trip to Pyongyang due to her TV drama shooting schedule. \u201cThe North\u2019s audience applauded to our performance much louder than we expected and even sang along to our songs... it was a big relief,\u201d band member Yeri told reporters. \u201cI told myself, \u2018let\u2019s do our best even if there\u2019s no response (from the audience)... but they showed so much reaction,\u201d added a member called Wendy. Another member, Seulgi, appeared red-eyed as she bid farewell to the audience at the end of the concert, apparently overcome with emotion. Despite the North\u2019s isolation and strict curbs on unauthorised foreign culture, enforced with prison terms, K-pop and Seoul\u2019s TV shows have become increasingly popular there thanks to flash drives smuggled across the border with China. The emcee of Sunday\u2019s concert was a popular member of K-pop girlband Girls\u2019 Generation, Seohyun, who had performed with the visiting Pyongyang singers during their Seoul concert in February. Legendary South Korean singer Cho Yong-pil, who held a solo sell-out concert in Pyongyang in 2005, was another star of the show. Kim\u2019s late father and longtime ruler, Kim Jong Il, was known to be a fan of the 68-year-old Cho. Another famous singer, Choi Jin-hee, also performed for the fourth time in the North and sang \u201cMaze of Love\u201d\u00a0a pan-peninsula hit and another of the late Kim\u2019s favourites. But not all onlookers were receptive to the K-pop offensive. During the taekwondo event, a previously raptured audience member turned stone-faced when the athletes showcased a performance combining K-pop dance and Taekwondo routines to a hit song of ultra-popular boyband BTS. The stiffened crowd refused to respond to the athletes who motioned them to clap their hands to \u201cFire\u201d\u00a0an intense electro-dance score peppered with rapid-fire rap delivered in both Korean and English.
