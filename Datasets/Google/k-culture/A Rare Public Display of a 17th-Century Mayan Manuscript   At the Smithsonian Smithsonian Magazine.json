The book includes everything from sermons to poems, and there\u2019s a dedication to Pope Urban IV. The Libro de Sermones Varios en Lengua Quiche, from 1690, is the oldest manuscript in the collection of the Smithsonian\u2019s National Anthropological Archives. It provides not only a fascinating look at the evolution of the Maya\u00a0K\u2019iche\u2019 language, but it also tells a stark tale of religious history. \u201cWhen I see a document like this it just blows me away to see the care with which the language was put on paper by so many different people,\u201d says Gabriela P\u00e9rez-B\u00e1ez, curator of linguistics in the anthropology department at the National Museum of Natural History. She says the book is written in four different languages, including K\u2019iche\u2019, Latin, Spanish and Kaqchikel. \u201cThe paper is thicker, the book smells differently, it is really amazing to see the care with which it was written,\u201d P\u00e9rez-B\u00e1ez marvels. The Libro de Sermones\u00a0is part of the Objects of Wonder exhibition now on view at the National Museum of Natural History. The book has also been digitized so that scholars can peruse the book both to answer questions about history, but also to document the changes in the K\u2019iche\u2019 language as the Spanish were taking over the Maya\u00a0empire in the 16th century. The text in the\u00a0Libro de Sermones is very similar to the K\u2019iche\u2019 language that was spoken before contact with the Spanish. The book was given to one Felipe Silva by Pablo Agurdia of Guatemala in 1907, and Silva apparently donated it to the Smithsonian Institution sometime after that, but there are no documents explaining exactly how that happened. Today, P\u00e9rez-B\u00e1ez\u00a0says the book is quite relevant and important to scholars. \u201cK\u2019iche\u2019 is a Mayan language which dates back several thousand years. It certainly precedes Spanish by hundreds of years. It is a language which is spoken in Guatemala, so Mayan languages are still in use across what is now Guatemalan Mexico and have spread as far as the Northern third of Mexico. But otherwise they are concentrated in Mesoamerica\u2014the South of Mexico and in a little bit of Central America, Guatemala and so on,\u201d P\u00e9rez-B\u00e1ez says. \u201cLanguages change naturally, but they also change when they come into contact with other languages. . . . Once contact with a Colonial language becomes very intense . . . the influence of a language like Spanish on indigenous languages is greater and greater over time.\u201d  K\u2019iche\u2019 is spoken today by more than one million people, and thousands of K\u2019iche\u2019 speakers now live in the United States, according to\u00a0Sergio Romero, a professor in the department of Spanish and Portuguese at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cLots of migrants, especially in the last two decades, are K\u2019iche\u2019 speakers. I am often called to translate on behalf of K\u2019iche\u2019 speakers who don\u2019t speak Spanish,\u201d Romero says, adding that K\u2019iche\u2019 is one of 33 different Mayan languages. \u201cThere are different dynamics to each of these 33 languages, and each of them has a lot of regional variation. So between K\u2019iche\u2019 and Ixil, another Mayan language, there is as much difference as between English and . . . Hindi.\u201d Romero says one of the reasons the\u00a0Libro de Sermones\u00a0is important, is that in the 19th century around the time of Guatemalan independence, K\u2019iche\u2019 lost its status as the official language in the region. But there are many documents including wills, land deeds and various sorts of chronicles and other texts written in K\u2019iche\u2019 from the 16th and 17th centuries. There are also pastoral texts, catechisms and confessionals used by priests to both learn the language and try to convert the K'iche.\u2019 But Romero says the K\u2019iche\u2019 resisted being converted to Catholicism, and there is evidence of that in the book, which he says is a \u201ccrucial\u201d tool in illustrating that fact. \u201cIt\u2019s the way in which the K\u2019iche\u2019 were able to cope with the Spanish invasion and the Christian invasion . . . . They didn\u2019t assimilate,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat they did was appropriate certain elements of Spanish culture to be able to adapt and defend and protect their own spaces of political and cultural sovereignty. So K\u2019iche\u2019 religion today is really a hybrid religion that has elements of Spanish origin and elements of Christian origin\u00a0and this document shows that very well. You can see how certain words were actually bent by the Spanish to be able to convey certain meanings and you can see how those certain words were interpreted in a different way by the K\u2019iche.\u2019\u201d Romero points to the word\u00a0mak,\u00a0which is used today to reference sin, as in Christian sin. But in the 15th century it meant \u2018will,\u2019\u00a0as in your will to do something. Sin, Romero says, didn\u2019t exist as a concept to the K\u2019iche\u2019 because they were not Christian. Dominican missionaries took that particular word and shifted its meaning so it could be used to convey the theological notion of sin. \u201cThe only way to resist was to adapt,\u201d Romero says, \u201cbut the adaptation was not decided upon by the Spanish.\u201d He adds that even today, the Catholic hierarchy in Guatemala still cannot accept the fact that Christian practices among the K\u2019iche\u2019 are simply different than those of non-indigenous Catholics. Romero says the K\u2019iche\u2019 religion of today is the result of this \u201cinteresting dialogue\u201d between Dominican missionaries who wanted to impose a certain brand of Catholicism and the K\u2019iche\u2019 who\u00a0just picked whatever was interesting and useful to them. The Smithsonian\u2019s P\u00e9rez-B\u00e1ez, who was raised as a Catholic in Mexico City, explains that even in an urban Spanish environment\u00a0children are taught that one must be a good person, or they will burn in hell. She is not a K\u2019iche\u2019 expert, but P\u00e9rez-B\u00e1ez thinks that the sermons in this book likely contain similar rhetoric that was used to coerce people into converting to Christianity. To her,\u00a0Libro de Sermones\u00a0is a reminder of what she calls the brutally violent mandatory conversion to Catholicism. The Spanish colonization\u00a0involved\u00a0forced labor, and the Mayas who refused to give up their original religion were often jailed and tortured for heresy. Maya artifacts were deliberately destroyed, and most of their sacred texts were burned. P\u00e9rez-B\u00e1ez says the book was likely produced by native speakers of K\u2019iche\u2019 whose original, indigenous names had already been replaced with Spanish names, who were being converted against their will. \u201cTo me, being an advocate for linguistic diversity in this respect of human rights, it\u2019s very difficult to hold a document that was an important part of the conversion to Christianity and all of the abuses. This book was representative of an era during which colonialism and the associated conversion to Christianity oppressed the indigenous population in often violent ways,\u201d P\u00e9rez-B\u00e1ez explains. She is also disturbed by the thought that native speakers of K\u2019iche\u2019 were hired, or used, in the production of a book that was being used as an instrument to force the conversion of the remainder of the K\u2019iche\u2019 population. \u201cThis is evidence of that conversion process that was very damaging to the languages, the cultures, the local knowledge, but especially the physical and emotional well-being of the people,\u201d P\u00e9rez-B\u00e1ez says. Both she and Romero think the digitization of the\u00a0Libro de Sermones\u00a0is vitally important for scholars, even though the ancient text had to be laid nearly flat page by page to get a good digital image. P\u00e9rez-B\u00e1ez says the book has gone through conservation, and is in pretty good shape for the Wonder exhibition. Allowing\u00a0access to the document to scholars around the world is critical, Romero says. It also makes for better preservation. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten to a different age in the study of colonial manuscripts of indigenous languages. \u2026 For us, having access to these manuscripts online is crucial because we need to have concordance between different text,\u201d says Romero.\u00a0He explains that sometimes a particular text doesn\u2019t have the full story. That means scholars then have to consult different documents being reviewed by other colleagues that may include the missing fragments. \u201cMany libraries are actually digitizing their manuscripts and making them available online for scholars. . . . \u00a0It allows us to work across political lines and borders. . . . \u00a0So now we can use digital copies of manuscripts to be able to work together on the same text and that makes for a much more rich and interesting dialogue.\u201d \u201cObjects of Wonder: From the Collections of the National Museum of Natural History\u201d\u00a0is on view March 10, 2017 through 2019. Funding for the digitization of the Libro de Sermones was provided by the museum's Recovering Voices Program. Get the latest on what's happening At the Smithsonian in your inbox.
