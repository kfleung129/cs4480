By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJeff Benjamin The love for PSY\u2019s \u201cGangnam Style\u201d certainly hasn\u2019t slowed with the horsey dance video currently at over 1.5 billion views on YouTube. Its follow-up gives viewers more of what they want: crazy PSY! The music video for \u201cGentleman,\u201d released Saturday morning (April 13), follows a similar style to \u201cGangnam\u201d and its much-loved antics.

But, \u201cGentleman\u201d has an added sexual twist.

He\u2019s pulling chairs out from beneath beautiful women, making little kids cry and attempting to pull off sunbathing girls\u2019 tops. That is, until popular and sexy K-pop singer Ga In shows up in a body-hugging football outfit. Now, the tables are turned on PSY who is having chairs pulled out from underneath him.  Ga In is a member of popular K-pop girl group Brown Eyed Girls who also has her own successful solo career\u2013her single \u201cBloom\u201d peaked at No. 2 on the K-Pop Hot 100 in October and latest single \u201cBrunch\u201d just debuted at No. 36 this week. She is PSY\u2019s new co-star a la HyunA (a member of girl group 4minute and solo star herself) in \u201cGangnam Style.\u201d The subtle hip-shaking choreography featured throughout \u201cGentleman\u201d is actually homage to her group\u2019s mammoth 2009 hit \u201cAbracadabra.\u201d The single helped usher in a wave of electro-pop to Korea with its slick production, vocal-distorting effects topped off with a sugary sweet catchy hook. PSY had previously teased that Koreans knew the main dance move of the video very well and \u201cAbracadabra\u201d has stood the test of time as a major hit in the ever-changing K-pop culture. See the original, racy music video below:   It was revealed that PSY had only finished filming his music video to \u201cGentleman\u201d this week. At times, the video looks a bit like a behind-the-scenes look at \u201cGangnam Style.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t make it any less entertaining. Will it break the view count for \u201cGangnam Style\u201d? Several months will need to go by prove that, but with over 50,000 attending his concert in Korea tonight and around 150,000 watching via a YouTube stream, there\u2019s definitely no lack of hype for PSY\u2019s new single.
