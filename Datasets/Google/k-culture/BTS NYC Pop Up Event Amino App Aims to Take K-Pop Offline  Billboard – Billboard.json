(Though fan-run, the events are gaining traction\u00a0and INFINITE\u2019s Sungyeol even attended a few to celebrate his birthday together with fans in August.) Along with the displayed artwork, the event will also feature stories of ARMY about how the band has influenced their lives, with the pop-up\u2019s overall\u00a0theme drawing on BTS\u2019 most recent album, Love Yourself: Her for inspiration.  Amino will also be releasing a zine \u2014\u00a0a throwback to the early fan-created magazines that were essential to the early days of fandom culture \u2014\u00a0that contains analysis and essays based on BTS written by members of the ARMY Amino community. \u201cYou\u2019re literally entering a 360 degree world of K-pop,\u201d says\u00a0Pennell. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially a miniature BTS museum.\u201d Other social media companies have also turned to offline events to rally fandoms, including Tumblr, which recently held a special meet-and-greet with K-pop group\u00a0K.A.R.D. But for this event, and in general, Amino wants to keep the focus on its users. Amino engages users in multiple ways, providing an all-encompassing platform for people with like-minded thoughts to come together and express themselves through writing, images, videos, audio files\u00a0and other sort of community-based interactions. Some of the largest communities on Amino are based around people coming together to discuss things including anime, K-pop, motorcycles, Pokemon, sports, LGBTQ+\u00a0and veganism. With hundreds of thousands of communities on the platform, choosing BTS to base their first live event around was an easy decision according to\u00a0Pennell. Along with their recently-achieved historic records on multiple\u00a0Billboard\u00a0charts, BTS\u2019 ARMY community on Amino is one of the platforms most active, with over 630,000 members. \u201cGiven everything that\u2019s going on with the group and the amount of passion and dedication their fans have, we really wanted to celebrate that,\u201d says\u00a0Pennell. \u201cBecause that kind of passion and dedication is what we really want to foster on our platform. We really thought that ARMY is the perfect embodiment of that.\u201d Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.
