    "text": "Fifty (one) years on, Eli Lee analyses the realities and unrealities behind one of the seminal science fiction writer's densest novels  Known for writing novels that distort, contradict and flat-out deny reality, Philip K Dick is a science fiction legend. Though he died when he was only 53, Dick was amazingly prolific in his relatively short lifetime, producing 44 novels and 121 short stories \u2013 a phenomenal amount by anyone\u2019s standards. He had a reputation as a drug-addled paranoiac \u2013 I\u2019ve long imagined him sitting at home in Orange County, California, the shades pulled down to stop the light coming in, typing away all dogged and intense, stopping only to top up on amphetamines. Maybe that\u2019s unfair, but the point remains that he was obsessive; the kind of man who would do whatever it took to get his writing done. And he wrote fiction not because he wanted praise for pretty sentences; he wrote it because he saw himself as a philosopher, and he found fiction the most natural way to get his ideas across. The Man in the High Castle (TMITHC) was published in 1962, only about a decade into his career, and a good five years before he started cranking out the famous stuff like Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, VALIS and UBIK. He\u2019d already published a clutch of novels in the 1950s, but TMITHC, which won the Hugo Award in 1963, was the first to show he had serious literary chops. It\u2019s an alternative history, based on the premise that the Axis powers have won World War II and divided the globe into three: most of it is Reich-ruled; the Japanese-led Pacific States of America (PSA) controls a sliver of territory in the Far East and California; and then there\u2019s an even smaller sliver of buffer zone in the Rocky Mountains. Its characters are mostly people living under Japanese rule in San Francisco, and it\u2019s from their perspective that Dick poses the question: what if the Allies hadn\u2019t won the war? TMITHC can, of course, never answer this question with any real certainty but envisions the possibilities brilliantly. The world-building is vivid, especially in the deliberately snarky touches \u2013 like Hitler being still alive in an Austrian sanatorium, crawling towards death with syphilis of the brain. Its rich complexity helps Dick, and his readers, explore the two big questions that preoccupied him his whole life \u2013 as he says in his essay \u201cHow to Build a Universe that Doesn\u2019t Fall Apart Two Days Later\u201d \u2013 \u2018What does it mean to be human?\u2019 and \u2018What is reality?\u2019 These are questions that science fiction is best poised to answer: for one thing, sci-fi is all about playing with what it means to be human (if you\u2019re not bound to the flesh, you can go on playing forever), and as for the question of what reality is, well, it has all of science (and fiction) at its disposal to answer that. One classic sci-fi convention is to keep most of an imagined universe recognizable and prosaic, twisting and tweaking just a few things to create a sharp estrangement effect. Dick believed that this sense of dislocation \u2013 this \u201cconvulsive shock in the reader\u2019s mind\u201d \u2013 was necessary if sci-fi was going to seduce us successfully; that it must create a world that is both familiar and strange, all at once. The alternative history of TMITHC is a shining example: its world and people are recognizable \u2013 even the incongruences have their roots in reality \u2013 but there\u2019s something alien lurking there. A constant shadow. So put the existential questions and the parallel universe together, and you might guess that Dick chose to write TMITHC as a dual-purpose critical allegory - to show how terribly shit things could have been, and to show how terribly shit they are. TMITHC was written at the height of the Cold War, not long after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion and JFK\u2019s Vienna Summit with Nikita Krushchev, and with any alternative history, of course, you\u2019re duty-bound to look at the writer\u2019s context. But the Nazi regime in the novel creates such a claustrophobic atmosphere that it sort of closes in on you: there\u2019s one scene where they\u2019re running through the list of successors to Bormann (Dick\u2019s choice of Reich Chancellor) and personality profiles of Goebbels, Goering, Heydrich, von Schirach and Seyss-Inquart are offered up. It\u2019s bone-chilling; the stuff of horror stories. Of course it is. And so, when you\u2019re reading it, you\u2019re not thinking about the Cold War. You\u2019re thinking about how gut wrenchingly sickening the Nazis were. (And in the novel, they\u2019ve gone onto wipe out Africa and Eastern Europe too \u2013 it\u2019s a horror fully realised.) You\u2019re plunged into it, and it\u2019s not so easy to sit back and think of metatextual references. But what this does, instead, is take us right back to that central question: what does it mean to be human? If the Nazis are on one end of the spectrum \u2013 in that one aspect of being human is having the capacity to embody evil \u2013 then other characters in the novel balance this out, and (luckily) Dick places us mostly in their shoes. There\u2019s Mr Tagomi, a high-ranking official in the Japanese Trade Mission in San Francisco, riddled with classic Dickian melancholy about the moral numbness of the world around him; Frank Fink, a Jewish jewelry craftsman, working for a firm that specializes in fake historical American artifacts (US culture having been repressed and then reappearing as kitsch paraphernalia of a lost time, fetishized by the Japanese); and Frank\u2019s estranged wife, Julianna, who\u2019s living out in the Rocky Mountain States. Dick pulls us into their personal struggles of survival, illuminating the whole by focusing on the detail. We aren\u2019t at the heart of the nastiness but on the periphery, yet the lives of the people here are still entirely circumscribed by the Fascist machine. With their plans and hopes skewered by politics and power, they\u2019re all in the deepest of shit. And what do they do? They consult the I Ching. Escaping Fascism, they pursue Taoism. Here, the novel\u2019s morality is pretty unsubtle \u2013 the one main character who doesn\u2019t use the I Ching is also the only racist among them.  This may all sound kind of tenuous, but it\u2019s not unusual for spirituality to inveigle its way into sci-fi; especially not a PKD novel. Or think of the works of Arthur C. Clarke or Roger Zelazny, or even consider Battlestar Galactica \u2013 sci-fi is obsessed with man\u2019s solitude in the universe. It cries out for explanations \u2013 which comes right back to those two questions Dick asks and, in turn asks us to ask, about humanity and reality. It might seem odd to mix spirituality with political tension and ideological oppression, but Dick is clawing at the root to find out what really matters, when all is said and done, it has its role to play. So, then, why does he create these extreme situations, these end-of-world, post-end-of-world, and what-world-are-we-talking-about-anyway scenarios? I was listening to a bunch of Dick experts (ha ha) discuss this, on the radio show Expanding Mind and given all the wars, paranoia, confusion, flipped scripts and dissolving realities, I was surprised at what they identified as the most important point of his writing: they decided it was empathy. That\u2019s what they pulled out from the (notoriously sloppy) prose, from the memory-wiping to the electric sheep: empathy. And it\u2019s true. If it\u2019s about anything, TMITHC is about that. All PKD\u2019s novels are. We\u2019re meant to empathise with ordinary people in shitty situations \u2013 because to be human is to struggle and we\u2019re all in shitty situations. What matters is to have empathy. As Dick said:\n    \u201cYou know, people think that the author wants to be immortal, to be remembered through his work. No. I want Mr. Tagomi always to be remembered. My characters are composites of what I've actually seen people do, and the only way for them to be remembered is through my books.\u201d As for the reality-baiting, it comes into TMITHC by way of the I Ching. As I said previously, one of the best things about sci-fi is the way in which it loosens the ground under your feet. There are some PKD novels where this happens constantly, where the characters aren\u2019t sure if what\u2019s real is (really) real or just a simulacra, but no such ruptures happen here. Yet, at its conclusion, the novel\u2019s reality does fall apart, and what happens is both brilliant and confusing. The main characters are all reading a novel called The Grasshopper Lies Heavy (catchy!) about the Allies winning the war. It\u2019s banned by the Reich yet available in the PSA and its enigmatic author lives in the Rocky Mountain States. Juliana goes to find him \u2013 he\u2019s the \u201cMan in the High Castle\u201d of the title. (It\u2019s hard to explain what happens now without spoiling the ending, so consider yourselves warned.) Still here? Okay. When Juliana meets the author, he says that the I Ching (at the time believed by Dick to be \u201ca superb cosmology and science,\u201d though he later refuted this) guided his hand in writing The Grasshopper Lies Heavy, dictating the plot to him via the hexagrams that appeared when he consulted it. Then, in classic PKD headfuck-style, it\u2019s revealed that what happens in The Grasshopper Lies Heavy is in fact reality, and that the world of TMITHC is the fiction. And that\u2019s it. It\u2019s an abrupt ending, and it leaves us at the wormhole between the unreal universe of the book we\u2019re reading, and the real universe of the book inside the book we\u2019re reading. (Ouch. I\u2019m not even sure if that\u2019s a wormhole.) What did Dick intend by inverting reality like this? There\u2019s something in the fact that the world of The Grasshopper Lies Heavy doesn\u2019t match our reality completely, but its fictions are more consistent with our truths, so we have to journey through the artificial in order to get back to the real. Distinguishing between manufactured pseudorealities and the truth is a Dickian theme \u2013 this is the guy, after all, who chose to live next to Disneyland because he appreciated the way its ersatz reality fucked with his head. And time as not inexorable but malleable fits in with Dick\u2019s insistence that reality is volatile; that it constantly changes, collapses and opens up into elsewheres. Sure, this is an obvious sci-fi trope, but it\u2019s not just one of those hypotheses SF writers make up to fuck with our heads. Both in quantum physics, and in all the subjective realities that collide to create consensus reality, \u2018reality\u2019 is far from static or fully knowable. Later on, Dick would choose to explain all this away with a seriously weird Gnostic vision. After a theophany in 1974, he would come to believe he was a persecuted Christian in 1st Century Rome (it\u2019s a long story, by all accounts). But at the time of THITHC, he was still searching for answers. He was saying: what if the world isn\u2019t what it appears to be? Who are we then? Fifty years down the line, they\u2019re still as good-a-questions to ask as any.
