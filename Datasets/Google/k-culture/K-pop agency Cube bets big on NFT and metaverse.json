    "text": "K-pop fans may soon have more official merchandise to spend their money on, as South Korea\u2019s entertainment industry is going all out to embrace non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and the metaverse, with big industry names planning to bet on the new technology. One of the latest K-pop talent agencies pledging to join the NFT and metaverse race is Cube Entertainment, which manages popular artists and bands including Jo Kwon, BTOB, PENTAGON, CLC and (G)I-DLE. In November, the Kosdaq-listed company teamed up with Animoca Brands to form a joint venture dedicated to building a music metaverse and issuing NFTs. In an interview with Forkast.News, Ahn Woo-Hyung, CEO of Cube, said the sky\u2019s the limit when it comes to investing in the new technology. Cube Entertainment, which manages popular K-pop artists and bands including Jo Kwon, BTOB, PENTAGON, CLC and (G)I-DLE, is betting big on NFTs and the metaverse.CUBE's CEO says there\u2019s \"no upper limit\" to how much it will invest in NFTs and a metaverse for concerts pic.twitter.com/03rff0rd8m \u201cWe don\u2019t really have an upper limit on investment,\u201d Ahn said. \u201cThere\u2019s really no upper limit on Cube investment because we have that sense of purpose that Cube artists and members should play a role in creating new experience and new value in this field.\u201d Ahn added the company has formed a special team since last year to study NFTs and subsequently the metaverse, and is \u201ccontinuing to put a lot of thoughts into it.\u201d Ahn said he couldn\u2019t share too many details about upcoming projects, \u201cbut what I can tell you is that music will be at the core, and the artists\u2019 portraits and videos will be utilized in new and creative attempts that are fun and creative.\u201d \u201cThis could be a very important momentum not only for our company but also for the entire entertainment industry,\u201d Ahn said.

Back in July, JYP \u2014 a top K-pop entertainment agency that manages popular idol acts including girl group TWICE and boy band 2PM \u2014 partnered with Dunamu, a blockchain company that operates crypto exchange Upbit, to build an NFT platform using JYP\u2019s content. HYBE, the label behind global boy-band sensation BTS, is also actively investing in the field. Last month, it announced that it has joined hands with Dunamu to digitize BTS goods into NFTs and explore possibilities of allowing fans to collect and exchange NFTs on the company\u2019s fan community app Weverse. In an online video briefing released in November, HYBE founder Bang Si-Hyuk said the two plan to develop an NFT business under a new joint venture, which will \u201callow the artist [intellectual property-based] content and products that Hybe has showcased to date to become digital assets for fans.\u201d South Korea-based Naver Z Corporation \u2014 the operator of metaverse platform Zepeto \u2014 has just raised 223.5 billion Korean won (US$189 million) in a Series B round, which included investments from SoftBank, Mirae Asset and major K-pop agencies JYP, YG Entertainment and HYBE. For K-pop singers, the rising NFT and metaverse wave could mean a new space for them to create something fresh and cutting-edge. \u201cAs idols who produce our own works, we are very proud of the creation we make and present. I\u2019m very excited that a new system will be established that will make it easier for me to share my creations with more people,\u201d said Kino, the main dancer, singer and rapper in PENTAGON, which debuted in 2016, in a video interview with Forkast.News. On top of singing and dancing, Kino is also known for his talent in painting and creating art. Kino added that a big reason why the K-pop market could grow rapidly is that the industry \u201cis not afraid of introducing and combining new technologies these days.\u201d As the Covid-19 pandemic continues to ravage the world, big entertainment companies have been making attempts to demonstrate how tech-savvy they are by offering unique virtual experiences for fans. For example, companies have been organizing online concerts and fan meetings with what\u2019s called a multi-view streaming system that allows fans to view the live performances from different camera positions. The metaverse also beckons with K-pop groups planning virtual concerts. Seo Eun-Kwang, the leader of boy band BTOB \u2014 which was formed by Cube in 2012 \u2014 gave a sneak peek at the new fan experience in the works. \u201cIn conversations with the band and the company, we\u2019ve started to talk about how to hold concerts in the metaverse,\u201d Seo said. Ahn said many K-pop fans are not just into the music. \u201cAs they start to like our music, I think they start empathizing and sharing a bond with different aspects of [the artists\u2019] lives,\u201d Ahn said. \u201cSo their attention encompasses not only K-pop, but also K-drama and K-culture in general. They show interest in all the cultural elements that shape us up.\u201d Seo said the metaverse can offer performers a new way to interact with fans, or \u201cMelody\u201d \u2014 the name for BTOB fans. \u201cWe can meet our Melody who we haven\u2019t met [in the metaverse], so that\u2019s what I\u2019m most excited about.\u201d However, the idea of NFTs and the metaverse may be intimidating for some fans. \u201cThere will be a bit of a steep learning curve. But K-pop fans are fairly persistent, so I can see them learning about it very quickly,\u201d said Thomas Baudinette, a lecturer at Macquarie University in Sydney whose research interests include K-pop innovations, in an interview with Forkast.News. Areum Jeong, an assistant professor who teaches Korean pop culture at Sichuan University-Pittsburgh Institute, describes K-pop fans as being highly networked and dedicated. \u201cThey\u2019re highly organized communities with very specific communal goals,\u201d Jeong said. \u201cEven if fans are not familiar with the process or how things work, they will teach you. They will team up. They will come up with how-to tutorials on YouTube or Twitter in like seven different languages.\u201d Baudinette added that the fact that many K-pop companies are jumping on the NFT and metaverse bandwagon is a bit like \u201cmonkey see, monkey do\u201d in order not to be left behind and to satisfy a cultural drive toward innovation. \u201cIf one of your competitors does something, you need to do it or you\u2019ll be left behind,\u201d Baudinette said.
