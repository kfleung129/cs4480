The South Korean drama, or K-drama, \"My love from the Star\",  stars Gianna Jun \u2013 best known for her lead role in the  Hollywood film \"Blood: The Last Vampire\" \u2013 and Kim Soo Hyun.  The romantic comedy, which blends science fiction and fantasy  elements and tells of the encounter between an actress and an  alien stranded on Earth, has taken Asia by storm.

The tourism pull Hallyu \u2013 the Korean term for the popularity of South Korean  culture abroad \u2013 has boosted the country's tourism  sector. Inbound arrivals jumped 9.3 percent on  year to a record 12.2 million visitors in 2013,  statistics from the Korea Tourism Organization (KTO) show. The KTO has noted an increase in queries related to the drama  from tourists and trade partners since the drama ended its run in  February, a Singapore-based representative told CNBC. The show's filming locations have received a surge in interest  from Chinese holidaymakers, according to South Korean media,  perhaps not surprising considering that the drama chalked up over  2.5 billion views in the mainland. One favored destination is Petite France, a theme park in  Gapyeong that is two hours from Seoul by subway. Daily arrivals  at the park, where the fictional couple kissed, have increased  nearly seven-fold, with mainland tourists accounting for 60  percent of the rise, according to Korea.net.

The luxury brands that Jun wears throughout the series have  become highly sought after by fans. Meanwhile, lipsticks used in  the show \u2013 be it Yves Saint Laurent or Korean brand Laneige  \u2013 have sold out in South Korea, China and Singapore. In China, Jimmy Choo's \"Abel\" silver heels flew off the racks  after appearing in the second episode, the Beijing Youth  Daily reported. U.S. luggage manufacturer Samsonite also saw sales spike in China  after the lead actor, Kim, carried one of its backpacks. The  ripple effect has since scored Kim an endorsement deal with  Samsonite. Read MoreHow red lipstick helped win an  election Tuck into 'chimaek' The soap sensation also sparked a craze for \"chimaek\" \u2013 a  portmanteau for chicken and beer in Korean \u2013 in Asia given  the lead character's constant craving for the Korean delicious  past time. In Singapore, Korean fried chicken restaurant Kko Kko Nara said  takeout orders have increased nearly 20 percent since the series  aired. Some fans are willing to go the distance for the real deal. Singaporean Heather Chua will travel to South Korea in July.  Apart from various filming locations, \"chimaek\" is one item on  the twenty-five-year-old's to-do list. \"My friends and I are definitely visiting a Korean fried chicken  restaurant. We've been having 'chimaek' in Singapore but nothing  beats doing it in Korea,\" Chua told CNBC. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.
