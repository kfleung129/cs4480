It\u2019s like a new energy again.\u201d Kim, known professionally as Bekah, had once felt the energy of K-pop adulation as an original member of one of South Korea\u2019s top pop acts, After School. Since its 2009 debut, the girl group has showcased high-skill showgirl concepts (drum lines, tap dancing, pole dancing \u2014 \u201cWe loved being different,\u201d Bekah says). But the troupe is also unique as the only K-pop act with a graduation/admission process, with membership ranging from five to nine girls since their 2009 debut. Singer/rapper Bekah was the second member to leave the group, exiting in 2011 after recording a goodbye \u201cgraduation\u201d track, \u201cTake Me to the Place,\u201d and disappearing from the K-pop limelight.

While fans mostly wanted details about her personal life (e.g. her K-pop crush), the Hawaii native sat down to share her what the life of a K-pop star is really like. With a built-in method to keep members fresh (i.e. the newest member, 17-year-old Kaeun, joined in spring 2012), After School may seemingly epitomize the \u201cfactory\u201d label that Western outlets (including\u00a0SPIN,\u00a0The New Yorker\u00a0and\u00a0Forbes)\u00a0use to describe the K-pop scene. But Bekah insists that it\u2019s characterized by people working hard to transform into actual artists on the side. \u201cThey decide that path in the beginning,\u201d the 24-year-old explains. \u201cBefore they become an artist, they need to choose the K-pop path. They\u2019re the ones that are taking the time to do the training sessions. A \u2018factory\u2019 is more like you\u2019re being made. These people already want to do it. I. There\u2019s a passion that goes into it before everything else.\u201d A passion that keeps artists going despite borderline-inhumane schedules. \u201cThe worst thing was not sleeping,\u201d she says. \u201cWe came home with an hour and thirty minutes left [until the next activity]. I had to wash my makeup off, shower and I went to sleep. But by then, I only had 30 minutes to wake up again at 6:00 a.m.\u201d  While some may see After School\u2019s agency Pledis Entertainment\u2019s (home to fellow K-pop idols Son Dam Bi, HELLOVENUS and NU\u2019EST) treatment of the group as harsh, Bekah is adamant she was treated well. \u201cI like the boss a lot. I never got into any arguments,\u201d she says. \u201cWe ended on good terms; they threw me a party.\u201d  Despite her cheery sendoff, the former K-popper does still caution those craving superstar status. \u201cYou got to know that all that glitters is not gold,\u201d she warns. \u201cThink about it, finish high school and have a Plan B. It\u2019s a business! It\u2019s a business for people, even though, for the audience it\u2019s not. I\u2019m not going to promise you it\u2019s great \u2014 especially not all the time. But if it\u2019s your dream and you have a feeling, do it. I\u2019m not going to tell you to do it. It\u2019s a lot of work; a lot of work.\u201d Still, all that work can parlay into K-pop success, best characterized when an act\u2019s single lands wins on weekly K-pop music chart programs that name a champion after each episode based on sales, streaming and fan voting. After School got their first taste of prize-winning with \u201909 single \u201cBecause of You,\u201d an electronic dance-ballad hybrid. Watch them attempt to perform an encore performance, through tears, after winning their third week in a row on music program \u201cInkigayo\u201d below.  \u201cIt was a shock,\u201d she reflects of winning a music program. \u201cAll this hard work just exploded that day. It was like, \u2018Wow, you guys really like us. Thank you so much.\u2019 I was ecstatic.\u201d Bekah also reveals that chart success doesn\u2019t mean the group can slack off. In fact, in meant even harder work. She adds, \u201cOnce we learned that it was going up on the charts, we would practice even longer. We\u2019d do knee-highs, running around the rehearsal room, singing that song for 10 hours.  \u201cIt\u2019s hard work\u2026\u201d she adds before pausing.\u201dAnd it\u2019s worth it. Right?\u201d While Bekah wonders about After School\u2019s future (\u201cIt\u2019s not just difficult for the group adjusting to new people, I\u2019d say it\u2019s difficult for fans, too\u2026 luckily, fans usually just love to support that other member\u201d), she adds that her proponents can expect a comeback soon. \u201cI will be back. Be patient, please,\u201d she says of a future career as either a solo artist or as a part of a new group. \u201cI may not have been doing anything for a while, but my Twitter still blows up. It\u2019s like \u2018Wow, you guys really care about who I am.\u2019 I\u2019m just me. I just want to say thank you for showing that kind of love.\u201d  Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.
