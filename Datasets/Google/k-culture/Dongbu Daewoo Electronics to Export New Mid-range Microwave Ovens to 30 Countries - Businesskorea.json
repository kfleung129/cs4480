    "text": " Dongbu Daewoo Electronics Corp., a South Korean consumer electronics maker, has released its new microwave oven lineup and will export them to 30 countries at the same time. The new lineups, which consist of eight 20-liter products, have a larger interior space for convenience and save energy by reducing standby power. First, the company has expanded the width of the products\u2019 interior space by 1.3 cm to 29 cm for added convenience, allowing users to put an 11-inch plate inside and cook larger amounts of food at once. It has also improved the thawing rates by more than 10 percent compared with the previous model so that users can uniformly defrost frozen foods and enjoy the texture of its food ingredients. In addition, the new products automatically cut off the power supply by blocking standby power when users don\u2019t operate them for 10 minutes. Therefore, users don\u2019t have to unplug them to block standby power. With its new \u201cShiny Clean\u201d system, which applies a high-density coating to the interior of the products, users can easily clean the inside after use. The built-in glass turntable plates inside also enable users to use the products more safely and easily put dishes in and out. The new lineup has adopted a rounded stylish design both inside and out using various colors, including black, orange, lime, red and silver. Based on eight fully automatic and dial operated products, Dongbu Daewoo Electronics has unveiled more than 150 derivative models by region around the world, and will export them to around 30 countries such as the United Kingdom, Spain and Peru.
