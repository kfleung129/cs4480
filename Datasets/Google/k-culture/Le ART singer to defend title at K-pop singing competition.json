The 2017 winner of a K-pop singing competition is set to defend her crown as Wellington gears up for the\u00a0K-Culture Festival this weekend. Korean pop enthusiasts from around New Zealand will sing and dance to their favourite K-pop songs at the national contest.\u00a0Two winners will compete to progress to an international online final \u2013 giving them the chance to compete in the world finals in Changwon, South Korea, later in the year. Roseta Lopa, 15, impressed the judges last year with her rendition of\u00a0Come Back Home by hip-hop band\u00a02NE1. The Porirua College student\u00a0\u2013 who had a taste of stardom recently when her group Le ART went viral for their version of the New Zealand national anthem\u00a0\u2013 said she was drawn into the world of K-pop by chance. \u201cIt was an accident. My sister was really interested in K-dramas, so I was reeled in by the soundtracks, which I discovered was a branch of the vast genre of K-pop. \u201cI loved what I heard and decided to discover more artistes, modern and old.\u201d Roseta Lopa (right) won the Vocal Category of the K-pop contest in 2017\u2019s K-Culture Festival. The appeal of K-pop is in the lyrics and production value, said Roseta. \u201cI love how poetic Korean songs can be. One of my most favourite aspects of K-pop is that most songs have substance with a lot of musical ingenuity in the production and writing of songs\u00a0\u2013 something I feel that Western music has begun to lack.\u201d Learning to sing in Korean was a challenge, but going through it with native speakers has helped. \u201cIt is nerve-racking performing in front of native Koreans, and very difficult as it is not a language I am fluent in. But with the exposure to the language through K-pop music over the past few years, I have sort of got the hang of it. \u201cMy tip would be to always check pronunciation with someone fluent in the language, as sometimes subtle differences in pronunciation can change the meaning of songs drastically.\u201d Roseta, a big fan of K-pop superstar IU, also lists Ailee, BIGBANG, Lee Sun Hee and So Hyang among her favourite K-pop artistes. Any hints as to what she\u2019ll be performing this weekend? \u201cYou\u2019ll have to come down to hear it! Hope to see you there!\u201d The\u00a02018 K-Culture Festival\u00a0takes place 12.30pm\u20136pm on Saturday, 28 July, at the Michael Fowler Centre in Wellington. As well as the K-pop contest, it features performances by hip-hop dancers Gorilla Crew, b-boy group Gamblerz, and more traditional percussion music and dance performances. \u2013 Asia Media Centre ",
