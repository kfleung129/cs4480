Now, some K-pop fans are claiming another victory: helping foil United States President Donald Trump\u2019s return to the campaign trail. K-pop fans are taking over 'White Lives Matter' and other anti-Black hashtags with memes and fancams of their favorite stars Ahead of his Saturday night rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Trump bragged that he had about 1 million RSVPs. But when the arena didn\u2019t even reach its 19,000-person capacity, many people online were quick to give K-pop fans and TikTok users at least partial credit for the low turnout. Prior to the rally, people on social media platforms TikTok and Twitter encouraged people to register to attend Trump\u2019s event \u2013 and not attend. One video, with more than 300,000 views, called on fans of South Korean mega group BTS in particular to join the trolling campaign. Following the rally, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted at Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale, telling him he had been \u201crocked\u201d by teens on TikTok flooding the Trump campaign with fake ticket reservations. \u201cKpop allies, we see and appreciate your contributions in the fight for justice too,\u201d she added. It\u2019s not clear how much of a role the social media campaign \u2013 or K-pop fans \u2013 had in the low turnout. Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale told CNN Sunday that \u201cleftists and online trolls\u201d who thought they had impacted rally attendance \u201cdon\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about or how our rallies work.\u201d He added bogus numbers had been weeded out, saying \u201cthese phony ticket requests never factor into our thinking.\u201d But the fact that K-pop fans may have been involved shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise \u2013 it\u2019s part of a long history of social activism and charity work led by online devotees. In the past month alone, K-pop fans have used their vast social media networks to effect change. Earlier this month, K-pop fans drowned out racist voices by posting images of K-pop groups using anti-Black hashtags, such as #WhiteLivesMatter. After the Dallas Police Department asked people on Twitter to submit video of \u201cillegal activity from the protests\u201d to its IWatch Dallas app, K-pop fans flooded the app with fancams \u2013 or clips of K-pop idols \u2013 prompting the app to crash. And after popular boy band BTS donated $1 million to support the Black Lives Matter movement, BTS fan-based charity fundraising group \u201cOne In An ARMY\u201d helped raise another $1 million for the cause. \u201cGiven the diversity of ARMY (the name of BTS\u2019 fandom) and their oft-expressed strong desire to help others, it\u2019s unsurprising that ARMY wanted to support the Black Lives Matter movement,\u201d the group said in a statement at the time. To the uninitiated, good causes and K-pop might seem like an unlikely marriage. But K-pop fans have been doing good work for the community for decades, said CedarBough Saeji, a visiting assistant professor in Asian Languages and Cultures at Indiana University, Bloomington. In the world of K-pop, music stars are known as idols, and are expected to set an example of how to act in society. They inspire passionate fandoms \u2013 and in the past, some idols would receive thousands of gifts a day from their ardent fans, Saeji said. Around two decades ago, K-pop groups began asking their fans to stop sending gifts and instead give to charity, she said. Since then, K-pop fandoms in South Korea have done volunteer work and donated to charity in their idol\u2019s name. Super Junior\u2019s fans donated bags of rice to the Salvation Army, for instance, while Block B fans raised money to build a well in Cambodia, CNN affiliate SBS reported. This all had the effect of making the idol in question look like they were contributing to society \u2013 and portraying fans as more than obsessive devotees. BTS' army of admirers: Inside one of the world's most powerful fandoms \u201cFans practice such activities not only for local charities, but also as a way of promoting their stars,\u201d Sun Jung, from the National University of Singapore, wrote in a 2012 research paper. She noted that, while K-pop fandoms can \u201ccreate a nuisance\u201d online, they can also lead to new forms of social activism. Even now, members of BTS\u2019s ARMY are told not to give any gifts to the pop stars, aside from handwritten letters. At BTS concerts, there are often bins for donating goods to local charities, Saeji said. And as K-pop has gone global, international fanbases have continued that spirit of donating or doing good work in their idol\u2019s name. In March 2018, BTS fan Erika Overton, a Brooklyn native in her late 30s, co-founded One In An ARMY, a fan collective which partners with non-profits to encourage the fandom to make small donations to a chosen cause. According to its website, the group has helped raise money to fund meals for Syrian refugees and formula for babies in Venezuela. Last year, Overton told CNN that she saw supporting projects to help those in need as a natural extension of being a BTS fan. \u201cThey put a lot of effort into giving us of themselves and their music and their sincerity \u2026 the ARMY really wants to give back in their name.\u201d While there are some groups \u2013 such as One In An ARMY \u2013 which come together for social causes, much of the work K-pop fans do isn\u2019t through an organized chain of command. Why the past decade saw the rise and rise of East Asian pop culture K-pop fandoms unite organically to get their idol\u2019s name to trend on Twitter on their birthday, or stream their favorite band\u2019s songs and videos as many times as possible so they get to the top of the music charts. The go-to space tends to be Twitter, meaning fans understand how to use algorithms to achieve their goals. It\u2019s not a big leap to use that same process of organizing online for social issues. \u201cIt is literally just people who are in contact with people through social media,\u201d Saeji says. \u201cThis is happening naturally.\u201d In the US, K-pop fans tend to be outward-looking and progressive, and many are people of color or members of the LGBTQ community, Saeji said. Given that, it\u2019s not surprising that K-pop fandoms would be active in their support of Black Lives Matter \u2013 or opposing Trump. The real takeaway from K-pop fans\u2019 recent successes isn\u2019t necessarily the power of K-pop fandoms, but the power of young people, says Saeji. \u201cYoung people today know how to organize online,\u201d she said. \u201cThey do have political opinions and they are interested in politics and making political change.\u201d CNN\u2019s Alicia Lee and Donie O\u2019Sullivan contributed reporting. \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network.
