File photo by Jon Chase/Harvard Staff Photographer By Corydon Ireland Harvard Staff Writer DateNovember 18, 2013May 6, 2019 Harvard\u2019s pre-eminent scholar of post-colonial literature, Homi K. Bhabha \u2014 born in India, educated in England, and a longtime professor in America \u2014 has traveled the world, including many stops in Paris. Bhabha is there today to represent the intellectual and academic world in front of an international body whose chief mission is peace through education and culture. The United Nations Education, Cultural, and Scientific Organization (UNESCO) is hosting an installation ceremony for Director-General Irina Bokova. The 61-year-old native of Bulgaria was just elected to her second four-year term. \u201cShe\u2019s an extremely powerful but modest person,\u201d said Bhabha, the Anne F. Rothenberg Professor of the Humanities, of Bokova, a onetime ambassador, foreign minister, and parliamentarian. \u201cShe\u2019s a great listener,\u201d he added, saying, \u201cShe does not sit easily with commonplace ideas.\u201d The installation ceremony is part of a UNESCO plenary session. On hand for Bhabha\u2019s 10-minute speech, one of three for the evening, were representatives of the organization\u2019s 195 member states, along with other luminaries. Bokova is the first woman and the first Eastern European to be director-general. She is also a proponent of what she calls the \u201cnew humanism,\u201d a set of universal values that acknowledges the world\u2019s diversity and provides a framework for cultural cooperation. The invitation to speak said new humanism was a thread running through Bokova\u2019s first term, and will \u201cconstitute a major axis\u201d during her second. \u201cCultural diversity for humanity is like biodiversity for nature,\u201d she said in a brief acceptance speech following her Nov. 12 re-election. \u201cNowadays, it\u2019s not sufficient to say we tolerate each other.\u201d Shortly after the 9/11 attacks, UNESCO enshrined its ideals of inclusion and acceptance in the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity. Bokova\u2019s new humanism is her own expression of those ideals. New humanism is compatible with Bhabha\u2019s longtime global campaign on behalf of the humanities, what he calls an integrative set of disciplines that provide an ethical framework in a world riven by cultural strife, a world in need of a way to communicate shared values. His speech, Bhabha told the Gazette before leaving, would describe new humanism as a means of negotiation at a time \u201cwhen secular and religious beliefs are in a struggle with each other.\u201d Bokova has her own name for the balm that humanism could bring to the world stage: \u201csoftware for peace.\u201d More than ever, \u201cwe need some way, some non-authoritarian way, to assert positive values across the world,\u201d said Bhabha, who is also director of Harvard\u2019s Mahindra Humanities Center. \u201cWe need to be able to invoke authority when we make decisions today.\u201d The humanities, after all, offer important ways to make \u201cconnections across systems of thought,\u201d he said. That includes bridging the artificial divides that public discourse sometimes creates between art and literature and science and technology. In the past, Bokova has made the same point about cultural connectivity. She likes to draw a parallel between health-giving diversity in nature and its counterpart in the world\u2019s cultures. In his speech, Bhabha planned to use the same analogy: \u201cSustainability is often spoken of as an ecological issue, but it is no less an issue of our moral economy. Sustainability is as much a matter of the balance of social forces as it is a moral measure that regulates equitable outcomes in an uneven and unequal world.\u201d Bokova\u2019s new humanism offers a way to progress in human affairs, Bhabha believes. But like any view of humanism, it acknowledges the contradictions of the human condition, the clash of aspiration with reality. Today, the contradictions between humanism\u2019s aspirations and its reality pile up around issues. Bhabha acknowledged the fruitful \u201cconnectivity\u201d that global markets and technologies offer. But his speech also mentioned the counterpoints of economist Joseph Stiglitz and others, who warn that the International Monetary Fund and entities like it are sometimes viewed as new versions of colonialism. These contradictions offer a lesson for the new humanism, Bhabha said in his speech, that it \u201ccan never be dogmatic or doctrinaire. Ideas that have a global significance must be open to global doubt.\u201d So healthy doubt \u2014 with its questions and its dearth of certitudes \u2014 underlies the new humanism. Bhabha calls it \u201can aspirational project,\u201d not \u201ca programmatic set of beliefs.\u201d At the same time, it can be what Bhabha calls an \u201carmature of action.\u201d Bokova has said too that new humanism is policy, not philosophy. Education could provide one example of that policy in action. The humanities are predicated on \u201cinclusion and diversity,\u201d Bhabha said, and education is served best by being the same way. Yet the global \u201cmap of knowledge\u201d in the Internet age, he says, is \u201cdeeply distorted.\u201d The Web is actually not so wide, according to Bhabha. It\u2019s an information archive and retrieval system that has a Western bias. On Wikipedia, for instance, 84 percent of articles relate to Europe and North America. At the same time, more articles appear there on Antarctica \u201cthan any country in Africa or South America,\u201d he said, another sign of \u201ceducational un-sustainability.\u201d More support for the humanities could make up for gaps in the worldwide map of knowledge, Bhabha offered. But funding is a problem. One survey shows that U.S. expenditures for science and engineering are 46 times higher than for the humanities. But Bhabha sees reason for hope, as Bokova does. With its mandate of cultural exchange as a means of peace, UNESCO is still aspirational. That\u2019s OK, Bhabha says, because it remains \u201cthe \u2018not yet\u2019 that binds us to protecting and transforming the world as we know it.\u201d Course examines wide-ranging problem that touches on sexuality, body weight, immigration, and poverty Med School-MGH dermatologists use lasers to remove gang, trafficking tattoos Indian herpetologists bring their life\u2019s work to Harvard just as study shows a world increasingly hostile to the fate of amphibians A visiting scholar suggests that Nefertiti (photo 1) wasn\u2019t quite who people imagine she was, and eventually was revered as something of a sex goddess.
