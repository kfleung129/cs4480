    "text": "By \n\n\tScott Rafferty Mike Krzyzewski has  won five NCAA championships and mentored some of this generation\u2019s greatest basketball players during his 35-year career at Duke, and no coach in Division I hoops has won more games. And yet, despite being a Hall of Famer who regularly rubs shoulders with the likes of LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and President Obama, he was a nervous wreck when he first met Queen Bey. You\u2019ve probably seen the photo of Coach K and Beyonc\u00e9 posing together, taken a few years ago, when he was presenting James with Sports Illustrated\u2018s Sportsman of the Year award. What you can\u2019t see, though, is the normally unflappable court general sweating bullets and shaking in his sneakers from merely being in her presence. As Coach K explained to local station WRAL, he was snapping a photo with Jay Z and LeBron \u2013 you know, as one does \u2013 toward the end of the event when the fan inside of him decided it was finally time to meet Beyonc\u00e9, who was sitting a couple of seats away from him all night long. But instead of asking someone like her husband to make the introduction, he mustered the courage to do it himself\u2026and that\u2019s when it all started to go pear shaped.  The best in their respective professions\u2026 A photo posted by Duke Basketball (@dukeblueplanet) on Dec 6, 2012 at 6:56am PST  \u201cI had to meet her,\u201d Krzyzewski remembered. \u201cSo I said \u2018I\u2019m Coach K\u2019 and she says \u2018Coach, I just heard you speak for 10 minutes. I know who you are.\u2019 So I felt like 13. Then I asked her \u2013 something I hardly ever ask anyone to do \u2013 would you please take a picture with me?\u201d Sadly, the picture didn\u2019t go smoothly, either. \u201cMy face is all red and I look like I\u2019m 11,\u201d he sheepishly explained. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t show her patting me on the head.\u201d Trending\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt Least 22 Dead and Suspect at Large in Maine Shooting\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDuran Duran Have Gone Fully Goth on Their New Album.
