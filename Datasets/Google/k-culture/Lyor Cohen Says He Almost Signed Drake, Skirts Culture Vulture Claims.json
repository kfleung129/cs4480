    "text": "YouTube's Global head of music also side-stepped a question about being photographed with Kanye West and a MAGA cap on \"The Breakfast Club.\" By \n\n\tA.D. Amorosi For a guy who has genuinely been at the forefront of the hip-hop business since the early 1980s, Lyor Cohen \u2013 a major league manager at Rush Productions, a boss at Def Jam,\u00a0 the man behind 300 Entertainment and YouTube\u2019s current Global Head of Music \u2013 isn\u2019t known for being all that chatty, which is what made Cohen\u2019s candid, history-spanning, 70-minute appearance on morning radio show \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d on Wednesday (August 1) unique. Cohen gave Breakfast Club co-hosts DJ Envy, Angela Yee and Charlamagne Tha God the goods on everything from his pre-industry employment (\u201cI worked for the National Bank of Israel\u201d), to Drake\u2019s rumored signing to Def Jam before his Cash Money deal (\u201cThe truth is Drake shook my hand\u201d), to going against the grain of Jewish record executives who encouraged him not to do business with Public Enemy (Cohen took Chuck D to the Holocaust Museum out of spite), to winding up in a selfie with Universal Music Group chairman Lucian Grainge and a Trump-loving Kanye West wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap. \u201cI didn\u2019t see the hat\u2026 I was fully immersed in the experience [and] honored to be there,\u201d he said of the photo opp at West\u2019s Calabasas home.  Cohen recalled his early days entertainment job when he got to New York City was bringing Run-DMC on the road, and coming up with the phrase \u201cWho\u2019s house? Run\u2019s house!\u201d on the \u201cTougher Than Leather\u201d album. He also spilled a dab of tea on several of the artists he\u2019s known and worked with in his time, including Rich The Kid wanting to leave 300 Entertainment, and the troubled DMX (surprisingly, the no-nonsense Cohen will sign artists with drug or crime problems because he\u2019ll take \u201ctalent over issues\u201d any day). When Charlamagne brought up Dame Dash\u2019s recent claims that it was Cohen who busted up Roc-A-Fella Records, Cohen told the host to ask Jay-Z and Dash about that issue. \u201cWho\u2019s Dame Dash? I don\u2019t even know him,\u201d said Cohen. Charlamagne clapped back testily, \u201cY\u2019all made a lot of money together,\u201d and threw out the notion that Cohen built his career by being a \u201cculture vulture.\u201d Cohen sidestepped the criticism. Then there\u2019s the aforementioned Drake deal that still seems to deeply disappoint Cohen. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. He didn\u2019t stop the party. I\u2019m happy for him, and I\u2019m happy for his fans. It\u2019s all good. It didn\u2019t hurt my feelings, but I\u2019m old school. I come from a different thing.\u201d Those old school business dealings and notions of loyalty and values were much on Cohen\u2019s mind considering how he handles his business, in the past and in the present. There is the currency of signing new artists for big bucks based on internet memes and Instagram hits rather than time in or song craft. Cohen called that \u201cday-trading\u201d and would prefer to see labels returning to the old days of artist development. There is a focus, on Cohen\u2019s part, of artists getting in on\u00a0 the \u201cYou Tube hustle\u2026. creating your own channel,\u00a0 figuring out that algorithm.\u201d Then there is the competition of throwing around million dollar deals just to land the next hot name.  \u201cI never signed an act because I was afraid of losing them. I only signed an act because I wanted them on my label. Different mentality these days. I never signed an act because \u2026 \u2018another label is interested in me,\u2019 I say \u2018Go ahead with yourself. I\u2019m not interested in you anymore.\u201d Modestly, he stated, \u201cI\u2019ve touched more rap music than everybody combined.\u201d Cohen focused too on the question of \u201cwhat is a label in the 21st Century,\u201d and, for artists preparing to sign their name to a deal, \u201cto do so with their eyes wide open. Labels want to sign smart.\u201d As for executives poised for success in what Cohen calls the coming \u201cgolden age of the music business,\u201d he predicts Quality Control\u2018s\u00a0Kevin \u201cCoach K\u201d Lee and Pierre \u201cPee\u201d Thomas will \u201cmake fortunes\u201d and be the impresarios of tomorrow.
