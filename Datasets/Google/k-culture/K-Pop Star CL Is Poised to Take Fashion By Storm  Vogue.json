By Mark Guiducci Sitting across the table at Spot, a Korean dessert bar on St. Marks Place, K-pop star CL looks every bit like a die-hard fashion girl. She\u2019s rocking a Tom Ford chinchilla of alternating aquamarine, navy, and royal blues; her shoes are Rick Owens x Adidas; her vintage T-shirt, a Tokyo souvenir, is from a Nirvana tour that happened four years before she was born. She\u2019s talking about her dinner last night with Alexander Wang. But to the other patrons of this little eatery, CL is a superstar; the breakout act from Korea\u2019s biggest girl group, 2NE1; a unicorn with the silver mane to prove it. When she orders an iced green tea latte with bubbles, the waiter delivers more than a dozen sweet dishes to our table. An employee from a neighboring Korean restaurant brings her a large bag of takeout food, just to be polite. Anonymous on the streets of New York, she may as well be Rihanna in here. And the rest of us are about to see what the fuss is about. CL Born to Korean parents, CL was raised between Paris and Japan, leaving little wonder how she became such a fashion plate. \u201cI feel like an alien sometimes, where I don\u2019t feel like I belong anywhere,\u201d she admits. \u201cCulturally, I\u2019m not 100 percent Korean. I\u2019m very mixed, and very open.\u201d Crucially, CL possesses a mastery of the English language and a breakthrough solo album, still in the works, that is being carefully shepherded by Belieber-in-chief Scooter Braun. CL has been in show business since she was 15\u2014\u201cKorea is different,\u201d she explains over a green tea lava cake, one of our many dessert dishes, \u201ceverybody auditions for the [record] labels.\u201d She was one-fourth of 2NE1, the Asian sensation whose biggest hit has landed 145 million hits on YouTube to date (the song\u2019s to-the-point title translates to \u201cI Am the Best\u201d). \u201c2NE1 was special because we each had different characters and styles, for individual tastes,\u201d she says, likening the band to the Spice Girls. \u201cI was the tough one, the tomboy.\u201d The toughness shows through, but so does CL\u2019s curiosity and obvious savvy for the world and her place in it. These days, CL is to 2NE1 what Beyonc\u00e9 was to Destiny\u2019s Child. Poised to break through in the West with a debut single called \u201cHello Bitches,\u201d you could say CL is the anti-Adele. She might soon be called the Korean Katy, and might one day be dubbed the new Nicki. Today, however, on her 25th birthday, it\u2019s enough to know that CL is, without a doubt, a star.
