Samsung Electronics announced on 26 July 2021 a new partnership with CJ ENM, Asia\u2019s leading entertainment and media group behind the Oscar-winning film\u00a0\u2018Parasite\u2019, to build a virtual production studio to spearhead the production of future video content. Combining its cutting-edge Micro LED technology with CJ ENM\u2019s globally recognized content production of television series and films, Samsung is taking the next step in a new initiative to innovate in the rapidly expanding virtual production market.  Through this partnership, Samsung will supply its state-of-the-art display technology, The Wall, to CJ ENM\u2019s virtual studio, a part of its television and film production studio complex scheduled to open in Paju, Korea later this year. The custom virtual production volume studio will be the first in the world to leverage The Wall\u2019s boundless LED technology, unlocking new possibilities for video content production operations and virtual production solutions. The main display will be installed in an oval shape with a diameter of 20 meters and a height of seven meters or more, creating a seemingly endless backdrop to capture content.    \u201cWe are excited to collaborate with CJ ENM to build a virtual production studio featuring Samsung\u2019s most cutting-edge display technologies,\u201d said Jong-hee Han, President of Visual Display Business at Samsung Electronics. \u201cWith this partnership, Samsung is launching a new virtual production industry initiative with a commitment to deliver innovative products and solutions that offer the optimal environment for next-generation content production.\u201d  This virtual production studio will use LED displays and connected cameras to create virtual settings in real-time. This solution will save time and reduce image compositing and on-location production costs while helping filmmakers to see the camera on the live-action set in any direction.  The Wall\u2019s modular technology allows creators to design environments to their specific requirements, enabling a variety of installation options such as ceiling installation and convex or concave design, depending on the internal studio design.    The 2021 model of The Wall (Model Name: IWA) with Micro LED technology enhances visual expression with ultra-deep blacks and wide viewing angles, giving filmmakers and content creators the ultimate canvas to fulfill their visions. The modular screens are ideal for studios thanks to their precise color expression, HDR10+ and cinema LED picture quality technology and optimized frame rates for production houses. A new molding process is also applied to the modular surfaces of The Wall to minimize any moir\u00e9 patterns from forming, a nuisance typically associated with filming standard LED screens.  The Wall\u2019s massive screen measures over 1,000 inches, producing vibrant colors and details supporting up to 16K high-resolution1\u00a0content. Dedicated frame rates for studio production, a new addition to this year\u2019s model, allows producers to run content at frame rates such as 23.976, 29.97 and 59.94Hz, ensuring seamless videos sync with the most widely used camera framerates. Frame Rate Sync technology further reduces screen disruptions for true-to-life accuracy. With thoughtful dust and contamination-resistant LED protective films, plus a variety of easy-to-use solutions, such as remote management and color adjustment, The Wall is built for convenient management in any environment.  CJ ENM Virtual Studio Concept Visual  Both companies expect this collaboration to improve content production possibilities while satisfying a variety of customers by reimagining content production for today\u2019s fast-paced entertainment environment.  \u201cThe strategic partnership with Samsung will allow CJ ENM to push forward the creation of a new powerhouse of the next-generation content,\u201d said Ho-sung Kang, CJ ENM CEO. \u201cWhile CJ ENM is investing $4.4 billion over the next five years in entertainment content, we are taking the lead in building a global No. 1 production studio to become a world leading entertainment company.\u201d   About CJ ENM\nCJ ENM is Asia\u2019s leading entertainment and lifestyle company headquartered in Seoul, Korea.
