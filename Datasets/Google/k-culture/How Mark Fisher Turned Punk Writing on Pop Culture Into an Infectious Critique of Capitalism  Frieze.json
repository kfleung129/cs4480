    "text": "From capitalist realism to acid communism, new anthology K-Punk demonstrates the reach of the late writer\u2019s cultural criticism Amongst the most obstinate tendencies of contemporary criticism is the justification of the past in terms of the present, Mark Fisher wrote in his 2005 blogpost \u2018The Outside of Everything, Now\u2019. It\u2019s one of those cutting observations so characteristic of his work; a mere digression from a wider discussion of post-punk\u2019s cultural politics, but one that challenges much of how we think of popular culture. After all, to prohibit assessments of cultural products on the basis of their influence, would be to compel critics to appraise them on their own terms. One suspects many would have little left to say. It\u2019s a notion indicative of what made Fisher\u2019s writing punk \u2013 K-Punk happens to be the title of his long-running blog as well as his newly collected writings, published this month by Repeater Books. Inasmuch as both rejected postwar consumer culture, punks weren\u2019t so different to critical theorists. Only punks, as Greil Marcus has it in his monumental Lipstick Traces (1989), did so with a joy mostly absent among po-faced theoreticians. If Fisher is punk then, it\u2019s insofar as he rarely condescends to pop culture. Indeed, his enthusiasm for his material is infectious, his ferocity when it lets him down is admirable. He frequently praises his favourite writers and critics for scrambling the hierarchy between high theory and pop, but it\u2019s a mode of writing of which Fisher is exemplary.

Courtesy: Repeater Books According to punk convention, commercial success entails aesthetic failure, but Fisher was oriented towards selling out from the start. That is, he premised meaningful social change upon the left\u2019s recovery of a cultural hegemony it lost, in Britain at least, to the dominance of neoliberal capitalism in the 1980s. It\u2019s especially fascinating, in this context, to view the gestation of Fisher\u2019s ideas in K-Punk as they emanate from the relative obscurity of blogging to wider outlets. As he, along with many of his peers, moved into publishing and academia, owing occasionally to the notoriety of their blogs, Fisher\u2019s ideas endured the unlikely transformation from anonymous appraisals of mass culture, to becoming a small part of it. In this regard, the presses he co-founded, first Zero then later Repeater, became important vessels for left political and cultural criticism. More widely, his influence is discernible in a whole archipelago of independent writing and publishing that\u2019s sprung up in the UK and elsewhere in the last decade. Part of Fisher\u2019s success can be put down to his facility with memorable neologisms and phrases that, encapsulating broad sets of ideas, helped them to circulate smoothly and widely. The best known of these is \u2018capitalist realism\u2019, a reference to a collapsed political imaginary characteristic of British social life, which Fisher dates to the defeat of the miners\u2019s strike in 1985. Another, \u2018hauntology\u2019, denotes a pervasive mourning for lost belief in the future; it\u2019s recited by critics often enough that it ought probably to be proscribed by editors by now. One more, \u2018acid communism\u2019, was to be the title of a future book; and while Fisher died tragically last year before its completion, the arguments it was to present have since disseminated widely. The title gestures to a desire to revive counter-cultural experiences of sensuality and collectivity and, perhaps unexpectedly, it\u2019s a doctrine that\u2019s been taken up as a plank around Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour Party, especially in the form of \u2018Acid Corbynism\u2019 events. These fuse party politics with ideas of \u2018consciousness expansion\u2019 that Fisher was drawing upon as a potential break from the narrow cognitive horizon imposed by neoliberalism.

Photograph: Paul Samuel White As a form, blogs tend to generate prompt, concise, reactive writing, and Fisher is at ease in this rhetorical mode. He\u2019s inclined to declarative sentences, he deploys hyperbole with an enviable boldness. While, for instance, I\u2019ll never see The Fall\u2019s version of post-punk as anything but insipid nor view Fisher\u2019s disapproval of marijuana as anything besides misguided, his biases are nonetheless refreshing. Indeed, it\u2019s difficult to remember now, given the current ubiquity of theses on every imaginable artefact of contemporary culture, just how rare his sort of writing was in 2009, let alone when he began. At times though, his divide and conquer polemics fall flat. Condemnations of the left as either nostalgic Leninists or primitivist neo-anarchists, often reiterated, give little purchase on the recent history of British radicalism. Similarly, an opposition of punk \u2018proletarian discipline\u2019 to hippy \u2018fuzzed out psychedelic fascist drug talk\u2019, later repudiated, is reductive to say the least. But this is besides the point. Fisher\u2019s work is best when engaged in fine-grained examination: an essay on goth aesthetics, another on J.G. Ballard, and a widely cited article on producer Burial, are all standouts. The blogs and essays on television though, might be his finest work, perhaps because there\u2019s less baggage, less weight of a canon, where TV is concerned. An article from 2012, \u2018Beyond Good and Evil\u2019, that reads series Breaking Bad (2008\u201313) as the oedipal tragedy of the nuclear family in late capitalism is razor-sharp. Celebrity Big Brother becomes an opportunity to contemplate the effects of social media-induced anxiety upon popular culture in the 2015 essay \u2018The House That Fame Built\u2019. In fact, the latter serves to support a claim Fisher made repeatedly; despite its assertions to deliver the goods, what capital offers is, in reality, tawdry and predictable, if not outright depressing. All in all, it\u2019s as far-reaching an aesthetic critique of capitalism as we\u2019ve had in the past decade.
