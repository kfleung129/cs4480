The smell of freshly cut grass, the crack of the bat, the 30 minutes standing in line at the concession stand. Baseball season is up and running and the experience of going to a game wouldn\u2019t be the same without an expensive beer in one hand and a plastic receptacle\u00a0of nachos covered in ooey-gooey cheese product in the other. But how did nachos become a stadium standard? In September 1988,\u00a0Adriana P. Orr, a researcher at the\u00a0Oxford English Dictionary, was asked to trace the etymology of the word \u201cnachos\u201d and conducted an\u00a0initial investigation of the nacho story. She followed a paper trail of documents and newspaper articles until she found what she was looking for in the Hispanic Division of the Library of Congress: \u201cAs I walked down the long corridor leading back to the library\u2019s central core, I heard a voice softly calling my name. There was a young woman I recognized as a staff member of the Hispanic Division\u2026she told me she had been born and raised in Mexico and there, nacho has only one common usage: it is the word used as a diminutive for a little boy who had been baptized Ignacio. His family and friends call him Nacho\u2026\u00a0Now I was convinced there was a real Nacho somewhere who had dreamed up a combination of tortilla pieces with melted cheese and jalape\u00f1o peppers.\u201d Using this information, Orr tracked down a quote from the elusive\u00a01954\u00a0St Anne\u2019s Cookbook\u00a0printed by\u00a0The Church of the Redeemer, Eagle Pass, Texas, which includes a recipe for a dish called \u201cNachos Especiales.\u201d What Orr would find is that,\u00a0in 1943 in Piedras Negras, Mexico\u00a0\u2014 just across the border from Eagle Pass,\u00a0a group of hungry army wives were the first to eat the meal. When the ladies went to a restaurant called the Victory Club, the maitre d\u2019, Ignacio \u201cNacho\u201d Anaya greeted them. Without a chef around, Anaya threw together whatever food he could find in the kitchen that \u201cconsisted of near canapes of tortilla chips, cheese, and jalapeno peppers.\u201d The cheese of choice was reportedly\u00a0Wisconsin cheddar.\u00a0Anaya named the dish\u00a0Nachos Especiales\u00a0and it caught on\u2014on both sides of the border\u2014and the orignal title\u00a0was shortened to \u201cnachos.\u201d Anaya\u00a0died in 1975, but a bronze plaque was put up in Piedras, Negras, to honour his memory and October 21 was declared the\u00a0International Day of the Nacho. If Anaya is the progenitor of nachos especiales,\u00a0then how did it happen that Frank Liberto came to be known as \u201cThe Father of Nachos\u201d?\u00a0 Nachos were already popular at restaurants in Texas by the time Liberto\u2019s recipe hit the scene, but he\u2019s famous in the industry for bringing his version of the dish to the concession stand in 1976 at a Texas Rangers baseball game in Arlington, Texas. What he did that no one else had done before, was create the pump-able consistency of the orangey-gooey goodness we see today\u2014what the company calls \u201ccheese sauce.\u201d \u00a0Though some versions are Wisconsin\u00a0cheddar-based\u00a0like Anaya\u2019s original, according to the company most of the products are blends.\u00a0(According to the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s\u00a0standards, the sauce is\u00a0technically\u00a0not \u201ccheese,\u201d but that hasn\u2019t stopped fans from pumping it by the gallons since). Liberto\u2019s innovation didn\u2019t need to be refrigerated and had a longer shelf life. His recipe was top secret\u2014so secret that in 1983 a 29-year-old man was arrested for trying to buy trade secrets into Liberto\u2019s formula. As a concessionaire, transaction time was key\u2014Frank didn\u2019t want customers to wait more than a minute in line for their snack.\u00a0To meet this demand, he came up with the idea of warming up a can of cheese sauce, ladling it over the chips and then sprinkling jalape\u00f1os on top.\u00a0Frank\u2019s son and current president of Ricos Products Co., Inc.,\u00a0Anthony \u2018Tony\u2019 Liberto, was 13 when Ricos introduced the product in Arlington Stadium. He recalls that the concession operators wouldn\u2019t put the cheesy chips in the stands. They were afraid that the new product launch would cannibalize other popular items like popcorn, hotdogs and sodas. \u201cWe had to build our own nacho carts,\u201d \u00a0Liberto, now 50,\u00a0says. \u201cMy dad has an old VHS tape where people were lined up 20 people deep behind these concession carts. You\u2019d hear the crack of the bat and you\u2019d think that they\u2019d want to see what play was going on, but they stayed in line to get their nachos.\u201d This 35mm film trailer from the \u201970s starring Nacho, Rico and Pepe was created by Walt Disney animators and was used during intermission at movie theaters. Image courtesy of Ricos Products Co., Inc. It was an immediate success:\u00a0That season Arlington Stadium sold Ricos\u2019 nachos at the rate of one sale per every two-and-a-half patrons\u2014over $800,000 in sales. Popcorn, which previously had the highest sales, only sold to one in 14 patrons for a total of $85,000. There is one ingredient to thank for that shift, Liberto says: The jalape\u00f1o pepper. \u201cWhen you put a jalape\u00f1o pepper on chips and cheese, of course it\u2019s going to be spicy,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to start looking for your beverage\u2014a Coke or Pepsi, whatever\u2014you\u2019re gonna need something to drink.\u201d Beverage sales spiked and hotdog and popcorn sales thereafter, he says. By 1978, the spicy snack became available at the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 stadium, where iconic \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d announcer\u00a0Howard Cosell\u00a0would put nachos on the map. Cosell,\u00a0a household name for football fans, sat alongside Frank Gifford and Don Meredith giving viewers the play-by-play, when a plate of nachos was brought to the broadcast room. \u201cCosell was trying to take up some dead air and he says \u2018They brought us this new snack\u2014what do they call them? knock-o\u2019s or nachos?\u2019\u201d recalls Liberto. \u201cHe started using the word \u2018nachos\u2019 in the description of plays: \u2018Did you see that run? That was a nacho run!\u2019\u201d Cosell and others used the word for weeks after, allowing nachos to branch out from their Texas birthplace. \u201cMy father first sold a condensed formulation of the product,\u201d Tony says. \u201cYou open up the can, add water or milk and pepper juice to the mix.\u201d Each number ten can contains 107 ounces of the condensed cheese conconction to which 32 ounces of water and 20 ounces of pepper juice are added. Once combined, the cheese blend is put into a dispenser like the pump or button-operated machines you see at concession stands today. \u201cThat\u2019s an added\u00a052 ounces of servable product,\u201d Tony says. \u201cNearly 50 percent more sauce \u00a0Plus, the water is free and the pepper juice you get from the jalapenos anyway. You\u00a0get an additonal 52 0z to serve and it doesn\u2019t cost the company a dime.\u201d Just to make this profit thing clear\u2014some math: If you have an extra 52 ounces of product and each two-ounce serving of cheese sauce goes for four bucks a pop, that\u2019s 100 dollars directly into the concessionaire\u2019s cash register.

Tony has two children, a daughter (13) and a son (11), who he hopes will take an interest in working for the family business one day as he did. His niece,\u00a0Megan Petri (fifth generation), currently works for Ricos Products Co., Inc. \u201cWe can\u2019t go to any baseball game without getting an order of nachos,\u201d says Liberto. \u201c says \u2018I need my nachos I need my nachos.\u2019 It\u2019s like she needs her fix.\u201d His daughter is not alone in her affinity for her family\u2019s invention. As millions of people crunch into their plates of chips and cheesiness at baseball games and movie theaters around the world, one question remains: How much cheese is actually in the nacho sauce? \u201cI will not tell you that,\u201d he laughs.\u00a0\u201dWe\u2019ve got lots of formulas and that is a a trade secret\u2014you never want to give away how much cheese is in your product.\u201d Get the latest Travel & Culture stories in your inbox.
