    "text": "By Kim Ji-soo South Korea is making a cautious but strong bet that K-pop will propel the Korean economy in the years ahead, as global interest in hallyu \u2013 or the \u201cKorean wave\u201d of pop culture \u2013 continues to grow. The Korea Foundation recently released statistics related to hallyu worldwide, and said the number of fans of the Korean wave increased about 11 per cent \u2013 or nearly 100 million \u2013 in 2019 over the previous year. The foundation, which is affiliated with the Foreign Ministry, made the assessment by studying hallyu communities in 98 nations. As of December 2019, there were 1,799 hallyu fan clubs with 99.32 million fans. The foundation says interest in hallyu is growing due to increased distribution and consumption of Korean content through platforms such as YouTube, Netflix and SNS, the success of director Bong Joon-ho\u2019s film Parasite and the diversification of hallyu content itself. Lee Soo-man, chairman of South Korean entertainment conglomerate SM Entertainment, told a recent seminar he believed K-pop would grow through technological innovation and even hallyu celebrities in AI-powered avatars could even become part of our lives. Lee added that the rise of K-pop and other South Korean cultural content had increased interest in learning the Korean language at major universities around the world. \u201cHallyu has become not only global content but an important asset in our public diplomacy,\u201d said Korea Foundation president Lee Geun.
