    "text": "Women have long been packaged by South Korea\u2019s male-dominated entertainment industry as sex objects and scandals are not new. But a darker side than could have been imagined has been revealed by the latest offences. K-pop\u2019s fans are mostly women and the industry and South Korean government have promoted it as wholesome and pure; the lurid accounts of elicit spy cameras in restrooms, alleged rapes and videos of sex without consent have caused outrage. The inequality of women in Korean society has been highlighted along with their abuse and mistreatment. President Moon Jae-in has understandably interceded, calling for a thorough investigation of old and new scandals. The global standing of K-pop, which has rapidly grown to a US$5 billion annual industry, is threatened. Scrutiny of the money and power at the root of the crisis is good for the industry and introspection is welcome. But there also has to be change for Korea\u2019s women. ",
