OutdoorU hosts Collegebound, an optional but very popular outdoor orientation program and learning experience for incoming first-year or transfer students. Students choose between the base camp trip, backpacking trip or canoeing trip and often report that this experience increased their self-confidence and helped them make new friends before arriving on campus. OutdoorU Collegebound at CSB/SJU In 1998, Saint John\u2019s Abbey and University commissioned renowned calligrapher Donald Jackson to produce a hand-written, hand-illuminated Bible. We invite you to explore this work of art that unites an ancient Benedictine tradition with the technology and vision of today, illuminating the Word of God for a new millennium. The Saint John\u2019s Bible Gallery is located on the lower level of Alcuin Library on the Saint John\u2019s University Campus. The Saint John\u2019s Bible Artist-in-Residence Richard Bresnahan and The Saint John\u2019s Pottery engage students, apprentices and visiting artists in the work of artistic creation, discipline, and research and preparation of natural materials. These dynamic experiences are framed by questions of what it means to envision and create a sustainable lived system. Visitors are welcome in the studio to visit the gallery, purchase ceramics and take guided tours. Studio tours explore the cycles of clay processing and glaze development as well as preparation and firing of the Johanna Kiln each fall.
