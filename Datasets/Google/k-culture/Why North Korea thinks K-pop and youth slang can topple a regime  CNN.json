In the past decade, South Korea has emerged as a formidable cultural force, with products from makeup to K-pop and K-drama finding enthusiastic fans around the world. But one place trying to stop South Korean influence from permeating its borders is its neighbor to the north. For decades, North Korea has been almost completely closed off from the rest of the world, with tight control over what information gets in or out. Foreign materials including movies and books are banned, with only a few state-sanctioned exceptions; those caught with foreign contraband often face severe punishment, defectors say. Restrictions have softened somewhat in recent decades, however, as North Korea\u2019s relationship with China expanded. Tentative steps to open up have allowed some South Korean elements, including parts of its pop culture, to seep into the hermit nation \u2013 especially in recent years, when relations thawed between the two countries. But the situation in North Korea is now fast deteriorating \u2013 and strict rules have snapped back into place, in a crackdown reminiscent of its earlier, more isolated history. North Korea isn't talking to the South anymore. Experts say it could be trying to manufacture a crisis Earlier this month, South Korean lawmaker Ha Tae-keung said after attending a briefing by the country\u2019s spy agency that North Korea\u2019s regime was implementing strict rules on how young people dress and speak. For instance, South Korean women often use the term \u201coppa\u201d for their romantic partners \u2013 it\u2019s now forbidden in the North. Instead, North Korean women must refer to their lovers as \u201cmale comrades,\u201d said Ha. Propaganda videos in the country also denounce behaviors that show \u201cforeign influence,\u201d such as public displays of affection. Those who violate the rules are the \u201csworn enemy of the revolution,\u201d Ha said, citing South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service. Last Sunday, the regime blasted foreign ways of life in an article in state-run newspaper Rodong Sinmun, urging young people to be \u201cfaithful to the calling of their country.\u201d \u201cStruggle in the field of ideology and culture is a war without gunfire,\u201d said the article, citing North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Without specifically naming South Korea, it added that losing the culture war would \u201cbring many times more serious consequences than on the battlefield.\u201d Clothing, hairstyles and language were \u201ca reflection of the state of thought and spirit,\u201d it added. \u201cEven if young people sing and dance, they should sing and dance to the melodies and rhythms that fit the needs of the times and the national sentiment of our people, and flourish our style of culture.\u201d These restrictions may seem outlandish \u2013 but things like slang, innocuous on the surface, represent a much more complicated struggle over power and control, experts say. And North Korea\u2019s tolerance for foreign influence is in constant flux, shifting alongside its economic wellbeing and international diplomacy. North Korea\u2019s relationship with South Korea has remained fraught since the Korean War ended with an armistice in 1953. No peace treaty was ever signed, meaning the war never formally ended. North Korea had once been among the most industrially developed parts of East Asia, said Andrei Lankov, director of the Korea Risk Group and professor at Kookmin University in Seoul. But after decades of isolation, its people now live in grinding poverty. The North Korean economy spiraled downward in the 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union, which ended the flow of aid into the country, leaving China as the country\u2019s biggest trading partner. By contrast, South Korea is Asia\u2019s fourth-largest economy, with a GDP per capita on par with European nations like France and Italy. Its soft power has boomed as cultural exports like music, food and beauty products gained popularity around the world. That\u2019s why North Korea is so wary of allowing any foreign influence such as South Korean slang, said Lankov \u2013 because it means \u201cacknowledging that the alternative model of society worked, and the North Korea model did not.\u201d North Koreans who adopt South Korean mannerisms \u2013 fashion, hairstyles, vocabulary \u2013 thus indicate two things, Lankov added: access to banned materials, and \u201can indication of admiration and sympathy\u201d toward South Korea.\u201d Why North Korea wants nothing to do with South Korea The potency of this soft power relies upon the vast inequity between the countries. People are dying of hunger in North Korea, where supply shortages mean the prices of some staple food items are skyrocketing. Kim has acknowledged the \u201ctense food situation,\u201d though he blamed it on a series of typhoons and floods. It\u2019s not necessarily that North Korean leaders fear a mass uprising from a disgruntled public, said Lankov \u2013 the regime is \u201cbrutal\u201d enough to punish \u201ceverybody who will dare to open his or her mouth.\u201d But rising knowledge about the outside world, and about just how much worse things are in North Korea, could erode the regime\u2019s legitimacy and its entire ideological framework \u2013 similar to how the clamor for Western goods in 1980s Soviet Russia contributed to public disillusionment and its eventual fall. \u201cIt absolutely does pose a threat if young North Koreans are watching South Korean dramas and seeing what life is like for Koreans outside their country, because they\u2019re seeing images of Seoul, of how well they\u2019re living, how freely they\u2019re living,\u201d said Jean Lee, senior fellow at the US-based Wilson Center and the former Pyongyang bureau chief for the Associated Press. And young people are the biggest target of the crackdown because they\u2019re \u201cthe most vulnerable to new influences,\u201d Lankov said. \u201cOlder people don\u2019t want change \u2026 But all the new ideas are spreading among the younger generation.\u201d Talks between the North and South have started and stalled numerous times over the years \u2013 and North Korea\u2019s attitude toward foreign pop culture appears to have relaxed and hardened accordingly. After Kim assumed power in 2011, he initially favored a more liberal approach, said Lankov \u2013 even allowing some Western music, and forming an all-girl North Korean band. Lee, who was based in the capital Pyongyang during those early years, said foreign influences became apparent as the rules relaxed. North Koreans would casually drop South Korean slang as a \u201csly way to hint that they were watching South Korean dramas,\u201d she said. Tourist attractions began to adopt English signage. Elite North Koreans were allowed to travel more, primarily to China. But Kim soon adopted a more conservative approach, and began cracking down on USBs and other technology that could be used to smuggle in information, said Lankov. Tensions escalated in 2016 and 2017 with a series of North Korean missile launches. But relations began thawing after South Korean President Moon Jae-in took office \u2013 by the end of 2018, Moon and Kim had vowed to formally end the Korean War and work toward complete denuclearization. That same month, Kim and his wife attended a rare concert of South Korean singers and performers in Pyongyang \u2013 the first time in more than a decade that South Korean musicians had traveled to North Korea. The same switch happens in the South too, Lee said, where North Korean products and culture become \u201ctrendy\u201d during times of diplomacy, and taboo when tensions rise. \u201cIt\u2019s the political climate that affects pop culture,\u201d she added. But talks faltered in 2019 after a summit between Kim and US President Donald Trump fell apart, and communication ultimately broke down. By early 2020, the country completely shut its borders due to Covid-19, cutting off nearly all trade with China, its main economic lifeline. The state of North Korea\u2019s economy often dictates its restrictions. And with the country in increasingly dire straits, the regime isn\u2019t taking any risks. In December, North Korea passed a new law to prevent the spread of content not approved by government censors; this February, Kim suggested greater controls on societal content could be coming; the following month, a North Korean propaganda website accused K-pop record labels of \u201cslave-like exploitation.\u201d North Korea blasts K-pop industry as 'slave-like exploitation' amid crackdown on foreign media It\u2019s impossible to say for sure what triggered Kim\u2019s latest crackdown on foreign influence in the past two to three years, said Lee \u2013 but she added it could be linked to the border closures and extreme economic hardship. \u201cGoods and people are not going across the border, so they can\u2019t get the things that they want or crave, she said. \u201cSo what we know from this edict that was passed down is that they\u2019re telling their people, stop craving that stuff. And (they\u2019re) phrasing it in a way that\u2019s about North Korean identity \u2013 let\u2019s get back to our tradition, our language, who we are, and not be so covetous of foreign things.\u201d But, she added, things can change quickly depending on the state of inter-Korea diplomacy. \u201cThe party is constantly changing the rules about what\u2019s acceptable when it comes to foreign content, and the people have to pay attention,\u201d she said. And the message now is: \u201cThere may have been a period where it was okay to covet these things, to crave these foreign goods. But it\u2019s no longer okay.\u201d \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network.
