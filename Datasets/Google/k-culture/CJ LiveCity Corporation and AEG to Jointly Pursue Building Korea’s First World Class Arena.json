CJ LiveCity will include the Seoul Metropolitan Arena, as well as a \n      studio complex, a K-culture themed entertainment district and waterfront \n      park. With more than 20 million visitors projected annually, CJ LiveCity \n      will become Korea\u2019s landmark touristic destination that will revitalize \n      both the national economy and the northern Gyeonggi Province. CJ \n      LiveCity is strategically located to attract K culture fans across Asia. \n      The site is centrally positioned among five of Korea\u2019s largest cities \n      with a combined population of over 150 million people. The GTX highspeed \n      express train (scheduled to open in 2023) will connect CJ LiveCity to \n      Gangnam District in only 20 minutes; a 40-minute drive from Seoul\u2019s \n      Incheon International Airport; and a 20-minute drive from Gimpo \n      International Airport. Seoul Metropolitan Arena will be designed by a world-renowned \n      architectural firm and will serve as the key landmark facility in CJ \n      LiveCity. The arena will become Korea\u2019s largest and most advanced live \n      performance venue for K-Pop, international artist tours, sports events \n      and Hallyu content, and is poised to redefine the live entertainment \n      experience in the country. The arena and CJ LiveCity will be the first \n      of their kind destinations in Korea and will offer an \u2018indoor and \n      outdoor\u2019 experience so that audiences in the arena and visitors to CJ \n      LiveCity are able to collectively enjoy the performance together. The agreement marks AEG\u2019s entrance into the growing Korean live \n      entertainment market and further expands the company\u2019s footprint in Asia. Once the arena opens, AEG will curate a top-quality program of \n      international and domestic concert tours through its music division AEG \n      Presents, one of the largest music companies in the world. AEG Presents \n      has promoted world tours for artists including Ed Sheeran, Justin \n      Bieber, Paul McCartney, Elton John, Shawn Mendes, Celine Dion, Khalid, \n      Taylor Swift, The Rolling Stones and Katy Perry. CJ LiveCity\u2019s CEO Michael Kim said, \u201cThis collaboration combines CJ\u2019s \n      long-standing cultural business capabilities with AEG\u2019s venue \n      development and operations expertise and its global live touring and \n      promotions capacities. Seoul Metropolitan Arena, which will be designed \n      by a leading architectural firm, is expected to be a competitive venue \n      not only across Asia, but also globally due to performances of K-Pop as \n      well as world-renowned artists.\u201d Michael Kim continued, \u201cSecuring qualified content based on building a \n      world-class facility is a key success factor for the Arena in CJ \n      LiveCity. In this context, the collaboration with AEG, which is one of \n      the world\u2019s leading venue operators and global live music companies, \n      will be one of the most important factors for the arena\u2019s success.\u201d AEG owns and has developed such renowned venues and entertainment \n      districts as STAPLES Center and L.A. LIVE in Los Angeles, which is \n      visited by more than 20 million guests annually; The O2 in London, which \n      has hosted more than 50 million people since it opened; Mercedes-Benz \n      Arena and Mercedes Platz in Berlin; and T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas \n      through a joint venture partnership with MGM Resorts International. \n      These world-class destinations are among AEG\u2019s global network of over \n      150 venues, which includes more than 20 of the top-100 arenas. AEG also developed China\u2019s premier entertainment destination Mercedes \n      Benz Arena in Shanghai in partnership with the NBA and Oriental Pearl \n      Group, and is currently developing two venues in Bangkok through a joint \n      venture partnership with Thailand\u2019s leading retail developer, The Mall \n      Group.
