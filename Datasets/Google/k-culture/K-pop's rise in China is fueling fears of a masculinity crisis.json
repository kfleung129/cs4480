    "text": "K-pop is an international sensation, the great South Korean musical export that has taken the world by storm. The genre is so popular that fans in Algeria now incorporate a bit of Korean into their Berber and Arabic, and fans in the US travel from around the country to attend Korean cultural conventions called KCONs. In April, the K-pop band BTS, which has an \u201carmy\u201d of devoted fans worldwide, sold more than 3 million copies of its eighth album before it was even released, and the video for the album\u2019s first single broke the record for the most YouTube streams in the 24 hours after release, with 74.6 million listens (surpassing Ariana Grande\u2019s \u201cThank U, Next\u201d). But not everyone is thrilled about the rise of K-pop in general or BTS specifically. In China, where fans of BTS abound, some fear that the stylish boy band, whose seven members dye their hair, wear couture, have earrings, and use makeup, is sending the wrong message about masculinity. According to the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the Chinese state-run media condemns the young idols and their colleagues in other popular bands, calling them \u201csissy pants\u201d and\u00a0warning that a \u201csick\u201d and \u201cdecadent\u201d culture threatens the nation\u2019s future. The fear isn\u2019t confined to state-run media. In Beijing, a former schoolteacher who sees a country in the throes of a \u201cmasculinity crisis\u201d founded the Real Man Training Club to turn teenage boys into \u201calpha males\u201d with athletic activities and macho indoctrination. Of K-pop stars, Tang told the SCMP, \u201cIf you are promoting these effeminate figures, it\u2019s a calamity for our country.\u201d To counter that effect, Tang\u2019s trainees exercise outdoors early in the morning. They wear headbands with the words \u201cReal Man\u201d and t-shirts with slogans in English, like \u201cPower Leader.\u201d One mother told SCMP she signed her son up for the bootcamp because \u201cI think it\u2019s a good opportunity for him to gradually cultivate a macho character. If you are a male, you are supposed to have those male traits.\u201d Like Tang, she too is concerned about the state of Chinese culture, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think the entertainment industry has shown good role models for society because the celebrities \u2026 exhibit a more feminine side of men. That\u2019s the problem.\u201d But the critics are probably not going to stem the tide of stylish boy bands, just as conservative parents have failed in the past to stop racy pop sensations. In the 1950s in the US, when Elvis Presley was becoming a national star, many were scandalized by the rock \u2018n roller\u2019s style. Elvis appeared on The Milton Berle Show\u00a0in 1956 to sing \u201cHound Dog,\u201d and his intense pelvis-shaking alternately thrilled and terrified the nation. Television critics called the performance vulgar and animalistic, and the American Catholic Church wrote an article in its publication headlined \u201cBeware Elvis Presley,\u201d warning that his popularity would lead to juvenile delinquency and a shifting morality. Now, of course, Elvis seems tame, just as BTS and the other K-pop bands made up of stylish crooners with moves will surely seem quaint someday.
