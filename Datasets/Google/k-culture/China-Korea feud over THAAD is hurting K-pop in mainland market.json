Since October, not one K-pop artist has been granted approval to  perform in the world's No. 2 economy, according to reports in  Korean and Chinese media over the past week. The Korea Times and  Yonhap News suggested on Tuesday that the snub was a sign of  intensified anti-Korea sentiment on the mainland. China has been one of the top consumers of hallyu, or Korean pop  culture, but a recent policy move by South Korean President Park  Geun-hye looks set to change that. In July, Seoul agreed to host a Terminal High Altitude Area  Defense system (THAAD)\u2014advanced American missile defense  technology\u2014to better defend itself against North Korea's  constant military threats. Beijing has long voiced opposition to  THAAD, saying its deployment on the Korean Peninsula threatened  Chinese national security interests. In retaliation to the July decision, China banned the airing of  Korean television content, media widely reported in August. At  the time, sources at TV stations in Guangdong told the South  China Morning Post that new approvals for programs featuring  Korean stars would not be granted in the near future. Yonhap News reported on Tuesday that coverage of Korean  celebrities and reviews of Korean films have virtually  disappeared from mainland media, adding that a Chinese company  was fined $14,500 for trying to push a K-pop performance without  gaining government approval. Beijing has yet to confirm the K-pop freeze however. At a press  conference on Monday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Geng  Shuang said he had not heard about any television restrictions  regarding Korean pop stars and did not mention the apparent ban  on performances. \"The Chinese side is always positive to people-to-people and  cultural exchanges with the Republic of Korea,\" Geng said.  \"However, I believe you can all understand that such kind of  exchanges should be based on public support. China's steadfast  opposition to the deployment of THAAD is well known to  all...Relevant parties must have taken note of that.\" As Geng alluded, Chinese users on Weibo seemed largely supportive  of the apparent ban. \"Well done, I'm supportive. No matter how much we like you, you  will become our enemy once you stand in opposition to China.  Sorry,\" FYQ posted. A user called Joonyoung wrote, \"Although I used to like Korean  dramas and stars, I support this decision.\" \"We should ban Hong Kong and Taiwan stars as well,\" Gaga wrote. \u2014Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.
