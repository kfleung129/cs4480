The Mid-Autumn Festival, also known as the Moon Festival, is a traditional Chinese celebration of the fall harvest during a full moon. The festival\u2019s origins can be traced back to the Shang dynasty over 3,000 years ago. \u201cThis event is like Thanksgiving, but in China,\u201d Mary Abounabhan, senior in business management, said. Yixuan Sun, senior in mass communications and member of the Chinese Students and Scholars Union, said the Mid-Autumn Festival is the reunion of family for Chinese people.

Read Now Kendall Borthwick, Manhattan resident, said he found the Mid-Autumn Festival to be an educational and fun experience. \u201cBefore we were married, my wife spent four years in China,\u201d Borthwick said. \u201cThis is a way for me to learn more about the culture she loves.\u201d Attendees at the Mid-Autumn Festival could play traditional Chinese games, with the winners receiving prizes. \u201cThe prize I want is the fan,\u201d Borthwick said. With each game win, attendees were awarded a stamp. The more stamps collected, the higher the chance participants would win the grand prize, a giant folding fan, in the lottery drawing. Attendees also learned how to write their name in traditional Chinese characters. \u201cLearning how to draw my name was interesting,\u201d Borthwick said. \u201cThere\u2019s over 20,000 characters in the Chinese language, so learning mine was good to know because it\u2019s mine.\u201d The festival\u2019s mooncakes \u2014  traditional Chinese baked desserts usually eaten during the Mid-Autumn Festival \u2014 were popular with hungry attendees. Participants could make their own mooncakes with provided flour and stuffing. Ray Luo, teaching assistant of geography, said this was a good inclusion. \u201cMaking my mooncake was my favorite thing to do,\u201d Luo said. \u201cMy home is in China, so I\u2019m far away. I\u2019m glad this event provides an opportunity for me to celebrate.\u201d Xyza Asuncion, graduate student in biological and agricultural engineering, said the Mid-Autumn Festival was very inviting. \u201cThe atmosphere is like a warm blanket,\u201d Asuncion said. \u201cSince it\u2019s all Chinese, I feel very accepted. It is inviting and intriguing.\u201d The Chinese Students and Scholars Union encourages all Chinese students to join the organization and help with future events like the Mid-Autumn Festival. \u201cIt\u2019s a close-knit community and provides a sense of belonging,\u201d Sun said.
