    "text": "Sections Its large pit and fleshy deliciousness are all a result of its status as an evolutionary anachronism K. Annabelle Smith The avocado is a fruit of a different time. The plant hit its evolutionary prime during the beginning of the Cenozoic era when megafauna, including mammoths, horses, gomphotheres and\u00a0giant ground sloths (some of them weighing more than a UPS truck)\u00a0roamed across North America, from Oregon to the panhandle of Florida. The fruit attracted these very large animals (megafauna by definition weigh at least\u00a0100 pounds) that would then eat it whole, travel far distances and defecate, leaving the seed to grow in a new place. That\u2019s the goal of all botanical fruits, really. Survival and growth via seed dispersal. But the great mammals disappeared forever about 13,000 years ago in the Western Hemisphere. Around that time, North America lost 68 percent of its diverse Pleistocene megafauna, and South America lost 80 percent, Connie Barlow, author of The Ghosts of Evolution: Nonsensical Fruit, Missing Partners, And Other Ecological Anachronisms says. But even after this major shift in the land mammal population, the wild avocado still requires the same method of seed dispersal, which makes it somewhat of an evolutionary anachronism. \u201cAfter 13,000 years, the avocado is clueless that the great mammals are gone,\u201d Barlow explains. \u201cWithout larger mammals like the ground sloth to carry the seed far distances, the avocado seeds would rot where they\u2019ve fallen and must compete with the parent tree for light and growth.\u201d A fruit with smaller seeds, like a berry, for example, can be consumed whole and dispersed by small mammals, making the chances of fruiting in a new place higher. After the giant mammals had died out, if an avocado tree was lucky, a jaguar might\u2019ve found the fruit attractive\u2014the cat\u2019s stomach is designed for digesting large hunks of meat, leaving potential for swallowing the avocado whole, though there is no evidence to support this idea. Rodents like squirrels and mice may have also contributed, as they traveled and buried seeds in the ground, rather than letting it rot on the surface. Wild avocados were appealing to larger animals because it had enough tasty flesh to lure them in and could be eaten in one bite. The fruit\u00a0had a larger pit and less flesh than today\u2019s avocados, but it really served as a quick snack for big mammals like the mammoth.\u00a0Barlow writes in \u201cHaunting the Wild Avocado,\u201d originally published in\u00a0Biodversity: The identities of the dispersers shifted every few million years, but from an avocado\u2019s perspective, a big mouth is a big mouth and a friendly gut is a friendly gut.\u00a0The passage of a trifling 13,000 years (since the Pleistocene extinction) is too soon to exhaust the patience of genus Persea. The genes that shape fruits ideal for megafauna retain a powerful memory of an extraordinary mutualistic relationship. How the avocado still exists in the wild after surviving its evolutionary failures remains a puzzle. But once\u00a0Homo sapiens evolved to the point where it could cultivate the species, the fruit had the chance to thrive anew. Back when the giant beasts roamed the earth, the avocado would\u2019ve been a large seed with a small fleshy area\u2014less attractive to smaller mammals such as ourselves. Through cultivation, humans have bulked up avocados so there is more flesh for us to eat. The avocado has been a staple food in Mexico, as well as Central and South America, since 500 B.C. Spanish conquistadors discovered the fruit from the Aztecs in the 16th century, but the ahuacate, the Aztec word for \u201cavocado,\u201d wasn\u2019t grown commercially in the United States until the turn of the 20th century. By 1914, the exotic fruit made an appearance on California soil. Roughly 90 percent of today\u2019s avocados are grown in California according to NPR. But Barlow is quick to point out the difference between a cultivated avocado and those found naturally. \u201cThe wild varieties of avocados that are still somewhat available have a thin fleshy area around the seed\u2014it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be something that we would recognize as edible,\u201d says Barlow. \u201cWhen we go to the store and we see an avocado on sale, it\u2019s always a question of will this be one with a tiny seed, or will it be a batch where the seed takes up five-sixths of the space of the fruit?\u201d Ecologist Dan Janzen conducted groundbreaking research on these and other \u201canachronistic fruits\u201d and found that the avocado isn\u2019t alone in this regard. His\u00a0research in the late \u201970s in the neotropics\u2014\u00a0an ecozone that includes both Americas and the entire South American temperate zone\u2014sparked a shift in ecological thinking regarding these evolutionary-stunted fruits.\u00a0Other examples include: papaya, cherimoya, sapote and countless other fleshy fruits of the neotropics. Another surprising \u201cghost\u201d you may see everyday: Honey locust\u00a0pods scattered about your driveway. All of these fruits are not considered edible by most native mammalian standards today.\u00a0Barlow continues: \u201cIn 1977, however, was beginning to suspect that he\u2014along with every other ecologist working with large tropical fruits of the New World\u2014had been wrong in one very big way. They all had failed to see that some fruits are adapted primarily for animals that have been extinct for 13,000 years.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t have the liver or the enzyme systems to detoxify our bodies from something like the avocado seed,\u201d Barlow says. \u201cBut at the same time, the rhino which has been around for ages, can eat all kinds of things that are toxic to everyone else.\u201d A South American folk recipe for rat poison mixes avocado pits with cheese or lard to kill off unwanted rodents. Whether or not humans are supposed\u00a0to eat avocados from an evolutionary standpoint, America produced\u00a0226,450 tons of the fruit and consumed\u00a04.5 pounds per capita in 2011. The avocado, a true \u201cghost of evolution,\u201d lives on. More avocado facts to drop at your next party: Get the latest Travel & Culture stories in your inbox. K.
