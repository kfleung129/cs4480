As K-pop\u2019s popularity surged at home and abroad in past years, a unique fan culture of buying luxurious gifts for favored stars took root. The culture, however, is now evolving into helping society, rather than just the stars. Not so long ago, it was traditionally the norm for K-pop fans to shower stars with expensive gifts, but the trend is often frowned upon when it goes to the extreme. Avid fans of K-pop boy band Super Junior, for example, were not afraid to spend $100,000 on the idol group\u2019s albums to help the group win the top prize at the Golden Disk Awards back in 2011. Some viewed the move as \u201cunfair\u201d, saying the hoarding manipulated the Awards results. This gift-giving culture started simply with fans handing over small presents to express their love for idols. But then it turned into a fierce competition among fans, who competitively bought pricey gifts, hoping to catch the eye of their stars. It made idol stars uncomfortable, as did many fans who were pushed into spending large sums of money to prove their love and loyalty. This trend, however, has seen a shift in recent years. Fans are now collecting money to donate in the name of their favorite stars instead. Some donate to create a forest or make donations to the underprivileged. \u201cSunny Forest\u201d was built by fans of Sunny, a member of Girls\u2019 Generation, for her birthday last month, following a slew of forests named after EXO, Rain, Lee\u00a0Hyori, Super Junior, INFINITE,\u00a0SHINee\u00a0and other K-pop stars. Fans of K-pop idol group EXO-M\u2019s\u00a0Xiumin\u00a0donated about $9,800 to a local charity in his name to help Ethiopian children access clean water and education, to celebrate his 24th birthday. \u201cThese days, a new culture has emerged where fans donate money to charities on their favorite stars\u2019 birthdays, and a growing number of fans are following the trend,\u201d said a showbiz insider. It doesn\u2019t end there. Fans are now impressing stars by sending rather practical gifts that can be used and shared with fellow stars and teams. Fans of K-pop star\u00a0Jaejoong\u00a0from Korea and Japan showed their support for him by giving a large-scale gift to the team working on the MBC-TV drama \u201cTriangle\u201d, in which the singer is starring. The fans allegedly sent jumpers from Black Yak, socks, toothbrushes, snacks and prepared a barbeque buffet for some 180 crew members. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.
