    "text": "The U.S. government has escalated its trade war with China by restricting exports of U.S. semiconductor production equipment to a Chinese state-backed chipmaker. According to wire reports, the U.S. Department of Commerce said on Oct. 30 that it had put Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co. (JHICC) on a list of entities that cannot purchase components, software and technology good from U.S. firms. The action was taken as the U.S. administration is concerned about the risks that the Chinese company could pose to U.S. security when it is allowed to import semiconductor equipment from U.S. firms. JHICC is one of the new Chinese chipmakers that have\u00a0been preparing mass production of memory chips. If the company floods the market with cheap products, the Commerce Department\u2019s logic goes, it could threaten the survival of U.S. chipmakers, which supply their products to the U.S. military. If U.S. chipmakers go out of business and cannot supply their products to the U.S. military, U.S. national security will be threatened. It is unclear how the U.S. government\u2019s latest action will affect the Chinese chipmaker. Some Korean analysts say that JHICC will not be able to produce chips as planned if it cannot acquire U.S. equipment. The company was expected to start mass production next year. Reuters quoted Linley Gwennap, a chip expert and president of the Linley Group, as saying, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much impossible to build a leading-edge fab (semiconductor plant) without buying equipment from American companies.\u201d Gwennap said suppliers such as Applied Materials Inc., Lam Research Corp. and KLA-Tencor Corp. were likely supplying equipment to Fujian Jinhua. Korean analysts say the U.S. action will benefit Korea\u2019s two chipmakers, Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix. The stock price of Samsung Electronics gained 2.29% to close at 42,350 won on Oct. 30. SK Hynix also earned 2.10% to finish at 68,200 won. The U.S. move is certain to escalate the ongoing trade dispute between the two superpowers. Reuters reported that the action \u201cis likely to ignite new tensions between Beijing and Washington since the JHICC is at the heart of the \u2018Made in China 2025\u2019 program to develop new high-technology industries.\u201d According to the Reuters report, Micron, a U.S. memory chip producer with factories in Virginia and Utah, has accused JHICC and Taiwanese partner United Microelectronics Corp of stealing its chip designs in a lawsuit in California. In turn, the companies countersued Micron in China, where courts sided with them and banned some of Micron\u2019s chips in China. \u201cWhen a foreign company engages in activity contrary to our national security interests, we will take strong action to protect our national security,\u201d Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement.
