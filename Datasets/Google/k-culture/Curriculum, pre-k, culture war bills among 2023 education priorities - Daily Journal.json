    "text": "The Indiana State House in Indianapolis, Indiana Changes to K-12 curriculum, increased access to early childhood education and a response to Indiana\u2019s ongoing teacher shortage are top-of-mind for Indiana lawmakers as the 2023 legislative session nears. Republican state lawmakers have also hinted at the return of a contentious \u201ccurriculum transparency\u201d bill that would limit classroom discussions about race, as well as a bill that seeks to prohibit sexually-explicit content in school library books. Versions of both bills sparked widespread debate during the 2022 session, but both failed to pass. Top GOP legislators are additionally pointing to a draft \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d that could ban Indiana teachers from holding classroom instruction about sexual orientation or gender identity. It\u2019s not exactly clear where Gov. Eric Holcomb stands on such proposals, although he told the Indiana Capital Chronicle he would entertain a variety of bills in the next session \u2014 and that while he wants to \u201cbe very pragmatic\u201d about what bills he signs, he did not say whether any would be too hot to touch. The Republican governor is expected to outline his full legislative agenda for the next session on Jan. 4 \u2014 less than a week before Indiana lawmakers reconvene at the statehouse. The 2023 session will also draw debate around the next state budget \u2014 a majority of which goes towards education-related line items. Numerous other agenda items affecting Hoosier students and schools will be up for debate, too. \u201cReinventing\u201d high school Republican House Speaker Todd Huston in November announced a desire to \u201creinvent\u201d high school in Indiana during the upcoming legislative session. Since then, other GOP leaders and state education department officials have echoed the same idea. Longtime chairman of the House Education Committee, Rep. Bob Behning, R-Indianapolis, said the state\u2019s high school curriculum needs to better prepare students to enter the workforce and should include greater emphasis on the importance of post-secondary education. Part of that could include making math \u201cmore relevant\u201d by tying components like financial literacy, simple interest and mortgage rates into coursework, he said. Other options include more apprenticeship programs \u2014 and making those types of opportunities more easily count towards a student\u2019s diploma requirements. Indiana Secretary of Education Katie Jenner has also doubled-down on the importance of adding additional work-based learning opportunities for students and making it easier for high schoolers to access post-secondary education credentials before graduation. \u201cIn the four years we have children in high school, how do we really maximize that time, so they\u2019re set up for the best possible success?\u201d Jenner said. The Indiana Chamber of Commerce continues to make the same argument. Sen. J.D. Ford, D-Indianapolis, said Democratic lawmakers will renew their call to automatically enroll qualified students into the 21st Century Scholars program, a statewide grant program that supports student enrollment at two- and four-year schools. Enrollment in the program varies across the state, with some schools reporting 80% of qualified students are already enrolled, while others have less than 8% signed up, according to the Indiana Department of Education\u2019s new GPS dashboard. The Indiana Commission for Higher Education made automatic enrollment a legislative priority for the next session, too. Senate education committee chair Sen. Jeff Raatz, R-Richmond, said he supports the idea if the current requirements \u2014 such as maintaining good grades while in high school \u2014 stay in place. \u201cI think it\u2019s incredibly important as we develop these young people to become young adults, to realize that they have things they have to do in order to make it to the next level in their lives,\u201d he said. Early childhood education Ford emphasized the need for Indiana to expand resources centered around early childhood education. The ranking Democratic lawmaker said the issue is top-of-list for other members of the party, too. \u201cIf we want our students reading at that third grade level \u2026 if we want to see positive graduation rates, it all starts with pre-K,\u201d he said during a recent legislative conference, referring to the state\u2019s dismal literacy rates reported earlier this year. He said early education has become an urgent issue after last year\u2019s IREAD scores showed roughly one in five Hoosier third graders can\u2019t read proficiently. In response, Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis, said he plans to introduce a bill to expand the income eligibility for On My Way Pre-K, a state program providing pre-K grants to low-income families of four-year-olds. Jenner noted that learning Indiana\u2019s learning gaps \u201cstart so early,\u201d adding \u201cit\u2019s imperative that we have excellent, excellent early learning in Indiana. \u201cI think that if we really want to scale access to early learning, we have to get bureaucracy out of the way as much as possible,\u201d she said. Behning maintained that his caucus \u201chas been a strong champion for pre-k,\u201d and said pricing for early learning \u201cprobably needs to be adjusted.\u201d The lawmaker also shifted some of the pre-k investment responsibility to the \u201cemployer community.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a great asset for them \u2014 it\u2019s a retention tool,\u201d Behning said. \u201cWe could provide credits or some sort of incentive for them to invest \u2026 and it makes us conscious of state dollars.\u201d Raatz, on the other hand, said he would like to see On My Way Pre-K run by the Indiana Department of Education rather than the Family and Social Services Administration. Responding to teacher shortage The Indiana State Teachers Association (ISTA), the largest teachers union in the state, announced this month that its top agenda item is addressing the state\u2019s teacher shortage, including through improved pay and benefits. \u201cThe educator shortage crisis is real \u2026 and the shortage has become unsustainable,\u201d said ISTA president Keith Gambill during a news conference earlier this month. He noted there are currently about 1,500 educator job openings in Indiana, affecting over 35,000 Hoosier students. There are over 2,800 jobs available in Indiana schools overall, according to the Indiana Department of Education School Personnel Job Bank. \u201cIf that isn\u2019t compelling enough for legislators to recognize they have to do better in increasing the pay and doing what is needed to make sure that we are able to fully staff our schools, then I don\u2019t know what that would take to convince them,\u201d Gambill continued, adding that lawmakers should simultaneously focus on other school staff like food service providers and bus drivers. \u201cWe cannot rely on short term fixes,\u201d he said. ISTA\u2019s proposed four-step plan of action for legislators emphasizes the need for educators to earn more pay. Gambill said legislators also need to improve working conditions for both teachers and students, respect educators\u2019 voices \u2014 including expanded collective bargaining rights \u2014 and \u201cinspiring and preparing\u201d the next generation of educators. \u201cDivisive concepts\u201d bills could make a comeback Indiana Democrats and teachers union representatives have pleaded for Republicans to ditch divisive \u201cculture war\u201d bills that prompted protests and heated debate throughout the previous legislative session. Despite this, Behning said he \u201cguaranteed\u201d such bills would still be introduced. Raatz said such bills could be entertained in his chamber, as well. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we\u2019re going to see them, and I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re not going to see them,\u201d Raatz said. \u201cBut at this stage of the game, the culture war should not be proliferated in the classroom \u2026 we need to educate. We need the basics.\u201d Behning said lawmakers in both the House and Senate will introduce measures that seek to combine language from two previous contentious bills \u2014 one that sought to ban \u201ccritical race theory\u201d from being taught in classrooms, and another which aimed to remove \u201csexually-explicit\u201d materials from school libraries. GOP lawmakers said earlier this month that they will also attempt to enact a controversial bill to restrict discussion of LGBTQ+ subjects in schools. Behning said during a legislative conference in Indianapolis that the upcoming draft would be \u201csimilar to what Florida did in regards to sexual orientation.\u201d The \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d law Behning referred to was signed into law by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has been described as one of the most \u201chateful\u201d pieces of legislation in the country. Behning did not explicitly name the bill\u2019s sponsors and clarified that he did not yet know whether it would be assigned to his committee. But he did express support for \u201cparental rights\u201d in education. \u201cLet\u2019s teach kids the basics and not try to get beyond that in terms of what are parental responsibilities versus what are responsibilities of the school,\u201d Behning said. Ford said the state has \u201cmore important priorities to deal with,\u201d however. \u201cWe will definitely be playing defense if we have to,\u201d Ford said. \u201cThose divisive concepts, in my opinion, always serve to divide us, and so I\u2019m hoping that next session will be more about investing in our kids.\u201d This story by Casey Smith is republished from indianacapitalchronicle.com, an independent, not-for-profit news organization that covers state government, policy and elections.
