    "text": "By De Elizabeth A new K-pop group is facing online backlash after dropping their debut music video last week. According to Mashable, EXP Edition consists of four guys from the United States who moved to South Korea in order to learn the language and produce their music. And while the members \u2013 Koki Tomlinson, Frankie DaPonte, Hunter Kohl, and \u0160ime Ko\u0161ta \u2013 come from a variety of backgrounds, none of them are Korean. In the comments of their YouTube video, \"Feel Like This,\" some critics have pointed out that many K-pop groups train for years in order to prepare for their musical debut. However, as Mashable notes, EXP Edition began as a college project by a Korean artist named Bora Kim while she was attending Columbia University in New York. Kim aimed to document the making of a boy band, explaining: \"I was interested in researching the phenomenon of the Korean Wave, and the commercial success of K-pop especially, on a global scale.... I wanted to see what would happen if I made American boys into K-pop performers, by teaching them how to sing in Korean and act like Korean boys, and complicate this flow/appropriation even more, since I\u2019m in New York, where so many talents are just one online recruitment ad away.\" That said, EXP Edition's origin hasn't exempted them from scrutiny from fans who think they are appropriating Korean culture. One YouTube commenter wrote, \"We don\u2019t need mediocre white boys trying to be idols in Korea when they are able to become successful in literally any other part of the world.\" However, some other commenters are supportive, wishing the group luck as they make their debut in the K-pop world.
