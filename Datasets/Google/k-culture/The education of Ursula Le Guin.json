View all partners On Jan. 22, Ursula K. Le Guin died in Portland, Oregon. Since then, much has been written memorializing her genre-defying body of work, her contributions to feminism and science fiction, and her broad interest in human society and government. But as a cultural anthropologist, I\u2019ve always been interested in the relationship between Le Guin and her father, anthropologist Alfred Louis Kroeber. Kroeber\u2019s ideas \u2013 which had a profound influence on his daughter\u2019s writing \u2013 stemmed from an important development in the discipline of anthropology, one that viewed human culture as something that wasn\u2019t ingrained, and had to be taught and learned. Kroeber\u2019s mentor was a Columbia University anthropologist named Franz Boas. Kroeber was especially drawn to Boas\u2019 newly developed notion of culture and the broader theory of \u201ccultural relativism.\u201d Cultural relativism emerged in the late 19th century as an alternative to theories like social Darwinism that linked culture to evolution. These theories \u2013 widely accepted at the time \u2013 tended to rank human societies on an evolutionary scale. Not surprisingly, Western European civilizations were seen as the pinnacle of culture. But Boas proposed something radically different. He insisted, based on field-based research, that humans live in stunningly diverse cultural worlds shaped by language, which creates institutions, aesthetics, and ideas and notions of right and wrong. He further argued that each society needs to reproduce its culture through teaching and learning. Kroeber described culture as \u201csuperorganic.\u201d According to this idea, the \u201ccivilizational achievements\u201d of any group of people weren\u2019t passed down biologically and could only be taught. If we\u2019re deprived of our access to human instruction \u2013 books, guides, teachers \u2013 we won\u2019t know how to build buildings, write poetry and compose music. Humans, Kroeber knew, are hardwired to create, but there\u2019s no such thing as a \u201chereditary memory\u201d that allows a people to intuitively know how to recreate specific things. He told the hypothetical story of a baby taken from France and brought to China. She would, he argued, grow up speaking perfect Chinese and would know no French. His point \u2013 as obvious as it might seem today \u2013 was that there was no hereditary quality to \u201cFrenchness\u201d that would carry over, genetically, to a child born of French parents. The idea of culture as \u201csuperorganic\u201d says that people are organic lifeforms, like ants or dogs or fish, but culture is \u201cadded\u201d to them, which influences their behaviors. Ants and dogs don\u2019t need culture to reproduce their behaviors: Raised in isolation from their own kind, they still do the things they were programmed to do. Kroeber, along with many of his fellow anthropologists, were drawn to these ideas because they depicted culture as universally human, but not universally rankable, racially predetermined or inherently more or less sophisticated. For example, it was common in the late 19th century for expansionists to justify their imperialist ambitions with \u201cscientific\u201d evidence that Native Americans were culturally inferior. They pointed to language: Native Americans, they claimed, didn\u2019t have words for the passage of time. For this reason, they couldn\u2019t grasp a complex concept like history. But Kroeber and his colleagues pointed out the Hopi did have a complex way of reckoning time. They just didn\u2019t count things, like days or hours, using the same terminology they might use to count men, or rocks or clouds, which are objects you can actually see. To the Hopi, a day is in no way like a rock. So it shouldn\u2019t be treated as such. Kroeber\u2019s peers included African-American anthropologist and folklorist Zora Neale Hurston, Jewish linguist and anthropologist Edward Sapir, and female scholars such as Ruth Benedict and Margaret Mead. All grappled with discrimination and cultural denigration. In response, Kroeber was compelled to write that history, geography and the environment influenced cultural differences. No culture simply emerged naturally. \u201cSocial agencies are so tremendously influential on every one of us,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthat it is very difficult to find any test that, if distinctive racial faculties were inborn, would fairly reveal the degree to which they are inborn.\u201d The only reason, according to Kroeber, that someone would insist on innate  differences between human population would be to preserve the status quo: societies built on racial discrimination and colonialism. Throughout her childhood in Berkeley, California, Ursula Le Guin was exposed to these ideas. They very likely formed the basis of her worldview. Her writing was never simply about creating a magical or strange world. It was about crafting a laboratory to play with identities \u2013 race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality or class \u2013 in a way that forced readers to think about how cultural prejudice colored their views of other people. \u201cEntertaining them is all well and good,\u201d she told New York Times reporter John Wray, \u201cbut does it make them think?\u201d With Le Guin, it always struck me that the point of her imagined universes was precisely to show that nothing human was universal, and that what was \u201calien\u201d was only a matter of perspective. In \u201cThe Left Hand of Darkness,\u201d Le Guin tackled the idea of gender norms. Here, I think she was channeling Margaret Mead\u2019s breakthrough study \u201cSex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies,\u201d in which Mead was able to demonstrate that gender norms can significantly diverge across cultures. In \u201cThe Word for World Is Forest,\u201d Le Guin didn\u2019t simply pen an environmentalist fable about the destruction of a forest and its people. She built off the insights of indigenous scholars like Vine Deloria Jr., who put native peoples\u2019 voices and worldviews at the center of the indigenous rights movement. In \u201cThe Dispossessed,\u201d she contrasts the different political systems of two neighboring worlds not to argue which one is best, per se, but to show that in order for these systems to exist, humans need to actively participate in and reproduce them. In 2015 I planned an anthropology class that I hoped could use speculative fiction and fantasy as a way to understand basic concepts in cultural anthropology. The class was built around Kroeber and Le Guin. A mutual friend gave my syllabus to Le Guin, and she wrote to me. She suggested some other works to include and seemed to appreciate the concept of the course. \u201cI think my pa would be tickled,\u201d she wrote, \u201cthat he and I have ended up on the same [syallabus].\u201d Copyright \u00a9 2010\u20132023, The Conversation ",
