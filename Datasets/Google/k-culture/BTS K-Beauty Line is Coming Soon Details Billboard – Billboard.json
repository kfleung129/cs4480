BTS Reveal \u2018Serendipity\u2019 Comeback Trailer for \u2018Love Yourself: Her\u2019 Album Members Suga and J-Hope already live streamed their entire beauty routine, so this was bound to happen sooner or later. Digital Music News reports the Korean group\u00a0partnered with K-beauty line VT Cosmetics to launch their very own makeup and collection of skincare products. Though exact details of what fans can fully expect has yet to be revealed, Refinery 29 confirms\u00a0BTS\u2019 first drop will include the boys\u2019 exclusive sunscreen. The lotion will feature seven sunscreen cushion compacts, in honor of each singer from the band. Summer may be over, but we guarantee these compacts will still sell out, so keep your eyes open for what\u2019s to come. Other products are also rumored to come out this fall and we can hardly wait to see what creative items they come up with.
