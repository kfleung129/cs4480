Zero K is not easy reading. Don DeLillo\u2019s novels have always tended to be verbal installations as much as they are stories, descriptions of spaces, floatings of ideas, gnomic sayings. Here, in his 16th, published at the age of 80, this static style takes over almost completely. The title refers to absolute zero, minus 273.15 degrees centigrade, for this is a novel about cryonics, the freezing of dead people in the hope that future technologies will allow them to be revived. Part One  of the novel, 154 of its 274 pages, is a protracted description of a vast, mostly underground, cryogenics operation, called the Convergence, located on the borders between Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. The first-person narrator, 34-year-old Jeff, has been flown there by his billionaire father Ross Lockhart, one of the main backers of the project, to witness his terminally ill stepmother, Artis, enter into this suspended animation. Jeff, whose loyalties lie with his own mother, Madeleine, whose deathbed he attended, is sceptical of the entire set-up. Although not a Catholic, he once attended church on Ash Wednesday and had his forehead imprinted by the priest\u2019s thumb: \u201cDust thou art... And to dust thou shalt return.\u201d Nevertheless, he explores the Convergence, cut deep into the rock. One of the place\u2019s features is a screen showing the disasters afflicting the world outside \u2014 floods, fires, wars, terrorism \u2014 a device which allows DeLillo to indulge extensively in his favourite technique of describing apocalyptic imagery at arm\u2019s length (ekphrasis) rather than addressing reality itself. Yet Jeff remains convinced that what he is seeing is no more than \u201ca highly precise medical procedure guided by mass delusion, by superstition and arrogance and self-deception\u201d. He sees the whole endeavour as the final purchase of a man driven and shaped by money. The section ends with the disembodied monologue of Artemis, whose brain continues to stir \u2014 \u201cam I someone or is it just the words themselves that make me think I am someone\u201d \u2014 amounting to little more than a poor pastiche of Beckett. Part two of the novel, much more readable, sees Jeff back in New York, turning down his father\u2019s job offer, describing his changing relationship with a teacher, Emma, who has a strange son adopted from the Ukraine, Stak. They visit an art gallery displaying a single huge natural rock and Jeff quotes Heidegger: \u201cMan alone exists. Rocks are, but they do not exist. Trees are, but they do not exist. Horses are, but they do not exist.\u201d But he returns to the Convergence to see his father voluntarily join Artis in frozen animation and visits the hall in which the dormants are held. \u201cThis was pure spectacle, a single entity, the bodies regal in their cryonic bearing. It was a form of visionary art, it was body art with broad implications,\u201d he observes. But for himself he knows: \u201cI\u2019d never felt more human than I did when my mother lay in bed, dying.\u201d The novel ends in fragmentary observations, closing with an epiphany evidently experienced by DeLillo himself, a moment, once or twice a year, when the sun\u2019s rays align perfectly with the street grid in Manhattan, as if the city were one gigantic henge \u2014 \u201cthe full solar disk, bleeding into the streets...  An intimate touch of Earth and Sun...\u201d Zero K, behind its abstractions and opacities, bafflements and removals, embraces mortality. \u201cOrdinary moments make the life,\u201d one of the novel\u2019s simplest sentences tells us. Zero K is far from an ordinary novel \u2014 though not entirely for its own good.
