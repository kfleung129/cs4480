A Tree. Evening.\u201d These, famously, are the shorthand co\u00f6rdinates for the postapocalyptic, existential terrain of Samuel Beckett\u2019s \u201cWaiting for Godot,\u201d which premi\u00e8red in Paris, in 1953, at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Babylone, under the direction of Roger Blin. In the magazine this week, Hilton Als reviews the director Sean Mathias\u2019s current reprisal, at the Cort Theatre, calling the play \u201ca poem with more clues than exposition.\u201d Many of \u201cGodot\u201d\u00a0\u2019s clues lie in its strict technical specifications, for which Beckett was famous. The stage directions serve the twofold purpose of both unlocking and enhancing the play\u2019s gloomy mystery. In the pastoral opening scene, we meet the play\u2019s main protagonists, Estragon and Vladimir. On a country road, with a lonely, barren tree as their post, the tramps wait idly for the elusive Godot. Soon, the moon rises, and the text suggests a resemblance to Caspar David Friedrich\u2019s painting \u201cTwo Men Contemplating the Moon,\u201d which Beckett hinted to a friend was a visual inspiration for \u201cGodot.\u201d Act II begins with the stage directions \u201cNext Day. Same Time. Same Place.\u201d The tree now has leaves, and Pozzo and Lucky, a master and a slave, respectively, have been struck blind and dumb. Time has passed, yet we have no sense of accumulation. In seeming perpetuity, and perhaps in vain, Estragon and Vladimir continue to wait\u2014and we with them. As the Irish critic Vivian Mercier wrote, \u201cWaiting for Godot\u201d is a play in which \u201cnothing happens, twice.\u201d The aesthetic of \u201cWaiting for Godot\u201d centers on the notion of the lieu vague. The playwright abstracts the scene until it scarcely exists. Beckett\u2019s minimalism has received various design treatments in the past fifty years, both in traditional theatres and more unexpected locations. In 1957, the gallows of the San Quentin prison provided the backdrop for a production organized by an ensemble of inmates. The Youth Theatre in besieged Sarajevo was the setting for Susan Sontag\u2019s candlelit revival, in 1993, and the multimedia artist Paul Chan took a literal approach, in 2007, staging Godot outdoors at dusk, on a road in post-Katrina New Orleans. In such instances, Beckett\u2019s technical specifications are treated according to locality and available resources, exemplifying the play\u2019s everyman, everywhere appeal. Beckett, who oversaw many productions of his play, was unafraid to criticize set designers who he thought failed to capture the over-all look of \u201cGodot\u201d; he particularly disliked the busy design of the first English-language production, directed by Peter Hall, in London, in 1955. He was, however, characteristically reticent on the subject of the play\u2019s setting, and told Roger Blin, \u201cThe only thing I\u2019m sure of is that they\u2019re wearing bowler hats.\u201d In 1961, Beckett turned to the Italian sculptor Alberto Giacometti, his Left Bank drinking companion, for help in the run-up to a forthcoming Paris revival of \u201cGodot.\u201d Designing the tree confounded them both. \u201cWe spent the whole night in the studio with that plaster tree,\u201d Giacometti said, \u201ctrying to make it sparser, smaller, the branches thinner. It never looked any good, and neither he nor I liked it. And we kept saying to each other, Perhaps like this\u00a0\u2026.\u201d In their indecisiveness, Beckett and Giacometti have their dramatic equivalents in Estragon and Vladimir. What motivates Beckett\u2019s protagonists is the pursuit of the Absolute, similar to the two artists\u2019 persistent, deep-rooted doubt that they would ever find the perfect artistic form. A paradigm for the human condition, \u201cGodot\u201d oscillates between the tangible and real and that which remains invisible and unknowable. The set designer\u2019s task is to evoke the enigmatic void of the space between the two. So how is a designer to attempt a contemporary Godot stage set? In the Cort Theatre production, the designer Stephen Brimson Lewis decided against the artifice of \u201ca painted backdrop and fake muddy road.\u201d Instead, Estragon (Ian McKellen) and Vladimir (Patrick Stewart) wait on the stage of a decrepit, deserted theatre, flanked by balconies that are replicas of those at the Cort. The tree\u2014a real one\u2014sprouts out from between wooden planks, and the upstage is the brick wall of the theatre. \u201cA lot of Beckett\u2019s material is instinctive and instinctual,\u201d Lewis told me. \u201cYou don\u2019t over intellectualize it when you\u2019re designing it. You just try to react to it. I didn\u2019t respond to \u2018country,\u2019 but I responded to \u2018a tree,\u2019 to \u2018evening,\u2019 and to everything else.\u201d There is, of course, no definitive imagining of the tree or, indeed, of any of Beckett\u2019s clues. The props are mere representations, nothing more. As Beckett once said, \u201cAll true grace is in the economical.\u201d \u201cGodot\u201d is economical in form and in language, as well as in aesthetic. Yet Beckett\u2019s reductionist approach can only go so far. \u201cYou can\u2019t present a blank canvas,\u201d said Lewis. \u201cEverything that you do as an artist will have a specific quality to it, because you interpret through your taste, your experience, and your way of looking at the world. Then you can ask yourself, \u2018Is that O.K., Mr. Beckett?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Top: The first production of, \u201cGodot,\u201d directed by Roger Blin, who also starred as Pozzo (far right).
