    "text": "Author: Geng Song, UHK Descendants of the Sun, a South Korean TV drama featuring a romance between a soldier and a surgeon in a fictional war-torn nation, is reigniting K-drama fever across Asia. In China alone, where the program is simultaneously broadcast online, it has drawn more than 2.4 billion views on video-streaming website iQIYI since it began airing in late February. Its fandom is mostly composed of young women who are fixated with the handsome male protagonist played by Song Joong-ki. It is reported that a jealous husband in China one night drunkenly stormed into a photography studio and demanded that the shop owner take pictures to \u2018make him look like Song\u2019.\nThe cult of male beauty associated with Descendants of the Sun is reminiscent of a recent trend that has been termed \u2018Pan-East Asian soft masculinity\u2019\u2014male images that are exceptionally feminine to Western eyes. These types of images are mainly produced and circulated by the \u2018Korean Wave\u2019 and Japanese anime, comics and games (ACG) culture. It is well received by youth across most of East Asia and presents a significant response to the globally hegemonic masculine ideal based on the image of the transnational businessman.\nSome claim that the success of South Korean and Japanese pop culture lies in attempts to make it mugukjeok or \u2018culturally odourless\u2019 by downplaying their national specificity. But for many others its popularity can be largely explained by its representations of Pan-East Asian soft masculinity.\nPan-East Asian soft masculinity has its roots in the Confucian tradition of scholar masculinity shared by many East Asian cultures, such as the wen (literary attainment) masculinity in China or seonbi (scholar-officials) masculinity in Korean history. The talented scholar is physically weak, delicate and handsome, with androgynous beauty. He is desirable to women by dint of his knowledge and literary gifts.\nAt the same time, the current popularity of these images of masculine beauty also reflects the influence of the metrosexual trend from the West. This indicates that masculinity has become increasingly pluralistic and hybridised in a rapidly globalising East Asia.\nOne conspicuous example of the transnational flow of male images in East Asia is the spread of otaku culture. With the international spread of anime and manga, the term otaku has entered other cultures and generated new expressions. In Chinese, the vogue word zhainan (the Chinese pronunciation of the Japanese kanji for otaku) refers to a socially awkward young man who secludes himself in his home all day, indulging in computer games, anime and geek culture.\nDespite the Japanese term\u2019s association with antisocial behaviour, more and more young men in Chinese cities identify themselves as zhainan and the term has come to indicate a desirable form of masculinity. There are Web essays on how to woo a zhainan and love stories featuring high school students and their zhainan teacher. The zhai lifestyle has even become a trend among urban youth. The popularity of zhainan in China may be explained by the discourse in premodern Chinese literature on the \u2018purity\u2019 of men who have obsessions.\nCompared with zhainan, the word meng bears an even more direct link with Japanese pop culture, being the Chinese pronunciation of the Japanese character moe. Moe, which originally meant \u2018budding\u2019 or \u2018burning\u2019, now refers to a particular kind of \u2018adorable\u2019 or \u2018cute\u2019 preadolescent girl in ACG culture. Like otaku, the word has undergone transformations in meaning and usage during its migration to China.\nIn the Chinese context, meng, which can be used as a noun, adjective or even a verb, has become a trendy word among young people, particularly in cyberspace. It can be used to describe a wide of range of things: from children\u2019s expressions to President Xi Jinping\u2019s new hairstyle. Notably, it is increasingly used to describe loveliness in men. When a man is referred to as meng, there is a (positive) implication of femininity. The popularity of zhainan and meng in China, on the whole, represents a growing cultural convergence among East Asian countries.\nThe \u2018softness\u2019 of Pan-East Asian soft masculinity also lies in its more sensitive and caring attitude toward women. The \u2018Herbivore Man\u2019 (s\u014dshoku danshi) in Japan and South Korea, and \u2018Warm Man\u2019 (nuan nan) in China are all in line with this type of sensitive new guy.\nThe term Herbivore Man and its counterpart, \u2018Carnivorous Woman,\u2019 were first coined by the Japanese author Maki Fukasawa and became known through Megumi Ushikubo\u2019s popular book The Herbivorous Ladylike Men: A Change in Japan. This new type of man is arguably a rebellion against the ideal salaryman masculinity of postwar Japan. They are less ambitious and are \u2018harmless\u2019 for women because they always display an understanding of women and their feelings.\nThe 2013 Chinese hit film, Finding Mr Right, centres on the idealised Warm Man. The male protagonist played by Wu Xiubo used to be a renowned doctor in Beijing but gives up his career in order to look after his teenage daughter in the United States. In China, he also epitomises the ideal sensitive man who harbours warm emotions for women.\n\u2018Tough\u2019 masculine images are coterminous with \u2018soft\u2019 ones in East Asian popular culture. One example of the former is heroic men in China\u2019s anti-Japanese TV dramas, a popular subgenre of TV program in China. This government-sponsored and market-oriented \u2018consumerist nationalism\u2019 represents a happy marriage between the state\u2019s agenda and popular social desires in Chinese television.\nIn these dramas, patriotic Chinese masculinity is portrayed against its Other, the \u2018Japanese devils\u2019. The characterisation of Japanese officers and soldiers reflects stereotypes that are deeply rooted in the collective memory and imagination of generations of Chinese, gained from popular media if not from actual experience. For instance, the cold-blooded Japanese commander predictably commits hara-kiri when ultimately faced with defeat. The Japanese officer regularly slaps his subordinates in fits of anger, with baka (Japanese for \u2018fool\u2019 or \u2018idiot\u2019) always on his lips. He also regularly mistreats women, while his submissive wife bows deeply to welcome him home every evening.\nIt is against these images of Japanese men that an idealised Chinese manhood is portrayed and eulogised.\nGeng Song is Associate Professor at the University of Hong Kong.\nThis article appeared in the most recent edition of the\u00a0East Asia Forum Quarterly, \u2018Gender and sexuality\u2019.

From a western psychological perspective, Otaku in Japan are more asocial than antisocial.  Ie, they avoid social interactions with others, especially women, because if their extreme shyness, lack of social graces, and lack of empathy for the feelings of others. They generally do not engage in antisocial behavior.  Ie, they do not violate the law and are not typically violent. One can wonder if Asian women nowadays are enamored with these images of sensitive, empathic, \u2018feminine\u2019 men because they find the stereotypical hard boiled, ambitious \u2018masculine\u2019 man to be so disappointing. When I wrote \u2018antisocial\u2019, I had Shoko Asahara and Tsutomu Miyazaki in my mind. But you are right that most Okatu are asocial instead of antisocial. Many thanks for pointing that out, Richard! But all this androgyny you see in Asian men started in Japan; not South Korea. South Korea took these aesethetics from Japan and capitalized on it through the success of Japanese pop culture in the world to make its way into the west. South Korea is not an innovative country when it comes to social movements; instead, it takes what seems fashionable or succesful and it infiltrates. This is the reason why aesthetics of KPOP bands are so reminiscent of anime/manga charcaters which are not Korean pop culture but Japanese pop culture. This is why I think that whenever you want to analyse these matters it must be taking into account the fact that it was Japan that started and created a whole world around \u201csoft masculinity\u201d as you put it while South Korea simply assimilated it for its profitable potetial as a market. A fantastic point! Many thanks, Alex!  July \u2013 September 2023\nFor electronic copies of back issues, links to the individual articles and to subscribe to the hard copies, see the EAFQ page. ",
