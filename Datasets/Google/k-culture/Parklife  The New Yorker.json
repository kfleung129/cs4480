Scott \u201cHoney, I twisted through more damn traffic today,\u201d reads the new white-on-pink mural by Ed Ruscha, above the High Line at Twenty-second Street. On a recent afternoon, the text doubled as a caption for a live-action cartoon, as a man on a scooter wove his way through a gaggle of tourists. Nearby, teen-agers held up handwritten signs advertising free hugs and yelled, \u201cIt\u2019s emotional Tuesday!\u201d Performance art? No, students from the neighborhood\u2019s Fashion Industries high school, blowing off steam. It can be hard to distinguish what\u2019s art and what\u2019s not on the High Line. \u201cArcheo,\u201d a new exhibition of eight outdoor sculptures by seven young artists, organized by the park\u2019s nimble curator, Cecilia Alemani, plays to the idea of the High Line as a latter-day Readymade. Marcel Duchamp turned his bicycle wheel, snow shovel, and bottle rack into art with scant alteration. But the former elevated railway, once overgrown and abandoned, is now so groomed and urban-chic that it\u2019s a ready-made backdrop for Instagram. The site\u2019s history surfaces in one of the show\u2019s strongest works: Marianne Vitale\u2019s \u201cCommon Crossings,\u201d five salvaged railroad switches (they allow trains to change tracks), installed vertically. Below Twenty-fifth Street, the steel totems stand sentry, strange hybrids of Richard Serra and Easter Island. A few blocks south, in another twist on the Readymade, Yngve Holen sets down a pair of gleaming industrial washing-machine drums in a glib piece, titled \u201cSensitive 4 Detergent,\u201d that does little more than turn a patch of the High Line into a hillbilly front yard. \u201cPlop art\u201d is a derogatory term for public sculpture, coined in the late nineteen-sixties to describe inert minimalism in corporate plazas. In \u201cArcheo,\u201d Isabelle Cornaro is guilty of plopping. Her \u201cGod Boxes,\u201d above Gansevoort Street, are black monoliths embellished with casts of stars and twisted rope\u2014the effect is Louise Nevelson lite. Gavin Kenyon\u2019s gray, fur-flecked blob on a polychrome base, at Thirtieth Street, is ironically titled \u201cRealism Marching Triumphantly Into the City,\u201d and seems aimed at deflating the grandiosity of classical monuments. A bull\u2019s-eye it\u2019s not. In the shade of a magnolia tree near Twenty-sixth Street, a flesh-pink slab by Antoine Catala sidesteps inertia through a combination of technical ingenuity and old-fashioned creepiness: a curved green prosthesis on the front of the sculpture slowly expands and contracts, as if breathing. A few yards to the south, Jessica Jackson Hutchins has a homier take on the concept of sculptures as bodies: her ceramic assemblage kicks back in a hammock, slung so far under the walkway that it\u2019s easy to miss. Bodies at rest become the city\u2019s restless bodies in motion in Josh Kline\u2019s brilliant \u201cSkittles,\u201d near the Standard hotel. An illuminated deli display case is stocked with rows of colorful drinks in ridiculous flavors\u2014\u201cWilliamsburg,\u201d \u201cBig Data,\u201d \u201cNightlife\u201d\u2014made from surprising ingredients. (\u201cCondo\u201d blends coconut water, HDMI cable, infant formula, turmeric, and yoga mats.) Think of \u201cSkittles\u201d as Duchamp\u2019s \u201cBottle Rack,\u201d updated for the age of aspirational marketing, when even a smoothie can be spun as a status symbol. The case is locked and the bottles are beyond reach, but you can press your nose to the glass.\u00a0\u2666 By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.
