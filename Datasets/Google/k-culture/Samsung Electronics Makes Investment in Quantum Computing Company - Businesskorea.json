Quantum computing is a computational technology that processes data using quantum-mechanical phenomena such as \"entanglement\" and \"superposition.\" IBM, Intel, Google, and Microsoft are also focusing on R&D on quantum computing. Samsung's in-house venture capital, Samsung Catalyst Fund, recently made an investment in IonQ, a quantum computing company, industry sources said on Oct. 23. Samsung led a new US$55 million funding round for IonQ, where Mubadala Capital, Amazon, Hewlett-Packard Pathfinder, Airbus Ventures, ACME Capital, and A&E Investment also participated. Samsung's investment amount was not disclosed. IonQ has secured a total of US$77 million in financing and plans to invest in technology development for the commercialization of quantum computers. According to a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report, the market for quantum computing is expected to reach US$8.45 billion by 2024. Never miss another article!
