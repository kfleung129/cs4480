    "text": "The Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety has approved a clinical trial of COVID-19 vaccine \"EuCOVAC-19\" developed by EuBiologics. The ministry said on Jan. 21 that it has thus far given clinical trial approval to seven COVID-19 vaccines, including EuCOVAC-19, and 15 COVID-19 treatments. The clinical trial is aimed at evaluating EuCOVAC-19\u2019s safety and immunogenicity for healthy adults, and will proceed with Phase 1 and Phase 2 sequentially. EuCOVAC-19 is a recombinant vaccine based on surface antigen proteins from the COVID-19 virus. The vaccine's surface antigen proteins form neutralizing antibodies by stimulating immune cells. When the COVID-19 virus breaks into the body, the antibodies kill the COVID-19 virus. Currently, Novavax of the United States and other pharmaceutical companies are conducting clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines using genetic recombination technology. Currently, the seven vaccines approved for clinical trials in Korea include three DNA vaccines, INO-4800 of the International Vaccine Institute, GX-19N of Genexine and GLS-5310 of GeneOne Life Science, which are all in clinical trial phases 1 and 2; three recombinant vaccines -- SK Bioscience\u2019s NBP2001 in phase 1 and SK Bioscience\u2019s GBP510 and EuBiologics\u2019 EuCOVAC-19 in phases 1 and 2; and a virus vector vaccine -- Cellid\u2019s AdCLD-CoV19 in phases 1 and 2.
