(Photo by Greg Allen/Invision/AP) Stephen Lovekin/WireImage Roy Hay, Boy George, and Mikey Craig of Culture Club perform on NBC's \"Today\" at Rockefeller Plaza on Thursday.  Boy George cites one key reason Culture Club finally managed to reunite, 12 years after they last toured America and 16 years since they put out a new album. \u201cThree of the four of us are in recovery,\u201d George says. That\u2019s the whole band except for bassist Michael Craig. \u201cAnd he really ought  to be in recovery,\u201d says George, with a laugh. \u201cThis whole comeback is just one big amends,\u201d adds guitarist Roy Hay. Luckily, the world seems eager to accept it. Minutes before talking to the News, the now sober band played three rapturously received old hits on the Today Show\u2019s \u201cThrowback Thursday\u201d concert series. They performed, confidently and soulfully, as a promotion for their big reunion tour, which kicks off July 17 in Vancouver and hits the Beacon Theatre in New York on July 27 and 28. Backstage at \u201cToday,\u201d stars and fans alike buzzed over the band. Magician Penn Jillette maneuvered to shake George\u2019s hand. Hilary Swank broke into his dressing room to confess her lifelong devotion. One Culture Club member didn\u2019t make it to the \u201cToday Show\u201d: Drummer Jon Moss, who will perform on the tour, got laid up with back problems. Fans surely noticed the absence of Moss because George\u2019s doomed romantic relationship with the drummer played a key role in the band\u2019s original breakup in the \u201980s. George says that\u2019s all blood under the bridge, though he doesn\u2019t sugar coat on-going issues between the members. \u201cWe get on each other\u2019s nerves,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like going home for Christmas with your family. There\u2019s always going to be something said that hurts you. But you know what? I love these fools.\u201d The group tested several short-lived or aborted reunions before. George says everything changed for him relatively recently. \u201cOnly in the last five years have I really grown up,\u201d admits the star, now 54. \u201cI\u2019d been winging it before.\u201d The singer says he always had \u201cone foot in, one foot out\u201d of the band, even during their heyday. \u201cI had to go off to do my own thing, to get my confidence as a writer, and a performer,\u201d he says. Perhaps George also had to hit bottom. Seven years ago, he was arrested in Manhattan on suspicion of cocaine possession and for falsely reporting a robbery. In an interview in 2007, George said \u201cPeople have this idea of Boy George now \u2026 that I\u2019m a tragic f\u2013k up. I mean, I\u2019m all of those things. But I\u2019m also lots of things.\u201d When looking back at his long history of trouble now, George says \u201cthat person and me, there\u2019s no connection at all.\u201d He credits recovery \u2014 his and the other members\u2019 \u2014 as well as the \u201cbig revelation that you have a choice.\u201d Another key change is realizing how lucky he is. \u201cOh my God \u2014 someone just put me in a hotel room and they paid the bill! I love this job!,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re young, you just don\u2019t notice. But gratitude is a big part of recovery.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just George\u2019s substance abuse he needed to recover from. His voice also had to heal. The band was meant to launch this reunion tour last fall, but they had to cancel because of George\u2019s throat problems. \u201cI still have the problem,\u201d he says. \u201cI had an explosion on my vocal chord. They weren\u2019t joining so it was difficult to get certain sounds and my range dropped.\u201d To heal, he\u2019s been working rigorously with a vocal coach. \u201cI\u2019ve given up coffee, made diet changes,\u201d he says. \u201cI also have silent days, which the band loves.\u201d While you could hear changes in his voice at the \u201cToday\u201d show performance, they\u2019ve actually given him more texture and depth. He sounded rich and emotional on \u201cDo You Really Want To Hurt Me?\u201d and newly soulful on \u201cMiss Me Blind.\u201d The group will perform such hits on the tour, along with a few new songs. They\u2019ve already completed a full album, \u201cTribes,\u201d set to arrive in early 2016. They\u2019re delaying it to take advantage of the paucity of releases at the start of each year. It will be the band\u2019s first since 1999\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Mind If I Do,\u201d a work which bombed in the U.K. and never even came out in the U.S. George says the new songs recall old Roxy Music, T-Rex and Sly Stone. One cut even uses Sly as its main character. Of course, the world that will receive this album, and the tour, differs dramatically from the one in which Culture Club came up in the \u201980s \u2014 or even the one they last occupied over a decade ago. When Culture Club won the Best New Artist Grammy in 1983, Boy couldn\u2019t say he was gay. Now we have artists like Sam Smith, who swept the Grammys and whose sexuality draws no comment. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to live in a world where it\u2019s a non-issue,\u201d George says. \u201cMy feeling from the beginning was \u2018who cares?\u2019 I think we were part of the process of making that happen.\u201d George says he\u2019s proud of that, but he\u2019s equally pleased to have a new way to relate to his classic band. \u201cOur alchemy is so f\u2013king weird,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut there\u2019s a real symmetry to this band,\u201d adds guitarist Hay. \u201cSymmetry and anarchy,\u201d George says, with a laugh. \u201cTogether, it somehow works.\u201d jfarber@nydailynews.com Copyright \u00a9 2023 New York Daily News ",
