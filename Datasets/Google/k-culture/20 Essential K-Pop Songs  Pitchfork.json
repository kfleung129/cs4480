    "text": "Beyond the blinding videos, plastic sheen, and frank commerciality, South Korea's pop industry has also produced some of the most intelligent and accomplished mainstream music of the past few years. Practically an unknown quantity at the start of the decade, K-pop is now a household name around the globe. In recent years, the Western media has all but overflowed with a rising tide of South Korean pop, from fashion spreads to viral ads, Lorde pull-quotes to Grimes tweets, music video analyses to industry think pieces (and, of course, the most popular piece of content on the internet). And yet, so little of this attention has paid much mind to the music itself. If K-pop seems like the fad that never ends, that\u2019s probably because it never really started, either. K-pop treats a song as just one of several interlocking aesthetic parts, which typically include corresponding choreography, a music video, novella-thick liner notes, the occasional corporate tie-in, and an overarching \u201cconcept\u201d that brings it all together. These tend to be conceived in tandem to a much greater extent than in Western pop, so to divorce a K-pop single from its context is to engage with it only partially. For example, the absurdist satire of \u201cGangnam Style\u201d wouldn\u2019t make total sense even to someone living in Gangnam without its attendant video and \u201chorse dance.\u201d At its best, K-pop\u2019s package-product approach can result in concise, nonpareil pop music gesamtkunstwerks\u2014but good or bad, they can cause sensory overload for the uninitiated. The intense rate of productivity in Korea, where taking even a year\u2019s pause between albums can kill a career, also adds to the overwhelming feeling for casual fans and popstars alike; onstage fainting and use of IV drips for energy are commonplace. Another factor is the highly micromanaged way in which all these complementary pieces are made and aligned. The Western media loves to fixate on K-pop\u2019s \u201cassembly line\u201d methodology, and the industry\u2019s de rigeur trainee development program indeed prizes performative excellence over any kind of creative aptitude. Considering the cost-intensive multimedia project that is the typical K-pop smash, it\u2019s little surprise that agencies tailor these acts and their images to best court audiences that are most likely to reward their investment: obsessive teenyboppers. As such, both the presentation of the music and the \u201cimpersonal\u201d way it\u2019s made fundamentally disagree with most Western music fans\u2019 Beatles-derived notions of authenticity. (The language barrier can be a roadblock as well.) But the Korean music industry\u2014for all its bright color schemes, plastic sheen, and frankly commercial raison d'\u00eatre\u2014has quietly produced some of the most intelligent, adventurous, and accomplished mainstream pop of the past few years. It\u2019s a world where songs with whiplash tempo cuts, Punjabi-via-Korean lyrics, and irregular beats exist as hyper-realized pop commodities, but connect with audiences on a mass scale. The following list offers a modest introduction to the hugely saleable genius some of the world\u2019s best songwriters, producers, and performers can achieve when working in close cooperation. f(x): \u201c\ubbf8\ud589 (\uadf8\ub9bc\uc790 : Shadow)\u201d Simply put, f(x) is the most reliably risk-taking act in K-pop. Created in 2009 by SM Entertainment, the multinational, five-piece girl group\u2019s two albums from the past year mark an unmatched winning streak in a mainstream market more inclined toward singles and mini-albums (K-Pop\u2019s clever rebrand of the EP). \u201cShadow\u201d is one of the stranger highlights from 2013\u2019s neon Pink Tape. Built around a jazzy discord of flats and sevenths, the song\u2019s synth harmony and xylophone melodies have more in common with a Thelonious Monk rag than anything on most modern pop charts (it peaked at #6 on Korea\u2019s national chart, despite not being an official single). Exacerbating the tonal wooze is a pitch-shifted sample of what might as well be a gaggle of fairies getting fumigated. Above it all, the girls of f(x) detail a dark diary of stalking an object of desire. The fraught confessional is set to an R&B melody that\u2019s lullaby-sweet, seeming to temper the tension in the arrangement\u2014until the lyrics register. Ga-In: \u201c\ud305\ucee4\ubca8 (Tinkerbell)\u201d As the youngest member of the quartet Brown Eyed Girls, Ga-In uses her solo career to test the limits of both Korea\u2019s mainstream music and morals. \u201cTinkerbell\u201d, a coy invite to a midnight tryst, is introduced by a damaged, half-deleted Latin guitar and proceeds to synthesize wobbly LFO chords, compression-blown riffs that could deafen Sleigh Bells, violent jump cuts to millisecond silence, yawps like a young Karen O\u2019s, surf rock guitar leads, a lone bebop trumpet interjection, severe glitch undertones, and a four-bar break that snaps off-grid altogether. The song opens Ga-In\u2019s excellent Talk About S mini-album, which tempers this IDM pop opioid with the delightful Madonna throwback \u201cBloom\u201d. Orange Caramel: \u201c\uae4c\ud0c8\ub808\ub098\u00a0(Catallena)\u201d Orange Caramel\u2019s very existence is an interesting insight into the K-pop industry. The female trio is a subsidiary of the larger girl group After School\u2014in the same way that Kia is a subsidiary of Hyundai. So while Orange Caramel release their own records and stage their own performances, they are deliberately perceived as an After School-brand group, a common tactic in the K-pop market (other examples include T-ara\u2019s T-ara N4, Sistar\u2019s Sistar19, and Girls\u2019 Generation\u2019s Girls\u2019 Generation-TaeTiSeo). These derivations are typically meant to exploit the specific talents or chemistry of a subset among a larger ensemble, and Orange Caramel\u2019s uniting concept is \u201cCandy Culture\u201d\u2014basically, Korean\u00a0aegyo\u00a0cutesiness meets a lot of saccharine pastels. Fortunately, this conceit has inspired some pretty fantastic pop. Orange Caramel\u2019s best, \u201cCatallena\u201d, is a fluffy, filter-swept combo of ABBA-grade orchestration, ghazal folk samples, runny 1980s snare, Bollywood dyes, imitation Chic guitar, and a compression-lacquered coating of synth bass\u00a0\u00e0 la\u00a0\u201cBlue Monday\u201d. The bright vocal frosting is piped preciously atop it all, flirting with an exoticized other and voicing bi-curious fancies\u2014\u201cShe\u2019s so great, I\u2019ve fallen for her/ Even as a girl\u201d\u2014and they even sing some untranslated lyrics from the Pakistani wedding song that\u2019s being interpolated. The holistic effect jars at first, making \u201cCatallena\u201d a common instance where the stickiness of a K-pop song\u2019s video and choreography is crucial to its marketing plan. Unlike other mainstream industries, K-pop seems to romanticize the ideal of love at second listen. CL, G-Dragon, Skrillex, and Diplo: \u201cDirty Vibe\u201d K-pop is home to a strange graveyard of gruesomely awful trans-Pacific collisions, including bewildered cameos from Kanye West, Chris Brown, and Lil Kim. But the four artists behind this track still dared to dream. The results, though buried on Skrillex\u2019s Recess album from earlier this year, are historic: \u201cDirty Vibe\u201d is visceral, exhilarating proof that K-pop and Western musicians can achieve unique things together. G-Dragon and CL respectively hail from Big Bang and 2NE1, two of Korea\u2019s biggest groups (both fostered by YG Entertainment, the nation\u2019s most dependable charisma depot). Over Skrillex and Diplo\u2019s stark trap-hall beat, the two MCs have plenty of space to flex their best; consequent boasts touch on past hits, strip clubs, Diamonds and Pearls-era Prince, and \u201cyour girl\u2019s lesbian crush.\u201d Further charging the 160 BPM beat with fluid bilingual modulation, a plunder of profanity, and a deeply gratifying demon\u2019s harmony on GD\u2019s voice, he and CL each turn in highlight reel performances. Skrillex and Diplo sound inspired as well, particularly in the thrilling anti-drop at the 48-second mark. Almost purely rhythmic, \u201cDirty Vibe\u201d is as truly future-sounding as any of these four have been. f(x): \u201c\uccab\uc0ac\ub791\ub2c8\u00a0(Rum Pum Pum Pum)\u201d As the lead single for a blockbuster K-pop album, \u201cRum Pum Pum Pum\u201d came shrinkwrapped in a blindingly bright music video. And its performances on Korea\u2019s half dozen \u201cTop of the Pops\u201d-style battle shows\u2014an exhaustive gauntlet all acts must pass to credibly promote a single\u2014were all tightly choreographed, schoolgirl uniformed cheers. While these common tropes and marketing tactics often signify trivial music in Western pop, a peek beneath the surface of this track reveals a remarkable feat of songwriting. While retaining the familiar structure of a pop banger, \u201cRum Pum\u201d makes unlikely esperanto of Middle Eastern funk guitar, clangorous samba polyrhythms, the Yuletide classic \u201cThe Little Drummer Boy\u201d, exactly one bar of flamenco tap dance, and the ad-libbing knock of mid-aughts Timbaland. Then there\u2019s the jazz technique of brushing circles\u00a0around\u00a0the beat during the bridge, about the most counterintuitive move one can make in a commercial medium where an explicitly stated beat is fundamental. The lyrics are equally intrepid, exploiting a bit of wordplay in Korean to make a love song all about wisdom teeth: \u201cWhat to do? You probably expected one/ Who grew up straight/ But I\u2019ll be crooked and torture you/ I\u2019m not easy!\u201d Virtually every moment of the song features a compositional quirk worthy of scrutiny. \u00a9 2018 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
