By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJeff Benjamin Nearly everything about\u00a0Nickelodeon\u2019s new show\u00a0Make It Pop\u00a0sounds similar to what TV fans have\u00a0already seen \u2014 including the platform (musical-comedy, just\u00a0in time for\u00a0Glee\u2018s finale) and the setting (a\u00a0boarding school a la\u00a0Zoey 101) \u2014 but its main inspiration\u00a0is where things get unique.\u00a0Make It Pop\u00a0is inspired by Korean pop\u00a0culture, with executive producers Nick Cannon and Thomas W. Lynch (The Secret World of Alex Mack, Class of 3000)\u00a0betting on K-pop\u2019s\u00a0colorful and bubbly\u00a0aesthetic\u00a0to draw viewers with new episodes\u00a0every weeknight which has, so far,\u00a0delivered strong, consistent\u00a0ratings for\u00a0Nick\u2019s young viewers.

Cannon had worked closely with the\u00a0Wonder Girls on their\u00a0eponymous\u00a0TeenNick\u00a0film in 2012, introducing him to the highly stylized Korean entertainment world.\u00a0Ahead of Make It Pop\u2018s first season finale\u00a0on May 1,\u00a0Billboard\u00a0chatted exclusively with the rapper/actor/TV exec\u00a0about the show,\u00a0his love of \u201cmagnifying\u201d\u00a0sub-cultures and more.Why is\u00a0the world ready for a K-pop-inspired TV\u00a0show? I always say, \u201cAmerica\u2019s last to the party.\u201d Honestly. It\u2019s such a global phenomenon that I\u2019ve witnessed over the years from traveling abroad. A\u00a0few years back there was a girl group with a\u00a0Nickelodeon movie\u00a0called the School Gyrls,\u00a0from that there was the Wonder Girls and that\u2019s when I was really introduced to Korean pop and thought, \u201cThis is amazing.\u201d\u00a0I became a fan of the culture. What specifically drew you to the culture? The main reason is the admiration and respect for the fans,\u00a0how they treat the artist and how\u00a0they really become this real community. That\u2019s the thing that opened my eyes initially. And\u00a0then when you see the quality in the music and the videos, the imaging and how detailed everything was;\u00a0the pop-art feel. I thought it was just really cool, the way they presented it. Obviously, we\u2019ve always had girl groups and boy bands and all that stuff in the states. But to see the detail, the hard work and the dedication in K-pop culture, I\u2019d never seen anything like it.  So far, that\u00a0mostly thrives online and on YouTube. What was your\u00a0vision with Make It Pop\u00a0and how do you\u00a0make that translate on\u00a0television? I would say Make It Pop\u00a0was inspired by that world, but not necessarily trying to be authentic because, ultimately, at the end of the day we\u2019re making a television show for Nickelodeon. I found there were\u00a0similarities, like the colors, the fun, the music, uplifting stories, all those things were synonymous with the world and I just wanted to focus on all those aspects so, like,\u00a0\u201cHey,\u00a0we can bring all the things that people love about K-pop culture, love about Nickelodeon culture,\u00a0bring those worlds together, and I think we have a hit show.\u201dWhat were you looking for when it came to casting? You actually have Sun Hi played by\u00a0Megan Lee, who was a pop singer in\u00a0South Korea. We were blessed to be able to have Megan Lee on the show. I want to say, man, over the course of about two years, I\u2019ve seen thousands of young girls and actors for this show. To know that we were going to have three [stars]\u2026we were not going to go through this until we have the right group of girls, and we definitely found the right group. Did you learn anything from working with\u00a0Wonder Girls? The Wonder Girls\u2019 TeenNick Movie definitely helped. It was originally inspired by that.\u00a0I was introduced to the K-pop world through the Wonder Girls. Those girls are so amazing. They were so professional, so well-versed in everything entertainment\u2026very stylized, very fashionable, very funny, I wanted to implement all of those things into the show as well. Working with the Wonder Girls was great training for Make It Pop. K-pop fans can be very defensive and there was\u00a0a petition with almost 10,000 signatures demanding you cancel the\u00a0show before it aired. Did you notice any negativity\u00a0brooding?  It\u2019s interesting because while\u00a0in development, I think there was a press release that went out that I was doing a K-pop show. I would go online seeing tweets here and there about this\u2026I didn\u2019t understand why\u00a0the fans\u00a0were kind\u00a0of upset. It intrigued me like, \u201cWhy would they be mad about a big show,\u00a0that\u2019s not really even trying to be a K-pop show, but\u00a0something that\u2019s inspired by\u00a0paying tribute to their world?\u201d\u00a0because, obviously, they didn\u2019t know what the show was about.\u00a0I could imagine that someone\u00a0like myself, who\u2019s not in K-pop, you hear they\u2019re doing \u201ca K-pop show,\u201d it wouldn\u2019t make you that excited. But\u00a0I\u00a0reached out to a few of the people who were concerned \u2014\u00a0that\u2019s the beauty of being online and social media\u00a0\u2014\u00a0[I asked], \u201cWhy are you guys upset?\u201d And they were saying how much this world and these artists means to them. And I totally respected that. I assured the ones that I actually talked to that this show would do nothing but uplift the culture and pay respect to it\u2026 Ironically,\u00a0since the show has aired, I\u2019ve seen nothing but positive tweets and everything online, they\u2019re already starting fansites and stuff. I\u2019m like, \u201cYo!\u00a0We did our job. We did what we came to do.\u201d I\u2019m sure a lot of those fans would like to know, are you a personal fan of any other Korean acts? I\u2019ve had the opportunity of working close with JYP [Entertainment] and J.Y. Park, but I probably also would get in trouble if I chose anyone because you know how serious it is! I got to say everything that came from JYP and all of their acts have always been wonderful and the ones I\u2019ve been supporting throughout the years. J.Y. Park Gives Psy a Run for His Money With Ode to Big Butts, \u2018Who\u2019s Your Mama?\u2019 What else are you up to this year?  I\u2019m doing a lot of stuff. In the music space, with Wild \u2018N\u00a0Out, we\u2019re actually releasing some music from a lot of the artists. I\u2019m starting\u00a0photography for King of the Dancehall,\u00a0a\u00a0film I\u2019m starring in, directing in and wrote in Jamaica that\u2019s about the dancehall culture. Myself,\u00a0Busta Rhymes, Beenie Man, Ky-Mani Marley,\u00a0everybody in that dancehall culture because I feel like that\u2019s another sort of culture that doesn\u2019t have the opportunity to kind of have its time in cinema. You see all these kind\u00a0of watered-down\u00a0dance movies, but you never seen one about Jamaican culture. Sounds like it might be a\u00a0new-age version of Dancehall Queen. Yeah, yeah! I mean obviously, I was inspired by everything from Dancehall Queen to The\u00a0Harder They Come, movies that really pay respect to Jamaican culture. Between the cast and what we\u2019re really trying to accomplish, I feel like we\u2019re going to be one that people will reference when talking about the world of dancehall. I feel like I\u2019ve done that quite a few times, in different aspects of my career. Like in\u00a0Drumline,\u00a0shedding like\u00a0HBCU\u00a0marching band sub-culture,\u00a0Roll Bounce, even this thing with what we\u2019re talking about with K-pop, the Wonder Girls and\u00a0Make It Pop. I feel like anytime I get an opportunity to shine a light, to put the middle American magnifying glass on a sub-culture\u00a0and kind of pay respect to it, I feel like I\u2019m doing my job in entertainment.
