As organizations struggle to adjust to the new growth economy, finding top talent is one of their biggest challenges. According to a recent study from Deloitte\u2019s Global Human Capital Trends 2014, \u201cCritical new skills are scarce \u2014 and their uneven distribution around the world is forcing companies to develop innovative new ways to find people, develop capabilities and share expertise.\u201d But equally important is retaining talent once you\u2019ve found it \u2014 making sure that your efforts to identify, recruit, hire and develop talent aren\u2019t in vain. Sourcing and hiring with retention in mind requires companies to focus less on skills and experience and more on cultural fit and development potential, says Chris Duchesne, vice president of Workplace Solutions, Care.com. \u201cAt many forward-thinking companies, the leadership and hiring teams understand that technology changes so rapidly that, more important than discrete skills, is an employee\u2019s cultural fit and their ability to transfer their skills, experience and values to new technology, new endeavors, new paths to the organization. You can always teach and/or acquire new skills and gain new experiences, but it\u2019s hard to \u2018teach\u2019 culture,\u201d Duchesne says. The book \u201cTribal Leadership\u201d by David Logan, John King and Halee Fischer-Wright emphasizes the importance of workplace culture and how it can contribute to a more successful workplace. The authors found that organizations that stress cultural fit find that, within their workforce, \u201cfear and stress go down as the \u2018interpersonal friction\u2019 of working together decreases; people seek employment in the company and stay, taking the company a long way toward winning the war for talent; organizational learning becomes effortless, with the tribe actively teaching its members the latest thinking and practices; People\u2019s overall health statistics improve. Injury rates and sick days go down; and most exciting \u2026 is that [employees] report feeling more alive and having more fun\u201d in such a workplace, according to the book. \u2014 Todd Raphael, editor in chief, ERE.net Identifying talent that fits culturally within your organization can be a huge step toward employee engagement, satisfaction and long-term retention. Workplace culture is, at its heart, making sure that your employees\u2019 values, mission and personality align with those of your company, says Todd Raphael, editor in chief of recruiting site ERE.net. \u201cHiring for cultural fit above skills is a great idea, because you never know how much an employee will be developing, growing and changing over time \u2014 they could be in a completely different role by next year,\u201d Raphael says. \n\n\u201cAnd it makes sense to do so based on the industry and market you\u2019re in, too: If you\u2019re an accounting company, for instance, you don\u2019t necessarily want to hire someone who\u2019s chaotic and extremely creative. If you\u2019re a cutthroat, uber-competitive, cutting-edge company, you don\u2019t want to hire someone who\u2019s very laid-back and not as driven by competition, for instance,\u201d Raphael says. How do you identify someone who\u2019s a good cultural fit? For some organizations, it\u2019s as easy as noticing what they wear, says Care.com\u2019s Duchesne. One large manufacturer of snowboarding equipment, for example, advises potential candidates not to wear a suit to an interview; in fact, if someone does arrive wearing a suit, they\u2019re instantly discounted as not being a good cultural fit, simply based on how they\u2019re dressed, Duchesne says. For startup Grammarly.com, an automated proofreading tool for English-language writers, making sure new hires are a good cultural fit means candidates are assessed based on the acronym EAGER (Ethical, Adaptable, Gritty, Empathetic and Remarkable), says Grammarly\u2019s CEO Brad Hoover. \u201cWe codified our culture profile with one word \u2014 EAGER. Assessing skills is relatively straightforward, but culture fit is much more difficult, especially if the culture is not defined, so that was priority number one for us,\u201d Hoover says. \u201cOur hiring process is much more efficient because of this filter \u2014 we spend much less time getting to a final decision and we\u2019ve been really successful at making the right hiring decision,\u201d he says. The acronym EAGER stands for all qualities Grammarly.com looks for in its employees. Potential hires are introduced to and approved by the company\u2019s executive team, and then hiring teams are formed based on that potential employee\u2019s role and who they\u2019ll be working for and with, Hoover says. The first letter stands for Ethical, and Hoover explains that \u201cwith an ethical team, we can trust each other and put lots of responsibility in the hands of everyone on the team.\u201d \u2014 Sean Storin, CEO, One Degree This is critical in a startup with only about 70 team members split between offices in San Francisco and Kiev, Ukraine. The second letter stands for Adaptable: the ability to embrace change and learn in order to evolve and succeed, Hoover says. \u201cOur people must apply a positive, problem-solving attitude to whatever they\u2019re doing,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to be looking out for potential problems and proactively thinking \u2014 either individually or collectively \u2014 about how to solve them.\u201d The G is for Gritty, Hoover says, which emphasizes the need for both passion and perseverance when going after long-term goals. \u201cThis is especially important for a startup to do whatever it takes to get the job done whenever it is necessary,\u201d he says. \u201cAs tech companies grow, teams can\u2019t grow as quickly as the user base, so it\u2019s hard for the hiring and onboarding process to keep up as demand for the product grows. We want our people to have the grit to persevere, even when it\u2019s difficult.\u201d The second E, for Empathetic, simply means treating others as you want to be treated, to work more effectively as a team, Hoover says. Active listening and constantly \u2018putting yourself in another\u2019s shoes\u2019 are key elements of empathy, he says. \u201cWe care about this because of the implications for communication. At a foundational level, that requires mutual respect, and that\u2019s based on empathy,\u201d he says. Finally, the R is for Remarkable. Being remarkable, Hoover says, involves being recognized for being exceptional but also humble. \u201cWe want our people to be exceptional in their own right, but also to seek out others and learn from them. It\u2019s hard enough to find remarkable people, but the \u2018humble\u2019 part of it involves the recognition that there are so many things you don\u2019t know, and then finding a mentor or teacher to help you learn those things,\u201d he says. A June 2013 Gallup poll of more than 150,000 U.S. workers found that a whopping 70 percent of respondents either hated their jobs or felt disengaged, and of the main reasons cited, \u201cpoor management\u201d and \u201cpoor cultural fit\u201d were at the top of the list. Sean Storin, CEO and co-founder of recruiting and networking site One Degree, says these statistics are what prompted him and his team to develop One Degree to address the staggering number of bad hires and try to identify better employees based on culture, mission and values, he says. \u201cWe\u2019d heard that something like 89 percent of people leave a job because they\u2019re not happy. Even if that statistic is overblown, even if it\u2019s only 50 percent, that\u2019s an epidemic,\u201d he says, \u201cAnd it\u2019s as bad for the employees as it is for business.\u201d One Degree is an online career network that claims to place culture, values and mission above all else when matching candidates and potential employers, Storin says. The site does not include resumes, nor does it include job postings; instead, he says, candidates sign up and answer questions based around cultural categories to find companies and roles that would best fit for their interests, values and their lifestyle. There are three distinct ecospheres that lead to good hiring, Storin says, what a candidate knows, how the candidate lives and what the candidate wants. \u201cSkills are obviously where companies begin \u2014 the \u2018What I Know\u2019 piece \u2014 because you need someone who can execute tasks, who\u2019s familiar with tools and technology. But skills alone aren\u2019t solely what makes companies pull the trigger to hire,\u201d Storin says. \u201cThe \u2018How I Live\u2019 piece outlines the type of personal values a candidate has, and how that translates into their fit into your organization. And the \u2018What I Want\u2019 piece is an opportunity to express exactly what would make candidates happy in a work environment. The last piece is extremely important, and it\u2019s something candidates are not often faced with \u2014 it\u2019s empowering for them to have this be a major part of the hiring conversation,\u201d Storin says. One Degree does use search, networking and messaging functionality like that found in traditional job search sites like LinkedIn, Storin says, but it also incorporates algorithms to identify cultural traits and alignment with specific industries, companies and roles, Storin says. The model was similar to algorithms like those used in music discovery and playback software Pandora. \u201cWe looked at companies doing things very well in other capacities; Pandora, for instance, is using all these metrics and algorithms to match users with music they might like based on things like syncopation and beats-per-minute. We felt like this was the key to the future of employment search and answered the question of how to integrate culture into the equation,\u201d Storin says. Storin says the information gathered by One Degree\u2019s questions is also beneficial for hiring companies, and that while candidates can fill out the site\u2019s questionnaires in under five minutes, most users spend around four to five times that amount of time on the site \u2014 a conversion rate of 40 percent. \u201cIt\u2019s a coup for these huge companies to know these things about their potential hires,\u201d Storin says. \u201cAnd we already see a much greater level of engagement and interest from candidates because we are based on culture,\u201d he says. \u201cRecruiters should be addressing cultural fit already, and some of them are, but as far as it being a general practice, they just don\u2019t have the time or the bandwidth,\u201d Storin says. \u201cSo many are reduced to just scanning resumes, looking for keywords and plugging holes, and then companies wind up with bad hires, unhappy employees and disengaged workers, and that equals attrition,\u201d he says. \u201cIf employees are engaged and feel like they are part of a larger entity that mirrors their beliefs and values, they are more likely to stay when presented with a challenge,\u201d Storin says.
