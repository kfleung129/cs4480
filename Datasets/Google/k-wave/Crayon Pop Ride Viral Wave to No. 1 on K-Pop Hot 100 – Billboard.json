It\u2019s atypical to see such a new group earn such an accolade so quickly \u2014 most have the uphill battle to prove they belong at the peak of K-pop. But Crayon Pop has the viral factor that even has fellow K-pop stars like SISTAR\u2019s Bora and MBLAQ jumping on the trend.

Though, they\u2019ll have a few more chances as they have announced plans to release a single every month until their new album drops in October. Watch the electro-pop banger come to life with a live performance on music program chart show \u201cM COUNTDOWN\u201d:  Moving down the list, rapper San E sees new single \u201cStory of Someone I Know\u201d rise to the No. 3 slot, up from last week\u2019s No. 5. The track is his first release since leaving major Korean record label JYP Entertainment (home to Wonder Girls, 2PM, 2AM). The bouncy hip-hop track has a fun music video that stars Nara of rising girl group Hello Venus. Was their chemistry convincing? Watch below:   Rising boy band EXO earns their first Top 5 appearance as \u201cGrowl\u201d rockets to No. 4, up from No. 19 last week. Despite backing from the influential SM Entertainment label, the boy band had struggled to land high on the charts. Summer single \u201cWolf\u201d peaked at No. 25, laying the groundwork for this follow-up to break big ground. Like Crayon Pop, EXO also made their debut in 2012, showing impressive popularity by landing a big hit so quickly. Check out how a 12-member boy band works the stage with \u201cGrowl\u201d live on \u201cM COUNTDOWN\u201d below:  Last week\u2019s No. 1, f(x)\u2019s \u201cRum Pum Pum Pum\u201d rounds out the Top 5, falling four slots to No. 5. As the quintet continues to become more comfortable performing the complicated, multi-layered track, their vocals have become stronger and more confident with their backing track heard less and less. Watch their growth with their latest performance of the No. 1 hit below:  Other big chart moves come from Gummy (new single \u201cDay and Night\u201d debuts at No. 8), SHINee (digital single \u201cSelene 6.23\u201d begins at No. 13) ZE:A (\u201cThe Ghost of Wind\u201d starts at No. 17) and Huh Gak (whose latest single \u201cThat You\u2019re Mine\u201d makes its mark at No. 28 despite only being available to download for a few hours). On Billboard\u2019s other charts, B.A.P nabs their second No. 1 on the World Albums chart with their \u201cBadman\u201d EP featuring the three singles \u201cCoffee Shop, \u201cHurricane\u201d and \u201cBadman.\u201d\u00a0In February, their \u201cOne Shot\u201d EP also hit No. 1 on the chart. f(x)\u2019s \u201cPink Tape\u201d album, which held the No. 1 spot last week, falls to No. 7.
