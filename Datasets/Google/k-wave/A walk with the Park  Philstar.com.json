Watching K-Drama is a pastime that\u2019s slowly made me slip down the black hole that we call the Hallyu wave. Recently, it seems that everyone, from my titas to Anne Curtis, has been going crazy over Korean culture. I\u2019ve noticed that riding this wave brings with it more ways to connect with people. Finding out that others are a part of a fandom unlocks a bunch of new topics for discussion. Dinnertime conversation and Twitter threads nowadays are devoted to fangirling over Gong Yoo\u2019s personality and wondering about Song Hye Kyo\u2019s skincare routine. When we aren\u2019t fawning over the latest episode of our fave K-Dramas, we discuss the phenomenon itself. What is it about the Korean entertainment industry that makes it so appealing to us? And more importantly, what might a Hallyu star have to say about this worldwide interest? It turns out that I didn\u2019t have to wait very long for my questions to be answered. Bench hit two birds with one stone when they brought K-Drama queen Park Shin Hye (of The Heirs and Pinocchio) to the country last weekend for a string of events as part of her \u201cFlower of Angel\u201d Asia tour. Bench is a brand that feeds fandom, whether it\u2019s by producing campaigns with our favorite loveteams (those EDSA-Guadalupe billboards still guarantee kilig) or flying in K-superstars (Lee Min Ho and Super Junior\u2019s Siwon and Donghae were endorsers) to meet their fans.     After her press conference last Friday, Shin Hye (who looked exactly like I remembered her from The Heirs: still chok chok goals, except wearing a pin-striped polo dress with lace trimmings) gamely sat down \u2014 translator by her side \u2014 to answer some of my questions. When I asked what she thought of the rising global interest in Korean culture, she clarified that her opinions were her own, not primarily those of an actress. Through her translator, she said: \u201cBecause the world is changing faster than it used to be before, and people used to be a bit more passionate for Hollywood and a more Western culture. Nowadays, people are opening up to a culture where they can actually follow their peers a little bit.\u201d Citing the ever-growing K-Pop industry as an example, she mentioned that singers inspire fans because of their relatable performances and the subjects of their songs. Shin Hye also touched on the evolution of the film and TV industry, saying that, \u201cif the previous films focused more on a romantic and a cinematic kind of love, Korean dramas and TV shows focus more on relatable topics \u2014 relationships among families, romantic relationships, and (relationships) among friends.\u201d She continued: \u201cIt\u2019s something that is similar to everyone\u2019s lives. At the same time, a bit unique and with a little bit of a twist.\u201d When I asked how she thought the industry has changed in the years she\u2019s been acting, Shin Hye compared its rise to building construction: \u201cWhen buildings are built too fast, there is a (shortcut) in it,\u201d she said. Though she thinks there are many positive aspects to this rising pop phenomenon, she\u2019s worried it might be used up too quickly if it continues to grow at the same rate. She adds there may be some areas that could be amended or improved. After we exchanged our kamsahamnidas and said our annyeonghi gasibsios, I walked out of the room a bit more enlightened on the subject of Hallyu. Getting answers from Park Shin Hye only made me want to consume more \u2014 suddenly, I had the urge to binge-watch the rest of Pinocchio with a facemask on. At any rate, like millions of others, I\u2019ll keep on riding the K-wave, wherever it takes me. Philstar.com is one of the most vibrant, opinionated, discerning communities of readers on cyberspace.
