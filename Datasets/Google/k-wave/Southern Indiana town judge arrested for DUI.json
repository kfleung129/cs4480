A Louisville Metro Police arrest report states that Mickey K. Weber, 32, of Clarksville, Indiana, was arrested on January 16 after an injury accident at Lexington Road and Hamilton Avenue in the Phoenix Hill neighborhood around 12:45 a.m. According to the report, the Ford F-150 pickup that Weber was driving hit two parked cars and a fence causing about $1,000 in damage.
