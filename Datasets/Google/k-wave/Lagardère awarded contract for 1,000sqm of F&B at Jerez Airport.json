The contract, which will also see Lagard\u00e8re install 20 vending machines at the airport, will bring the opening of a Ca\u00f1as y Tapas in the boarding area, a Caf\u00e9 de Indias in the check-in lobby and a Ristorante by Pomodoro on the first floor of departures. The outlets will open in January 2019 and cover a total of 1,000sqm at an airport that saw just over 1 million passengers in 2017. Aena said the stores will reflect the airport operator\u2019s commitment to quality and offering the best possible passenger experience at the airport. Lagard\u00e8re has been developing its F&B offer across European travel retail over recent years. At its recent openings of master concessions in\u00a0Gdansk and Venice, the retailer emphasised the importance of the F&B side of the concessions to give flexibility to the wider retail operations.
