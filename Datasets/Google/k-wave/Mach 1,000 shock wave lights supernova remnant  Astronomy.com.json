    "text": "In the case of Tycho\u2019s supernova remnant, astronomers have discovered that a reverse shock wave racing inward at Mach 1,000 \u2014 1,000 times the speed of sound \u2014 is heating the remnant and causing it to emit X-ray light. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be able to study ancient supernova remnants without a reverse shock to light them up,\u201d said Hiroya Yamaguchi from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Astronomer Tycho Brahe witnessed the Tycho supernova in 1572. The appearance of this \u201cnew star\u201d stunned those who thought the heavens were constant and unchanging. At its brightest, the supernova rivaled Venus before fading from sight a year later. Modern astronomers know that the event Tycho and others observed was a type Ia supernova, caused by the explosion of a white dwarf star. The explosion spewed elements like silicon and iron into space at speeds of more than 11 million mph (5,000 km/s). When that ejecta rammed into surrounding interstellar gas, it created a shock wave \u2014 the equivalent of a cosmic \u201csonic boom.\u201d That shock wave continues to move outward today at about Mach 300. The interaction also created a violent \u201cbackwash\u201d \u2014 a reverse shock wave that speeds inward at Mach 1,000. \u201cIt\u2019s like the wave of brake lights that marches up a line of traffic after a fender-bender on a busy highway,\u201d said Randall Smith from CfA. The reverse shock wave heats gases inside the supernova remnant and causes them to fluoresce. The process is similar to what lights household fluorescent bulbs, except that the supernova remnant glows in X-rays rather than visible light. The reverse shock wave is what allows us to see supernova remnants and study them hundreds of years after the supernova occurred. \u201cThanks to the reverse shock, Tycho\u2019s supernova keeps on giving,\u201d said Smith. The team studied the X-ray spectrum of Tycho\u2019s supernova remnant with the Suzaku spacecraft. They found that electrons crossing the reverse shock wave are rapidly heated by a still uncertain process. Their observations represent the first clear evidence for such efficient \u201ccollisionless\u201d electron heating at the reverse shock of Tycho\u2019s supernova remnant. The team plans to look for evidence of similar reverse shock waves in other young supernova remnants.
