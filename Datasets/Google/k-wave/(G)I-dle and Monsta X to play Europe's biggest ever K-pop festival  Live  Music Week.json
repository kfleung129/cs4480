Email: musicweek@abacusemedia.com K-pop stars Monsta X and (G)I-dle (pictured) are the first names announced for Europe\u2019s biggest ever K-Pop festival, Kpop.Flex. On Saturday, May 14, 2022 at Frankfurt\u2019s Deutsche Bank Park, 44,000 fans will witness performances from some of the world\u2019s biggest K-pop stars, with five more acts still to be unveiled. The event is being staged by K-Pop Europa, in partnership with PK Events and Korean broadcaster SBS Television Network. K-Pop Europa is a partnership between Live Company Group and Explorado Group. A record-breaking year for K-pop drove South Korea to 44.8% growth and the position as the fastest-growing major market in 2020, according to IFPI. Its audience in the US has tripled in as many years, thanks to K-pop multi-group concerts. Kpop.Flex, the first event of its kind in Europe, aims to do the same as part of a five-year plan specifically targeting the continent. Formed through a Korean reality TV programme, Monsta X have continued to grow internationally. Meanwhile, (G)I-dle, who debuted in 2018 under Cube Entertainment, currently rank as one of the most popular K-Pop girl groups in Korea.
