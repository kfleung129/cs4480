In the K-pop scene, the debut performance of a new single is a big deal,\u00a0known as the \u201ccomeback\u201d performance or stage. With their upcoming BBMAs performance, BTS is essentially elevating themselves not only as artists who can land such a big awards-show slot,\u00a0but also as Korean-culture leaders\u00a0to create bigger and larger opportunities to lift the Korean wave.

In\u00a0these comeback\u00a0performances, acts typically get a special stage setup from the network with additional scenery and props \u2014 making the already extravagant K-pop live stages that much more extravagant\u00a0\u2014 with acts typically performing their single along with one or two album tracks. Sometimes for the really popular acts, like BTS, they\u2019re even given their own dedicated\u00a0episode\u00a0like the group had in their Comeback Show \u2013 BTS DNA special\u00a0that aired on Korean broadcast channel Mnet and included the first performances of Love Yourself: Her tracks like \u201cMic Drop\u201d and \u201cGo Go.\u201d   While there have been rare moments where K-pop acts have taken their comeback performances to non-Korean TV performances \u2014 like when boy band Teen Top debuted their new single \u201cRocking\u201d at the 2013 KCON\u00a0festival in Los Angeles \u2014 for the most part, the first performance for new music happen exclusively in Korea\u2019s broadcast world. Yet,\u00a0BTS performing their new single for the first time\u00a0at one of America\u2019s biggest award shows, alongside fellow superstars like\u00a0Janet Jackson, Camila Cabello, Shawn Mendes, Christina Aguilera, Demi Lovato and more, puts them at a new level as top-notch performers. In fact, after this performance, the next question on everyone\u2019s mind may be where will the\u00a0next\u00a0big comeback stage happen? Will it come from BTS or will another act try to one-up them? As K-pop\u2019s international interest continues to rise and its artists continue earn more visibility\u00a0in mainstream markets, could it become more of a norm for artists to debut their music on larger stages \u2014 both literally and figuratively \u2014 than what they\u2019ve done in the past in Korea? Depending on the response,\u00a0perhaps BTS will\u00a0pioneer a new a standard for Korean acts\u00a0to set in the pop world and prove that tradition doesn\u2019t necessarily always need to be the only way to do something. In fact, if given and allowed\u00a0the opportunity to innovate with their performance and premiere rollouts, perhaps K-pop could create even more excitement for the beloved Korean music shows\u00a0and their other programming to keep the Hallyu going all the more strong. New to the word \u201ccomeback\u201d when it comes to K-pop artists? Check out one of BTS\u2019 most memorable comeback stages when M Countdown created an entire custom set inspired by the band\u2019s You Never Walk Alone album paired unveiling a second set decorated by light bulbs, sky lanterns and a chandelier of flowers that showered the band with gorgeous petals.
