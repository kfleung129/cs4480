To create his fantastical stools, chairs, and tables, the Korean designer applies eight coats of epoxy resin to each balloon, making them harden into forms sturdy enough to sit on. \u201cBalloons are empty inside,\u201d muses the designer, whose works gained a cult following when New York gallery the Future Perfect showed a suite of them in Los Angeles last spring. \u201cI was fascinated by the idea that such a vulnerable material could be made solid.\u201d Seunjin Yang in his studio. \u201cI was fascinated by the idea that such a vulnerable material could be made solid,\u201d he says of his resin balloon furniture. Yang, who used to share a studio with his Hongik University peer Kwangho Lee, is now a key figure of the burgeoning Seongsu-dong design community. \u201cThis is a country where art history could not grow deep,\u201d he says, reflecting on the tumultuous colonial period and the Korean War. \u201cFinally we\u2019re seeing that being restored.\u201d A balloon is an apt analogy for the South Korean capital itself, which has emerged as a massive cultural exporter, seemingly overnight. This Korean Wave, or hallyu\u2014an initiative strenuously backed by the South Korean government\u2014has landed a series of victories in the last year alone. Korean-American video artist Nam June Paik was the subject of a sprawling exhibition at the Tate Modern. Bong Joon-ho\u2019s Parasite took the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes, a Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film, and both Bong and his film have been nominated for Oscars this year. Girl group Blackpink became the first K-pop band to play at Coachella. And boy-band sensation BTS became the first group since the Beatles to earn three U.S.  number one albums in a year (their hit video for \u201cBoy With Luv\u201d was also the fastest ever to reach 100 million views on YouTube). \u201cThey\u2019re inspired by stone stacks, something Korean people make when they\u2019re wishing for love, or luck on a test,\u201d Ok Kim explains of her colorful side tables, which she regularly assembles into totems for display. (Two groups are pictured here.) \u201cThey always look precarious, but somehow they balance.\u201d After studying wood craft at Pusan National University, Kim went to Hongik University for furniture design and apprenticed under a master artisan to learn ottchil, the Korean traditional lacquer method. She now gives the labor-intensive process a contemporary twist, hand-brushing coat after coat onto steel forms, then sanding away to reveal painterly patterns. A single table can take nearly four months to finish. Working with the lacquer feels autobiographical for Kim, who says, \u201cI am Korean; these works show who I am.\u201d Amid all that, a crop of experimental art-designers emerged across the rosters of Western design galleries such as Salon 94 Design, Cristina Grajales, R & Company, and the Future Perfect. It was more of a ripple at first\u2014a foam-y chaise here, a balloon chair there\u2014at fairs and in small exhibitions. But as the numbers reach a critical mass, the Western design world, collectors in particular, have started to connect the dots. \u201cThere\u2019s a renaissance happening right now in Seoul,\u201d explains Jillian Choi, a Korean-American art and design consultant. For the last two years she has worked alongside Say Hi To\u2019s Kristen de la Valli\u00e8re to curate a talks series for Design Salon Seoul, an annual design conference. \u201cAnd the curiosity about Korea is growing, particularly from Europe and New York.\u201d \u201cIt all started with matching materials together,\u201d says Jeongwha Seo whose stool-like \u201cmaterial containers\u201d and \u201cstructures for use\u201d have been shown by Carwan Gallery. It was an accident, really, he explains. One day in 2013 he noticed a piece of volcanic rock placed, by chance, in a brass container. Interested in the material dialogue he began to try other combinations: acrylic and brass, basalt and teak, cork and cast aluminum, traditional rush (woven by artisans in Kanghwa island) and oxidized copper, a series that he has continued to this day. \u201cRather than focusing on the meaning of a single material I focus on the synergy between the two materials,\u201d he explains. Based in Seongsu-dong, just across the street from Kwangho Lee, his Hongik University peer, he says \u201cI see more and more furniture designers here in Seoul. I think now people are more willing to experiment.\u201d It hasn\u2019t always been so. South Korea\u2019s economic and cultural boom (their GDP is now ranked 12th in the world) all happened in the course of a single generation. In 1910, after the 500-year reign of the Joseon dynasty, Korea\u2019s last independent monarchy, the nation was annexed and harshly ruled by neighboring Japan. Even when, with the help of Allies, the nation obtained independence in 1943, it still reeled with internal struggles, and the Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953, ultimately cleaved the nation into North and South. It was not until the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul that South Korea began to get its footing, using the event, much like Japan had in 1964, as its unofficial entree onto the global stage. \u201cJapanese occupation tried to suppress all traces of Korean culture and language,\u201d explains Elisabeth Agro, curator of American modern and contemporary crafts and decorative arts at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. She is currently working with Hyunsoo Woo, the museum\u2019s curator of Korean art, on an upcoming show about contemporary Korean art, craft, and design. Agro did the math: For more than 70 years, Koreans were consumed with the hardships of occupation, war, and the fight for democracy. \u201cThat\u2019s a long time to not engage with and celebrate their centuries-old traditions,\u201d she says. When Sang-Hoon Kim, who graduated from Cranbrook Academy of Art in 2009, returned home and started working at his family\u2019s Seoul foam factory, he thought his design practice (slick, digitally produced pieces in wood and metal) would have to go on hold. But he soon had an epiphany: \u201cFoam is fun, interesting, and best of all [for me] free.\u201d After-hours he began experimenting with the material, often used for mattresses, shoe soles, and the like. Soon he was carving it into abstract sofas and chairs\u2014some blobby, like melted marshmallows; others clean-lined, like supersize kitchen sponges. After making a splash at Cristina Grajales Gallery\u2019s 2018 booth for Design Miami, he\u2019s now working on a finish to make the chairs suitable for the outdoors. Perhaps in light of that, many of the first Seoul-based designers to emerge in the West\u2014most of them shown by the now-shuttered Gallery Seomi, which began exhibiting at Design Miami/Basel in 2009\u2014used their work to revisit Korea\u2019s rich history of craft. Ceramist Hun Chung Lee used clay from his studio just outside of Seoul to create modern interpretations of traditional moon jars as well as chunky, richly glazed tables and stools. Myung Sun Kang created sinuous furnishings using centuries-old mother of pearl inlay and lacquer techniques. \u201cThere\u2019s a cultural exchange happening from both directions,\u201d explains R & Company\u2019s Zesty Meyers, who has been traveling to Seoul since the early 2000s and represents Hun Chung Lee and woodworker Bae Sae Wah. \u201cYou have the first generation of Koreans who are coming to the U.S. and Europe for school and bringing those ideas back home. Then you have galleries showing Korean works stateside for the first time.\u201d Despite the urge to reinterpret traditions, some of today\u2019s buzziest Korean talents say they\u2019d rather look forward. \u201cOur generation has to find the materials of our time,\u201d explains Sang-Hoon Kim, who grew up in Seoul and studied at Michigan\u2019s Cranbrook Academy of Art. He returned to his hometown to run his family\u2019s foam factory, and has been making experimental furnishings with the squooshy industrial material, debuted in the U.S. by Cristina Grajales in 2018. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have design history here, so we are making the scene; making Korean design.\u201d \u201cOur generation has to find the materials of our time. We don\u2019t really have design history here. So we are making Korean design.\u201d That certainly feels true back in Seoul\u2019s Seongsu-dong, where a creative scene is putting down roots. More than a decade ago, after graduating from the nearby Hongik University, designer Kwangho Lee set up a studio in the neighborhood, where rent was cheap and spaces were big. \u201cThere\u2019s this innate Korean quality of fastness,\u201d he explains. \u201cWanting to learn something fast, show something fast.\u201d As his creations\u2014material experiments in weaving, and enameled copper\u2014found an audience in the West via New York\u2019s Salon 94 Design, he harnessed the creative momentum around him, helping peers find and share spaces in the neighborhood. \u201cWe stick together,\u201d says Lee, who now keeps a studio across the street from his schoolmate, Jeongwha Seo, known for his nuanced material pairings shown by Carwan Gallery, and rents studio space upstairs to Jaewon Choi and Yoonjeong Lee, interior designers, and Eunkook Park, a painter, all Hongik graduates. Lee even set up an exhibition space called Supply Seoul nearby, where he showcases the works of rising local talents. \u201cJaeryo, if you translate it, means \u2018material,\u2019 \u201d says Nuri Kim, explaining the name of the firm she cofounded with fellow designer Sangwon Oh. The moniker is fitting. The two teamed up in 2018, dedicating themselves to different media. Kim has focused on ceramics, using both plaster-mold and hand-building techniques to create futuristic formations in clay. Oh, on the other hand, studied pulp and paper engineering and channeled that knowledge into a body of work in papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9. \u201cSeoul is so fast-paced,\u201d says Kim, who is interested in beadwork and jewelry. \u201cI\u2019m constantly thinking about new ideas, what to do next.\u201d One such newbie is Nuri Kim, who cofounded the firm Jaeryo alongside Sangwon Oh just two years ago. Her hand-built clay Nuage table was shown at Supply Seoul in 2018, a major boost to her young studio. \u201cJaeryo, if you translate it, means material,\u201d says Kim, who focuses on ceramics, while Oh works mostly in papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9\u2014a medium that, he explains, doesn\u2019t have much of a history in Korea. \u201cWhen it comes to paper, people only think of traditional hanji,\u201d he says. That dialogue between old and new\u2014often in the form of material experiments\u2014plays heavily into the freshest iteration of Seoul-grown design. Take Jang Hea Kyoung, of FICT Studio, for example, who has created futuristic works out of scrap marble, model-making foam, and loess, a type of sediment often used as a building material in Korea. Then there\u2019s Ok Kim, who apprenticed under a master artisan to learn ottchil, the centuries-old Korean natural lacquer method. She now applies it by hand to geometric steel forms, layer after layer, before sanding it away to reveal painterly patterns. FICT studio, run by Jang Hea Kyoung, stands for From Craft to Industry, an idea embodied by the designer\u2019s far-reaching material experiments. Reinventing materials that have been undervalued, discarded, or traditionally used in Korea, she has found new life for marble scraps, blobby model-making foam, and loess, a sediment used as a traditional building material in Korea. \u201cIf you look around, it seems true that there are more and more friends running independent design studios like me in Seoul,\u201d she explains. She chalks it up to a cultural shift from a society that values the interests of groups and organizations to one that values that values the individual. \u201cThe latent desire for personal expression, is finally being expressed.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s an inventiveness, a curiosity in materiality and process,\u201d says Choi. \u201cYou see things that are actually new.\u201d Agro reasons that newness stems from designers who are \u201creinterpreting centuries-old craft traditions to invent contemporary designs. The work speaks to this century, yet still connects to their rich history.\u201d It's interesting, though, that most Seoul designers don\u2019t feel they\u2019re doing anything all that different. They say the difference is all the attention from the West\u2014a market for the first time. The galleries and collectors that are inquiring about their work, many of them say, are not local. But, according to Choi, that could change. \u201cThe entry point for design is through art,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the art market in Seoul is quite established.\u201d Any way you cut it, though, something is changing. As Yang explains it, \u201cThis was a country where the art history could not grow deep. There was a big decrease of art and culture. But now we\u2019re seeing that being restored.\u201d Only time will tell if the balloon, inflated so swiftly, will, like those hanging from the ceiling in his studio, maintain its shape.
