In 2017, there were around 160,000 visa applicants compared to the 120,000 in 2016 and 90,000 in 2015. \u201cThis increase in number of visa applicants caused the applicants to stand in hot weather outside the embassy for hours to wait in line for their turn to apply for respective visa,\u201d the Korean Embassy said.
