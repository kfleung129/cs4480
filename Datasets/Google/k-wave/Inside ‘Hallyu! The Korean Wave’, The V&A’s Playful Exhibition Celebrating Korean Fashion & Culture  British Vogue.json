Japanese films and J-pop were banned until 1998, and Korea felt culturally deprived. I often wished I had been born in London or New York instead. So to see my favourite museum in London, the V&A, stage a first-of-its-kind exhibition celebrating\u00a0the meteoric rise of\u00a0Korean culture in the same month that I witnessed the remarkable success of Frieze Seoul is simply electrifying. With more than 200 objects and immersive experiences,\u00a0Hallyu!\u00a0The Korean Wave, lets you into the groovy, joyful and vibrant world of K-pop, K-film, K-beauty and beyond. Section one, \u201cFrom Rubble To Smartphones\u201d,\u00a0provides historical context for the rapidly growing fascination with South Korean culture.\u00a0You see a monumental 1986 video sculpture by artist\u00a0Nam June Paik, who was ahead of his time in foreseeing the future of telecommunications. Paik would be proud of the way that young Koreans today have conquered\u00a0the world with their digital savvy,\u00a0absorbing everything cool and sharing it instantly. Whether through choreography, fashion, art or music, Koreans\u2019 desire to express their personal taste has propelled the Korean wave to the forefront of the global consciousness. The Squid Game costumes are on display as part of Hallyu! By Hannah Coates By Hannah Jackson By Sunita Kumar Nair It\u2019s remarkable how, within living memory, Korea has grown from one of the poorest countries in the \u201960s to the cultural powerhouse we see today.\u00a0The 1988 Seoul Olympic Games were a source of renewed national pride for Korea, and on show here is a volunteer guide uniform from the games. This uniform drew inspiration from the hanbok, the national costume, and still looks stylish today. In the later fashion section of the exhibition, the hanbok is a strong focus. The second section of the exhibition, \u201cSetting The Scene\u201d delves into K-drama and film. The iconic pink guard costumes and green tracksuit from hit Netflix series\u00a0Squid Game\u00a0are\u00a0obvious crowdpleasers, as is the set recreation from Bong Joon-ho\u2019s Oscar-winning film\u00a0Parasite.\u00a0Don\u2019t miss a\u00a0grooming kit and the handwritten letter from Park Chan-wook\u2019s\u00a0The Handmaiden, and prop photographs from indie film\u00a0Minari. That said, there is an exciting new generation of female filmmakers in Korea, and it\u2019s a shame not to see them celebrated more here. House of Hummingbird by Kim Bora is mentioned, but I left wishing there was more space. A view of Nam June Paik\u2019s Mirage Stage. By Hannah Coates By Hannah Jackson By Sunita Kumar Nair As you move through the exhibition, the energy starts to build. In \u201cGlobal Groove\u201d, the unabashed celebration of the glamour and joy of K-pop and the fantasy that\u2019s contained within its videos and staging is on full display. Entering the gallery through a corridor lined with dozens of light sticks \u2013 including ones for K-pop heroes Blackpink, BTS, Big Bang, NCT and Twice \u2013 makes you feel like you\u2019re eagerly waiting for those idols to appear onstage. For K-pop fans, light sticks are a way to interact with bands during live shows, glowing in a colour associated with a group. These light sticks are a nod to an underground movement, driven by a\u00a0tech-savvy and socially conscious fanbase who have felt empowered by K-pop and all it represents. For those eager to try out their own K-pop dance moves, the interactive dance challenge is a must.\u00a0Enter a dedicated booth with an energetic K-pop soundtrack and find out if you\u2019re a trainee, rookie or superstar.\u00a0Your recorded moves become part of an evolving wall display, created in partnership with the Google Arts & Culture Lab. \u201cUntitled G-Dragon: A Space Of No Name\u201d by Gwon Osang. By Hannah Coates By Hannah Jackson By Sunita Kumar Nair A rising star in the Korean art world, sculptor Gwon Osang also presents a K-pop idol duelling with another version of himself in his sculpture \u201cUntitled G-Dragon: A Space Of No Name\u201d.\u00a0Long before Jennie charmed Chanel, G-Dragon became a global style icon \u2013 adored by the late Karl Lagerfeld for his bold, androgynous looks. It is wonderful to see him celebrated here. Also not to be missed? The looks created for the V&A show by celebrated K-pop stylist and visual director Gee Eun, who has worked closely with G-Dragon and Blackpink in the past. In the exhibition catalogue, Gee Eun says, \u201c[What\u2019s] key for me is not just working with international labels but finding ways to bring what is most Korean to the contemporary world,\u201d an ethos embodied within these works. K-pop is central to the exhibition. The final section, \u201cInside Out\u201d, homes in on K-beauty and fashion, underlining their origins while\u00a0showcasing the innovation that has\u00a0led to new aesthetic standards.\u00a0Remixing different inspirations is one of the key tenets of contemporary Korean style.\u00a0Hallyu!, in particular, explores how new creatives are reimagining and playing with the silhouette of hanbok through design and styling. By Hannah Coates By Hannah Jackson By Sunita Kumar Nair \u201cI wanted to mix traditional Korean garments with European ones, so I asked for the entire list of the European costumes and mannequins the V&A owns to figure out what to match,\u201d\u00a0says acclaimed stylist Suh Younghee of her contribution. For Hallyu!, she combines multiple layers of summer hanbok underskirts, underpants and under jackets with an 18th-century European hoop skirt to create a unique look called Beyond Underwear. Meanwhile, Tchai Kim, who pioneered the \u201cfashion hanbok\u201d movement to give an elevated status to traditional costumes (her dresses are most coveted for Korean brides), has transformed a cheollik, or men\u2019s riding coat, into an exquisite women\u2019s ensemble using luxurious silk. The Peony dress by Miss Sohee. You can glimpse into the future of K-fashion with works from young designers, too. Ji Won Choi\u2019s hanbok-influenced leisurewear, made in collaboration with Adidas in 2019, has been worn by Beyonc\u00e9. Freshly graduated from Central Saint Martins, Sohee Park of Miss Sohee is being heralded as a new-gen couturier. Her sculptural silhouettes are carefully crafted and embroidered by hand using deadstock and recycled fabric. With so much flux and contrast in Korean culture, it is a challenging task to cover so many facets, and at times there is a lack of cohesion in the staging. However, throughout\u00a0Hallyu!,\u00a0there is an abundance of dynamic energy on display that echoes that of Korea itself. It will make you want to dance and sing \u2013 and it will make you want to remix like Koreans do. By Hannah Coates By Hannah Jackson By Sunita Kumar Nair Hallyu!
