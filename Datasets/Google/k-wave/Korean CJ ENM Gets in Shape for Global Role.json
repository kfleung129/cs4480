    "text": " By \n\n\tPatrick Frater Asia Bureau Chief  Make no mistake: CJ ENM is on the move. The South Korean conglomerate that has done as much as any company to build out the nation\u2019s entertainment ecosystem is actively looking to expand its \u201cproduction capability and competency.\u201d That\u2019s the word from Kang Ho-sung, CEO of the cluster of film, TV and music companies that now share the CJ ENM banner. Kang gave a rare, extensive interview to Variety on Aug. 21 in downtown Los Angeles on the sidelines of CJ ENM\u2019s KCON LA pop culture convention, which brought in close to 100,000 fans from across the U.S. Despite the palpable teen spirit that KCON brought to two packed concerts at Crypto.com Arena, Kang describes CJ ENM\u2019s current mission in terms that are both humble and loftily ambitious. \u201cOur core bread-and-butter business is as a content provider. Our biggest goal is to create premium well-made content and expand it globally,\u201d Kang says. Since the beginning of 2020, CJ ENM has dramatically raised its profile in Hollywood by buying a minority stake in David Ellison\u2019s Skydance Media and a majority interest in Endeavor Content, which this week unveiled a company rebrand and new moniker as Fifth Season. It has also put a marker down in the metaverse with an investment in \u201cdigital humans\u201d purveyor Hyperreal. Late last month, CJ ENM announced the appointment of Steve W. Chung, a former Fox executive, as the group\u2019s chief growth officer. Significantly, he is to be based in Los Angeles, not Seoul. At home, CJ ENM has thrown out its previous playbook, ditching outright ownership and control for partnerships that bring in capital, accelerate growth and share risk and rewards. In 2020, it spun off its TVing streaming platform and recapitalized it in an alliance with tech giant Naver and broadcaster-producer JTBC. TVing has since merged with smaller rival Seezn while retaining Seezn\u2019s helpful connections with KT Corp., formerly known as Korea Telecom. To ramp up production of K-content still further, the conglomerate has launched CJ ENM Studio, a TV production cluster headed by ace film producer-director JK Youn. It has built the largest virtual production studio in Asia and struck a joint venture deal in Japan for its Studio Dragon television production arm. \u201cOur primary goal is to maximize content production capability and competency,\u201d says Kang. That is expected to help TVing in its quest to overtake Netflix in Korea and become the country\u2019s biggest streamer. But Kang says there is no plan to halt external program sales by the group\u2019s many production units: \u201cOur dual-pronged approach in content means we are not going to limit ourselves. We want to utilize external content platforms as well.\u201d Studio Dragon is still renegotiating its deal to supply Netflix, and CJ ENM has formed an alliance with Paramount Global. Paramount+ was recently launched in Korea as a component of TVing, while CJ ENM shows are also playing on Paramount\u2019s FAST service Pluto TV. Given the efforts to establish two-way production flows between Korea and Endeavor Content and the seemingly insatiable current demand for K-content, Kang sees CJ ENM as heading to the level that corporate founders Jay and Miky Lee only dreamed of. \u201cOur multi-studio structure will give us a solid foundation to create more global projects and expand to the global stage,\u201d says Kang. Over its quarter-century in business, CJ ENM has had to invent the Korean film business almost from scratch. And it nurtured music fandom in Korea by launching a TV music channel (Mnet) and related awards show (MAMAs). In the past eight years, the group has industrialized the Korean TV production sector through the creation of Studio Dragon, a hub studio with quality control, finance and marketing functions surrounded by a corona of hot shops representing 300 creatives. Studio Dragon this year is making 32 shows for local broadcasters and international streamers and expects to raise that number to 50 in 2023. The film business nevertheless remains a key reference point. \u201cThe promise we made [when starting in multiplexes] was a signal to the industry that we were going to build a certain amount of screens, that we were going to make good movies and we\u2019re going to secure screens [to distribute them on]. That translated into a predictability that allowed [third-party] financial firms to start investing in the movie industry,\u201d says Kang. \u201cWe also made sure that profits from cinemas were reinvested into the production environment. It was a virtuous circle.\u201d Kang was not a CJ staffer in the group\u2019s early years, but rather a media lawyer able to closely observe the transformations. By 2019, thanks to consistently strong local film performances and enviably high per capita attendance rates, South Korea was the world\u2019s fourth-largest box office market \u2014 ahead of many more populous countries. Along the way CJ has produced or financed films including \u201cOld Boy,\u201d \u201cSnowpiercer\u201d and the multi-Oscar-winning \u201cParasite.\u201d But the impact of COVID on the theatrical industry halted the momentum that CJ\u2019s film operations might have expected to enjoy following \u201cParasite.\u201d COVID, the Korean wave and the arrival of international streamers in Korea, instead, hastened CJ ENM\u2019s moves in TV, streaming and music \u2014 and accelerated a push to be present in entertainment outside Asia. Still, as far back as the mid-1990s, the sibling founders of CJ Entertainment saw for themselves a global role and kicked off their plans with a $300 million minority investment in the fabled DreamWorks SKG mini studio. It has taken more than two decades for the Lees\u2019 ambition to come close to fruition. But its leaders are determined to get the group into the right shape to seize the opportunity presented by the unprecedented worldwide mania for Korean contemporary culture. \u201cThe reason why we started with DreamWorks was because we wanted to learn what the global standards were and to adopt them,\u201d says Kang.
