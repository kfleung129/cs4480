By \n\n\tRebecca Sun Senior Editor, Diversity & Inclusion  There were four days this summer \u2014 Aug. 15 through 18 \u2014 when it was nearly impossible not to overhear at least a snippet of Korean pop music in Los Angeles.  Downtown, 103,000 K-pop fans mobbed the L.A. Convention Center for KCON LA, a Korean pop culture festival that featured performances by Seventeen, Mamamoo and a dozen other bands. Meanwhile, just 3\u00bd miles east, in L.A. State Historic Park, another crowd of 25,000 music lovers was partying at Head in the Clouds, a slightly grittier festival \u2014 dubbed the \u201cAsian Coachella\u201d \u2014 that showcased acts like iKon and Korean-American rapper Dumbfoundead.  And it\u2019s not just happening in L.A.: K-pop is becoming harder to miss all over the planet, with KCON conventions sprouting up in Mexico, France, United Arab Emirates, Thailand, Japan and Australia. The K-pop industry notched $5 billion in global sales in 2017, a 9.3 percent increase from the year before, and $2 billion in the first half of 2018, according to the government\u2019s Korea Creative Content Agency. K-pop is now the seventh-most-popular genre in the world, ahead of metal, R&B and classical, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. And according to the Korea Foundation, a nonprofit that keeps track of such things, the global audience for Hallyu \u2014 Korean pop culture \u2014 is expected to hit 100 million in 2020. For context, the population of South Korea is 51 million. \u201cThe West is smart and wants to get into that market,\u201d notes Peter Chun, former U.S. director for the K-pop label YG Entertainment who in February launched theQoos, an app that aggregates K-pop content for English-language fans. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve finally come to a place where we can collaborate and it makes sense for both sides.\u201d  Of course, BTS remains the giant of the industry, but other bands are breaking out and climbing up the charts, like Blackpink, the first K-pop girl group to play Coachella. K-pop\u2019s share of total listening on Spotify grew by more than 1,000 percent between January 2014 and April 2019. No surprise, then, that more Western record labels have begun courting the genre \u2014 Columbia, Interscope, Capitol, Republic, Epic and RCA now all have K-pop artists in their rosters. And Western acts are increasingly collaborating with their Korean counterparts. Lizzo remixed her chart-topper \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d with K-pop boy band AB6IX, while Lil Nas X partnered with BTS\u2018 RM for a Korean-themed remix of \u201cOld Town Road\u201d (called \u201cSeoul Town Road\u201d). Even Hollywood has been trying to cash in on the craze. Scooter Braun announced plans in August to develop a K-pop feature with Fox 2000, and at least two other projects at other major studios are in various stages of development. \u201cThe two pop cultures are getting closer, which is why K-pop is now resonating in the West,\u201d says Chun. \u201cWhen Girls\u2019 Generation was on David Letterman [in 2012], it was a big deal. I thought the genre was peaking then, but now companies bring Asian artists out here for a whole day of television: Good Morning America, Ellen, Stephen Colbert. These groups are taking it to a new level, and it could still get bigger.\u201d This story first appeared in the Oct. 1 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.
