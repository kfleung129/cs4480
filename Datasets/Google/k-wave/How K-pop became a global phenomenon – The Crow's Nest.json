Courtesy of Jimmy Fallon on Instagram By Aya Diab Thanks to strong vocal abilities, impressive stage presence and well-choreographed dance performances, K-pop has become a global phenomenon. Hallyu, or the \u201cKorean wave\u201d is used to describe how South Korean culture ranging from K-pop and K-drama to Korean food and skincare came to prominence across the world. So how did K-pop conquer the world? In 1992, a South Korean band called \u201cSeo Taiji and Boys\u201d performed \u201cI Know\u201d live in a television talent contest. They introduced a new trend in the music industry back then: A mix of Korean lyrics, European pop and hip-hop and rap. But the judges didn\u2019t like it, and the band was eliminated from the show. Little did they know that for the next 17 weeks, \u201cI Know\u201d smashed previous records and peaked at the top of the charts. That night in 1992, K-pop was born. Now, K-pop is a multi-billion dollar industry that contributes to a constant surge in tourism and increased appeal to South Korean products. \u201cI like K-pop because of the hip-hop and R&B elements they incorporate into their own unique style,\u201d said Camiya Williams, a freshman finance major on the Tampa campus. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved Asian media and music from other countries. But Korean music often takes influence from black culture that I find comfort in. There\u2019s also a big emotional connection between fans and idols that I appreciate too.\u201d BTS, or the Bangtan Boys, debuted in 2013 and is one of the most famous bands of South Korea. They are known as \u201crecord setters\u201d as their albums sell out within minutes. In February 2020, a special episode featuring BTS on the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon aired where they performed \u201cON\u201d at the Grand Central Terminal. As of June, BTS has sold more than 4 million albums, only in 2020, and the runner up is not even close. Their last album, \u201cMap of the Soul,\u201d topped the charts in South Korea, U.S. Billboard 2020 and the UK\u2019s official album chart. BTS' 'Map of the Soul: 7' is their the fourth No. 1 in less than two years. https://t.co/Kr0g9FBcMe \u201cI was introduced to K-pop back in December of 2019 by a friend,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThe first group that I started to like was Twice, but I didn\u2019t consider myself a K-pop fan until March because of BTS\u2019 comeback.\u201d Blackpink, a South Korean girl group, debuted in 2016. It\u2019s taken them just four years to become one of the most popular girl bands in the world. In 2019, Blackpink was the first K-pop group to perform at Coachella and to reach more than 13 billion views on their YouTube channel. On Oct. 14, Netflix released \u201cBLACKPINK: Light Up the Sky,\u201d which tells a story of the \u201crecord-shattering Korean girl band.\u201d The secret behind this craze over K-pop comes from different places. \u201cI like K-pop and K-dramas because they have a message and storyline I look for,\u201d said Thuy-Trang Tran, a sophomore health sciences major at the Tampa campus. \u201cI was also looking for things that I felt represented in. Watching American TV (there was) no one I could relate to, so watching K-pop videos or K-dramas allowed me to feel like I matter \u2013 like I had a choice, or least people that looked like me.\u201d Fans feel that K-pop gives them a space to belong and relate to. \u201cI didn\u2019t really mean to choose K-pop over other genres with a clear intent in mind but I think the main reason as to why I did was because of the sense of community that came with it,\u201d Tran said. K-pop is thriving, but its worldwide fame may have brought many misconceptions and myths. \u201cThe biggest misconception about K-pop is that it\u2019s a mindless trend that will die off soon and fans only consist of 13-year-old girls who want to marry the members,\u201d Williams said. \u201cK-pop existed before it got Western attention and will continue to exist after because it\u2019s part of Korean culture.\u201d Another major misconception isn\u2019t about K-pop itself, but about its fans. \u201cWhen the term K-pop gets brought up, the music isn\u2019t what people diss, but the fans,\u201d Tran said. \u201cThey think that the fans are crazy and too immersed in the group. When in reality the fans are just people trying to enjoy something and show others the things that brought them joy.\u201d K-pop remains one of the most interesting \u2013 and questioned \u2013 industries of all time. Many claims about the \u201cdark side\u201d of K-pop emerged over the years and multiple investigations have been launched as scandals keep bringing unwanted attention to the industry. Despite the controversy, K-pop is still gaining popularity from all around the world. thanks alot of information Your email address will not be published.
