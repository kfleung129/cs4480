The show, which is airing in a 20-day burst rather than a once-a-week series, centers around three teenage girls attending an East Coast prep school who decide to form a band, despite a variety of typical teen sitcom hurdles. The three leads, Megan Lee, Louriza Tronco, and Erika Tham, are all of Asian descent, and the show emphasizes its K-pop inspiration in it\u2019s music and styling. Hallyu, the wave of Korean pop culture, is cresting all over the world, prompting a renewed interest in the language, retooling how women approach make-up, and now influencing the programming decision of cable networks. The Korean rapper Psy\u2019s \u201cGangnam Style\u201d video was the first to reach one billion views on YouTube, and introduced the polished, virulent form of Korean pop music to a global audience. Some K-pop fans were skeptical of Nickelodeon\u2019s intentions when creating the show, and an online petition to cancel the show reached over 9,000 signatures. The show was not without some hiccups before it was even launched. Lee sued her label last year to end her contract. It\u2019s yet to be seen whether audiences will find the show to be a genuine addition to the K-pop pantheon, or merely a hollow facsimile. The show airs on Nickelodeon at 7 p.m. or can be streamed from the Nickolodeon website. Michael D. Nguyen is a writer and digital strategist living and working New York City.
