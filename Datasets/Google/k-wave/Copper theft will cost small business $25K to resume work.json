    "text": "LOUISVILLE, KY (WAVE) - It will cost a local business $25,000 to get refrigerators running again after they were ripped open in a copper wire theft. William Toney, 21, of West Point, Ky., was staying in a motel next to Carter's Taxidermy and Deer Processing. A police report from Tuesday alleges Toney cut and took copper wiring from two large storage freezers. Toney left the room next door, according to the police report, because he did not pay to stay. However, a missing pillow case from the room matched a pillow case that police said contained the copper scraps. Toney faces a felony charge of committing an unlawful act to acquire metals / injury to property more than $3,000 and first-degree criminal mischief. 24-year-old Todd Adams is also charged in the case.
