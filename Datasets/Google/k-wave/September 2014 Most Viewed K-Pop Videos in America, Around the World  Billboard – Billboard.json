TTS\u2019 \u201cHoller\u201d and 2PM\u2019s \u201cGo Crazy!\u201d were the No. 1 and No. 2 most viewed K-pop videos in America and around the world, respectively, with the rest of the ranking mixed past this Top 2. The members of Girls\u2019 Generation and 2PM have undoubtedly been leaders in the Korean wave. Notable moves on the American ranking come from New Jersey-bred singer\u00a0Ailee in snagging\u00a0the third most-watched vid with \u201cDon\u2019t Touch Me.\u201d She comes out over videos like T-ara\u2018s \u201cSugar Free\u201d and Teen Top\u2018s \u201cMissing\u201d that also rank high on the global chart.

BTOB is still an act on the rise in Korea, but could perhaps be garnering a supportive fanbase stateside based on the reaction to their \u201cYou\u2019re So Fly\u201d vid. Meanwhile, this is the second time Orange Caramel landed on the American chart, but not the global chart, with \u201cThe Gangnam Avenue\u201d ranking at No. 7. Their \u201cAbing Abing\u201d video was the eighth most watched K-pop video in America in May 2014. Elsewhere, a new version of\u00a0Super Junior\u2018s \u201cMamacita\u201d video \u2014 a fun, six-minute \u201cdrama version\u201d \u2014 ranks on both lists as does the bizarre video for \u201c11\u201d by Hitchhiker, a producer under SM Entertainment (home to Super Junior, Girls\u2019 Generation, TVXQ! and more). Ladies\u2019 Code\u2018s touching tribute video to their late members EunB and Rise was the ninth most-watched video globally, according to YouTube.
