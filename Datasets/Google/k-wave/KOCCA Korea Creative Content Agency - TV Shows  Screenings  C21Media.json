    "text": "KOCCA: Korea Creative Content Agency - TV Shows South Korean content has been selling around the world for a long while but last year saw a boost in demand, according to Kocca\u2019s Do Hyoung Lee, who talks us through the content export agency\u2019s 21-title playlist on C21\u2019s Digital Screenings.  It\u2019s no secret that South Korean dramas and formats are hot property and have been for some time now. Scripted shows like The Good Doctor (from Korean public broadcaster KBS) and entertainment formats such as The Masked Singer (MBC) and I Can See Your Voice (CJ ENM) have travelled to all corners of the globe in recent years, either in their original form or as IP for local production.  Do Hyoung Lee, general director at the broadcasting division of the South Korean government\u2019s Korea Creative Content Agency (Kocca), says the origins of the K-format boom can be traced back to 11 years ago.  \u201cKorean formats started to get noticed in China in early 2010 and have since seen remarkable achievements in the global market,\u201d he says. \u201cFollowing the success of The Good Doctor and The Masked Singer, another K-entertainment show called I Can See Your Voice broadcast in the US on Fox and became the most watched programme among those on air in that time period.  \u201cThis achievement led to the BBC, the UK\u2019s public broadcaster, deciding to air its own adaptation of the show as its first ever Korean format.\u201d  According to Kocca data gathered from nine of South Korea\u2019s domestic broadcasters, 102 K-formats have been exported to 204 channels in 65 countries over the past decade. And these figures don\u2019t include subsequent seasons based on the same format.   \u201cThe influence of K-formats is getting bigger as they have been exported to markets that didn\u2019t import them before, such as North America and Europe, now accounting for 34% of format exports,\u201d Lee says.  \u201cThe proportion of sales now coming from outside Asia has increased from 25% to 48%,\u201d adds the exec, underscoring the impact of The Masked Singer and I Can See Your Voice.  But things have moved on from even these relatively recent titles, according to Lee. He speaks of a \u201cNew Korean Wave\u201d of 2020, the year when South Korean movie Parasite won four Oscars, for Best Picture, Best Directing, Best International Feature Film and Best Writing (Original Screenplay).   \u201cThe New Korean Wave has continued with Korea\u2019s TV content, particularly K-dramas. For example, Crash Landing on You was one of 2020\u2019s hottest dramas,\u201d Lee says. The series aired on CJ-owned cable channel TVN in South Korea and on Netflix worldwide, and has emerged as the highest-rated TVN drama ever and the third highest-rated South Korean TV drama in cable TV history.  \u201cFurthermore, Korean zombie movie #Alive was ranked number one on the Netflix global movie chart in the US, France and Australia, while K-pop documentary Blackpink: Light Up the Sky reached number six in its first week of streaming,\u201d adds Lee.  One factor driving the New Korean Wave is the growth of streaming platforms. Global players like Netflix have been busy commissioning Korean content, offering \u201clavish investment in production,\u201d says Lee, allowing shows from the country to reach \u201cnew limits.\u201d   Streamers have also allowed K-content to embrace certain themes and tones that wouldn\u2019t be allowed by traditional broadcasters in Korea. For instance, Netflix Korean original Extracurricular was \u201cthe drama touching Koreans\u2019 hearts the most in 2020,\u201d says Lee, but it could never have been produced for local broadcast or cinema release \u201cgiven its rating and shocking subject matter,\u201d the exec says.  Furthermore, apocalyptic horror Sweet Home, another Netflix Korean original series, \u201cclearly displays the hottest trends of Korea\u2019s recent TV content, such as the expansion of genres and subjects, new types of series blurring the line between TV dramas and movies, and global content based on super IP,\u201d says Lee.  Another consequence of the rise of streaming is increased demand for shortform and midform content. \u201cSince [South Korean streamer] Kakao TV and Netflix have recently presented more premium midform dramas with 20- or 30-minute episodes, like Daughter-in-Law and Lovestruck in the City, it is expected for shortform and midform to get more popular,\u201d Lee says.   Over the past few years, the keen-eyed might have also noticed a trend for K-dramas to be adapted from popular webtoons, particularly in the shape of the edgier series ordered by cable channels and streamers. Recent examples include Netflix\u2019s Love Alarm, Strangers from Hell, All of Us are Dead and Sweet Home; Itaewon Class on JTBC; Cheese in the Trap on TVN; and Extraordinary You on MBC.  \u201cIn the content industry, where the biggest deals are about obtaining IP, one of the most attractive products is obviously the webtoon,\u201d says Lee. \u201cThey have unique characters, fast-paced storylines and subjects appealing to the younger generation. Webtoons are the number-one choice of millennials, preferring this form of video and storytelling with no limitations to subject and content, which gives rise to strong fan communities.  \u201cPlus, under the current economic circumstances, a webtoon is regarded as one way of reducing risk. With a sharp eye for visualisation and editing, a webtoon is highly likely to get a greenlight for investment and production in 2021.   \u201cAnother attractive option is the web novel. There has been growing competition among platforms such as Kakao Page and Naver Series for the exclusive rights to web novels as the basis for webtoons, dramas and movies.\u201d  Korean content is certainly booming at the moment, driven in part by these new sources of IP, but the country isn\u2019t resting on its laurels and is instead reaching out to international buyers with new documentaries, dramas, entertainment formats, reality shows and animation.  \u201cSince the Covid-19 pandemic, online promotion and marketing has become ever more important. With fewer opportunities for finding new buyers, it has also been needed to increase the number of clients,\u201d says Lee. \u201cAgainst this background, Kocca has made efforts for companies looking to expand overseas exports by promoting them with major online media.\u201d   As such, for its Digital Screenings playlist, Kocca has \u201cselected shows based on their content competitiveness, their capacity for export and their willingness to promote overseas,\u201d Lee notes.  The playlist comprises 21 programmes from 16 South Korean companies. For buyers seeking factual fare, from public broadcaster KBS comes astronomy documentary 23.5 (4\u00d750\u2019), while the Korean/Italian/Brazilian coproduction The Pandemic (4\u00d760\u2019), from MBC, adds some Covid-19 topicality to the slate.  Other factual titles on the list include gender biology doc Love Machine (2\u00d750\u2019), from EBS; Back to the Books (4\u00d760\u2019), from Young & Contents; and wildlife series Chaser of Wildlife, CASAD (4\u00d752\u2019), from Wildtale.

South Korea is riding high in the entertainment format sector, and plenty of buyers around the world will be keen to check out the new K-formats on offer. Titles include survival show Law of the Jungle (436\u00d770\u2019), from SBS Contents Hub, and SBS K-Pop VR ZON (150\u00d75\u2019).

For buyers seeking entertainment content with a reality twist, check out Heart Signal, a suspenseful romance reality show from Channel A that follows the lives of eight housemates. The same broadcaster is also behind Good People, centring on eight law students chosen to work at a renowned law firm for a month.   On the scripted front is Penthouse S1: War in Life (21\u00d770\u2019), from SBS Contents Hub Co, while JTBC Studios has a remake of the BBC\u2019s Doctor Foster called The World of the Married (16\u00d770\u2019) available to license. JTBC Studios is also behind crime drama The Good Detective (16\u00d770\u2019) and Graceful Friends (17\u00d770\u2019), described as the Korean version of Desperate Housewives, this time with a male twist.  Fresh drama from Channel A includes telenovela Lie After Lie, while AK Entertainment\u2019s female-led web series Mensore can be presented as an 11\u00d712\u2019 series or a 1\u00d795\u2019 movie. With a more comedic tone, Bubble Up (10\u00d712\u2019) is another shortform web series, this time from Yoon & Company. Last, but by no means least, comes an animated series from Hong Dang Moo called Ppoppoppo Friends (100\u00d725\u2019), which has been a children\u2019s hit in South Korea for the past 40 years.

Extraordinary Attorney Woo, the latest drama phenomenon from South Korea, has transformed the fortunes of a local TV channel and is set to wow audiences at Mipcom.  Having spent the summer firmly planted in the global top 10 of Netflix\u2019s most watched non-English-language originals, Extraordinary Attorney Woo has lived up to its name since launching on ENA in South Korea in June.  The series has delivered the Skylife-owned satellite channel\u2019s highest ever ratings, transforming its fortunes overnight since it debuted. Extraordinary Attorney Woo is also the seventh highest-rated drama in Korean cable television history and the sixth highest-rated TV drama by the number of viewers, with a final episode that pulled in almost 4.5 million viewers in August.  Starring Park Eun-bin, the show follows a rookie female attorney with autism spectrum disorder who is hired by a major law firm in Seoul. Being different from her neurotypical peers, her manner of communication is seen by them as odd, awkward and blunt. However, with each legal case and through her intelligence and photographic memory, she becomes an increasingly competent attorney.\nREAD MORE Jessie K.M Jeong, vice president and chief operating officer at South Korean cultural export agency KOCCA, looks ahead to the upcoming BCWW event in Seoul and explores trends in the production and distribution of K-content.

South Korean drama has been a global phenomenon for many years now, with wave after wave of hit shows spreading out from Asia and reaching the US and Europe in recent years.  But things have certainly moved on from the good old days of Winter Sonata, the KBS hit that put Korean drama on the global map almost 20 years ago. Things have changed even from the more recent crossover hits like The Good Doctor, another KBS show from 2013 that was successfully adapted for ABC in the US in 2017 and travelled the globe.  Since then, the streaming boom \u2013 both within South Korea and internationally \u2013 has changed the landscape for Korean drama in a number of ways. Over to Do Hyoung Lee, general director of broadcasting at South Korean cultural agency Kocca, to explain how.  \u201cThe popularity of Korean drama has continued globally this year, just as it did in 2020,\u201d he says. \u201cAs competition has been getting more fierce among domestic and foreign online streaming services, such as Netflix, Disney+, Wavve and TVing, demand for Korean drama has increased and there has been more investment in production. This trend has stimulated the diversity of Korean drama.\u201d\nREAD MORE South Korean governmental agency Korea Creative Content Agency (KOCCA), which oversees and coordinates the promotion of the Korean content industry, is this week showcasing new content from the country via C21 Digital Screenings, while general director Dohyoung Lee gives his analysis of the international boom in K-content.  Exports of South Korean television content have been on a steady upward curve ever since the early days of the Korean Wave almost 20 years ago, when dramas like KBS2\u2019s 2002 hit Winter Sonata made such an impact on the global market.  Fast forward to today and more of the world is watching even more K-content. Just look at some of the biggest US shows in recent years. ABC\u2019s adaptation of another KBS2 series, The Good Doctor, was the only global hit coming out of the 2017/18 season in the US. And on the unscripted side, the global success of talent show The Masked Singer has been a phenomenon over the past two years, following its debut on Fox in the US in 2019.  Dohyoung Lee, general director at the Broadcasting Division of KOCCA, is certain these two recent K-content hits have driven demand for more programming from South Korea.\nREAD MORE ",
