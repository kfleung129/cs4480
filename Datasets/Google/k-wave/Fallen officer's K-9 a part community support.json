    "text": "BARDSTOWN, KY (WAVE) - A fallen officer's loyal companion is in the spotlight of the Bardstown\u00a0 community's continuous support. Officer Jason Ellis' family adopted his retired K-9 Figo following the officer's death. A friend of the family approached the Bluegrass Barkery, located in Lexington, about putting together a special way to support the dog as well as Ellis' widow Amy Ellis, and their two children Hunter and Parker Ellis. Bluegrass Barkery Owner Clayton Harvey explained, \"The family is going through so much all ready that we wanted to think of anything we could do to kind of ease that suffering, that pain, that stress.\" Organizers are working with pet food companies to provide long term food and they're putting together a walk to cover his vet bills so the Ellis family doesn't have to worry about the cost of keeping him. A Facebook page called Friends of Figo has been set up to help raise funds and assist with the dog's care. To visit the page, click here. Copyright 2013 WAVE News. All rights reserved. ",
