SEOUL \u2014 Rounder eyes, narrower faces, bigger breasts: A South Korean girlband is celebrating the country\u2019s obsession with surgically-enhanced beauty by going under the knife to praise the virtues of \u201cBecoming Pretty\u201d. All four members of obscure K-pop outfit SixBomb went through extensive plastic surgery, from nose jobs to breast implants, before releasing their new single on Thursday (March 16). A series of videos showed the four women visiting a clinic, strutting into an operating theatre and lying on the operating table. Another had them practising dance moves in sunglasses with their heads wrapped in bandages. \u201cEveryone follows me, they know I\u2019m pretty,\u201d they sing in \u201cBecoming Pretty\u201d \u2013 an electronic dance number with a hook reminiscent of South Korean singer Psy\u2019s 2012 global phenomenon Gangnam Style. The track could be the direct antithesis to Lady Gaga\u2019s Born This Way, lyrics: \u201cI\u2019m beautiful in my way/Cause God makes no mistakes/I\u2019m on the right track, baby/I was born this way.\u201d It has raised questions over the South\u2019s ultra-competitive, looks-obsessed society, where physical features enhance social standing and can help secure jobs, with many recruitment adverts requiring a \u201cneat appearance\u201d and a CV with photo. Despite a population of only 50 million, it is the world\u2019s third biggest plastic surgery market, with thousands of clinics performing an estimated 1.2 million procedures a year. Adverts showing dramatic before-and-after pictures are omnipresent on street billboards, subway trains, bus stops and toilet walls, urging women to \u201cchange\u201d their lives or admonishing them: \u201cEveryone but you has done it.\u201d \u2018COME OUT OF THE CLOSET\u2019 SixBomb\u2019s lead singer Dain had her breasts enlarged and her cheekbones shaved to make her face look smaller for the song. \u201cWe all wanted to get some surgeries done to look prettier... and thought, \u2018Why not perform a song about it instead of trying to conceal it?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cPeople will notice it anyway... so we wanted to be open about this reality where many women want to look pretty,\u201d she told AFP. SixBomb were founded in 2012 and have released five albums, but have yet to become major stars and with their members now in their mid-20s, time could be running out for them in a youth-driven market. The project was funded by their management, which spent 100 million won (around S$124,000) for \u201calmost every kind of surgery that could be done on a face\u201d and breast implants, said head manager Kim Il-woong. \u201cWe haven\u2019t committed any crimes. Our only crime would be talking about it in such an open manner,\u201d he said, adding many celebrities go under the knife but do not \u201ccome out of the closet\u201d. KOREAN WAVE K-pop has conquered much of Asia and spread beyond it in a \u201cKorean Wave\u201d, with top girl- and boybands, their good looks often surgically perfected and performing dance moves with military precision, enjoying huge followings. Many are tightly controlled by their managements, who dictate everything from what songs to sing, to what to eat \u2013 or not \u2013 to maintain rail-thin figures, and what operations to have. Their popularity has itself fuelled the surgery business, with many fans \u2013 including from overseas, particularly Chinese \u2013 having procedures in the hope of looking like their favourite stars. A prominent Seoul clinic confirmed that SixBomb\u2019s members had gone through extensive operations \u201call above the waist\u201d. None of the four were forced to go through surgery, they said, although rapper Soa had to think \u201clong and hard\u201d before having the \u201cdouble eyelid\u201d procedure to make eyes wider and rounder. \u201cI really liked and was satisfied with my previous eyes, so I had to think long and hard before deciding to take part in this concept,\u201d Soa said. \u2018WORSHIPPED AND CONSUMED\u2019 The stunt has raised eyebrows. \u201cI understand that you guys are desperate for publicity... but did you really need to go this far?\u201d asked one online commentator, while another described it \u201cflat-out bizarre\u201d. The move is emblematic of the \u201cplastic surgery culture\u201d prevalent in a country which ranks at the bottom of OECD surveys on gender equality despite being Asia\u2019s fourth-largest economy, said Ms Jung Seul-ah, media monitor at rights group Korea Womenlink. Looks often play a key role in South Korean women\u2019s \u201csocial survival\u201d and job prospects, Ms Jung said. \u201cThis culture has made plastic surgery something essential for many women deemed not pretty enough,\u201d Ms Jung said, and an \u201cabsolute necessity for female celebrities whose looks are worshipped, consumed and capitalised on incessantly\u201d. But for her part, singer Dain had no doubts. \u201cI really love my new face and am proud of how good I look on TV screens,\u201d she said, adding she would welcome \u201cany kind of public attention, good or bad\u201d for the project.
