When employees started looking at the security video from that period they saw Gilbert in the room where the missing equipment was stored and using his key card to leave the building with the equipment. Gilbert was then seen re-entering the building using his key card, going back into the room and leaving the building with more equipment. The warrant says Gilbert suddenly quit several days later.
