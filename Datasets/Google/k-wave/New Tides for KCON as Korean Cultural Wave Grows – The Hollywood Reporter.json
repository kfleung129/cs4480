However, with K-pop's exponential growth, the convention now finds itself having to share the spotlight with Korean groups launching their own North American tours. By \n\n\tSara Merican Outside the Los Angeles Convention Center on Aug. 18, fans gathered for spontaneous dance sessions, while others handed out homemade fan art, posters and photo cards featuring their favorite pop stars. A little further down, around 20 food trucks lined a street, selling Korean and fusion fare: rice cakes tossed in red chili pepper paste, barbecued meat smoking on grills in the sweltering late-afternoon heat. Downtown L.A. was flooded with all things Korean last weekend, as a record-breaking 103,000 fans congregated for KCON LA. The hybrid convention-concert celebrating K-pop, which this year expanded to four days, started in 2012 with around 10,000 fans turning out for a one-day symposium in L.A. What seemed like a niche subculture back then has now morphed into a global cultural phenomenon, with sold-out international concerts, legions of fans, highly active online communities, and social media engagement rates that far surpass acts like Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift. CJ ENM, the Korean conglomerate behind KCON, has now expanded the conventions to New York and beyond \u2014 Mexico, Australia, Japan, Thailand, among others.

When Girls\u2019 Generation was on David Letterman [in 2012], it was the biggest deal in the world. Now [even more] groups are doing all these shows. The door has finally broken down.\u201d With this exponential growth, however, KCON now finds itself having to share the spotlight. Previously, it served as the prime destination in the United States for Korean groups to perform and break into the North American market, but numerous bands have since launched their own North American tours in the past few years. For example, it was at KCON in 2014 that BTS held its first official stateside performance; this May, it topped Billboard\u2018s monthly Boxscore chart with the top-grossing tour, selling out shows in stadiums worldwide, including the Rose Bowl, New York\u2019s Citi Field\u00a0and London\u2019s Wembley Stadium. Meanwhile, this year, girl group BLACKPINK performed at Coachella, while next month\u2019s iHeartRadio Music Festival will feature Korean male group MONSTA X.  There is perhaps no better illustration of the genre\u2019s proliferation than the fact that the same weekend that KCON LA was happening at the L.A. Convention Center and Staples Center, just 3.5 miles away, upstart Asian hip-hop festival Head in the Clouds was taking place at the L.A. State Historic Park. The one-day event, presented by label and management company 88Rising, is in its second year and featured a mix of underground global Asian artists like Dumbfoundead and Rich Brian with K-pop artists such as iKON and GOT7 member Jackson Wang. Chun adds, \u201cYou would never expect that they could do two big festivals at one time. So it\u2019s growing, for sure.\u201d KCON digital media manager Vanessa Augsbach notes another change in the K-pop landscape: Bands are globally focused from the beginning. For example, ATEEZ and TXT (the latter is under the same label as BTS, Big Hit Entertainment) toured in the U.S. almost within a year of their debuts. \u201cIn 2012, it was unthinkable for a new band to immediately go on an international tour,\u201d she says, adding that she does not see these individual artist tours in America as competition for KCON, but instead as a healthy part of the K-pop ecosystem. \u201cHaving so many concerts grows our fan base, the number of people who would be interested in going to an event like KCON.\u201d Indeed, with rising attendance each year \u2014 including its KCON New York edition, which began in 2015 and saw an unprecedented 53,000 attendees last month \u2014 KCON is not facing a diminished relevance but instead a different one. \u201cThese acts that used to be on KCON are doing their own world tours,\u201d says Warner Records A&R consultant Eddie Nam, who is founder and CEO of L.A.-based EN Management, which reps Eric Nam (his brother), Epik High and Tablo. \u201cI don\u2019t think that diminishes what KCON\u2019s impact is. Because it\u2019s not just even about the music side. They have a whole convention side, a community and all that.\u201d  This year\u2019s edition\u00a0featured boy bands like SEVENTEEN and Stray Kids, as well as female groups like MAMAMOO and ITZY. The list of performers and bands chosen for each KCON is based off of data indicating interest and popularity, gleaned from tens of thousands of official KCON survey responses submitted each year. Organizers say that almost half of KCON LA attendees hail from outside Southern California, with only 7 percent from Los Angeles itself. Most are female, with around two-third under age 24. Around a quarter of attendees are white, 19 percent are Hispanic and 42 percent Asian American (with a large proportion of Chinese and Filipino descent). The convention also featured fan meet-ups, artist engagement sessions, panels on K-pop and mental health and beauty workshops. \u201cThe way they scaled, kept the level up, expanded into different cities, really shows the power of K-pop and how international it has become. You can look at it as a cornerstone of this industry and of the live-touring industry for sure.\u201d Nam says. \u201cThink about how many important people come \u2014 curious managers, A&Rs and agents \u2014 because they are like, I need to see what this is about. When they see 15,000 to 20,000 screaming fans for hours, I\u2019m sure they just see huge opportunities\u2026.
