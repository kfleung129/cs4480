The two companies first began working together in 1968 and this week owners\u00a0Alfred T Ritter and Claus and Gunnar Heinemann have paid tribute to the close working relationship between the two family-owned companies. It is a relationship which has helped Heinemann to record its highest ever sales in Frankfurt, Istanbul, Amsterdam and Hong Kong. But as they look to the future the brands are planning to develop their offering further. For next year Ritter Sport will release its first inflight exclusive product, Play with Me. The set of four minis and a small game provides both snacks and entertainment for travellers in mid-air.  \u201cFor us, Gebr Heinemann is a reliable and effective partner in the travel retail sector and we have achieved growth together,\u201d Ritter enthused. \u201cThe company has supported us in our efforts to become more established in the travel retail sector. The global structure and the international retail expertise of Gebr Heinemann offer the basis for this.\u201d Ritter Sport began creating travel retail exclusives in 2007 and next year the brand will add to its line with a 397g Choco Cubes bag and Chocolate World, a collection of four 16g minis. The new products are an example of how the companies are \u201cjointly facing the growing challenges in the travel retail market with special products and innovative campaigns.\u201d \u201cIn an increasingly competitive international business environment made up of major corporations, our two family businesses provide evidence that [companies] with traditional values can still be successful as global players,\u201d said Claus Heinemann.  \u201cThis maxim has now bound our two companies together for five decades and has proven profitable for both parties.\u201d His cousin Gunnar added: \u201cWhether small or large, crunchily chocolatey, crispy, fruity or nutty \u2013 I have loved the wide variety of chocolate squares since I was a child. The brightly coloured bars have occupied a permanent place in my life ever since.  \u201cSo I am particularly delighted to note that Ritter Sport\u2019s chocolate creations have also occupied a permanent place in our product range for half a century.\u201d The brands say that a \u201ctransparent exchange of information\u201d is at the heart of their success and believe their union enables both solid growth prospects and stronger openings in new markets.
