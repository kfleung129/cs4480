By seeding a weak probe field into the Stokes or anti-Stokes channel of the FWM, the gain processes are generated in the bright twin beams which are called conjugate and probe beams, respectively. However, the strong dressing effect of the pump beam will dramatically affect the gain factors both in the probe and conjugate channels and can inevitably impose an influence on the quantum effects such as entangled degree and the quantum noise reduction between the two channels. We systematically investigate the intensity evolution of the dressed gain processes by manipulating the atomic density, the Rabi frequency and the frequency detuning. Such dressing effects are also visually evidenced by the observation of Autler-Townes splitting of the gain peaks. The investigation can contribute to the development of quantum information processing and quantum communications. The parametric four-wave mixing (FWM) process based on atomic coherence1,2,3 plays important roles in the squeezed and entangled states of optical fields4,5,6,7 as well as the high-order cascaded nonlinear optical process8,9. For the cascaded-nonlinearity process in an atomic system, the FWM process can serve as a low-noise linear phase-insensitive or phase-sensitive amplifier10,11 with easily adjustable parameters. Moreover, with the introduction of the squeezed state based on FWM process12,13, the progresses in the squeezing of light involve in various applications such as the generation of the multi-spatial-mode entangled beams14,15,16 and continuous-variable quantum images processing17,18,19. In recent years, the non-degenerate FWM process driven by a strong pump beam in a coherent \u201cdouble-\u039b\u201d atomic system without the disturbance of a cavity is demonstrated to generate strong relative intensity squeezing between the bright twin beams named as probe and conjugate20,21. Also, the diamond-type four-level configuration22,23,24,25 with a stable ground state, two intermediate levels and an upper state in an atomic system is also developed to study non-degenerated FWM process at the wavelength for telecommunication26,27. Compared with the diamond-type configuration (5S1/2, 5P1/2, 5P3/2 and 6S1/2) in a rubidium vapor, the \u201cdouble-\u039b\u201d system can be more efficient due to the low requirement on phase matching condition (PMC). For the FWM process characterized as large nonlinearity at near resonance and reduced the excess noise15 in the \u201cdouble-\u039b\u201d system, the probe and conjugate beams can be both amplified and then induce the generation of a pair of strongly correlated Stokes and anti-Stokes fields28 with high efficiency, which can produce squeezed states with narrow bandwidth and low frequency20,29. Actually, the parametrically amplified factor in the FWM process can directly determine the squeezing level of the two bright beams15,17. In this article, we demonstrate the parametrically amplified FWM (PA-FWM) process with dressing effects in an off-resonant \u201cdouble-\u039b\u201d arrangement by establishing a forward cone30 in a thermal rubidium atomic vapor both theoretically and experimentally. On one hand, with the weak probe beam seeded into the Stokes or anti-Stokes channel in the FWM process generated from the strong pump beam, the gain processes can be obtained in both the conjugate and probe channels. On the other hand, with the pump filed considered as a coupling or dressing field, the classical electromagnetically induced absorption (EIA)31 is also observed in the probe channel. As a result, the EIA effect can interact and compete with the gain process in the probe field, which can inevitably render the change of squeezing state as well as the amplification factor. Such interaction and competition are investigated by the signal intensity evolution dependences of the dressed gain on the atomic density, the Rabi frequency and the frequency detuning of the pump laser. As a consequence, we can control quantum effects as well as the amplification factor in the FWM process by easily manipulating the corresponding parameters. The fundamental study on the dressed gain of the bright twin beams can be effectively conducive to the development of quantum information processing such as entangled images and the generation of correlated photons source as well as squeezing states. A three-level \u201cdouble-\u039b\u201d type 85Rb atomic system, consisting of two hyperfine states F\u2009=\u20093 (|0\u3009) and F\u2009=\u20092 (|3\u3009) of the ground state 5S1/2 and an excited state 5P3/2 (|1\u3009), is used to generate the PA-FWM process. Two laser beams derived from a Ti:sapphire laser and an external cavity diode laser (ECDL) are coupled into the corresponding transitions as shown in Fig. 1(a). The spatial beams alignment is shown in Fig. 1(b). With the laser frequency tuned to the D2 line transition of rubidium atoms, the strong pump beam E1 (frequency \u03c91, wave vector k1, Rabi frequency G1, vertical polarization) up to 500\u2009mW is coupled into the cell by a polarizing beam splitter (PBS). The weak probe beam E2 (\u03c92, k2, G2, horizontal polarization) with approximately 100\u2009\u03bcW propagates in the same direction of E1 with an angle of 0.26\u00b0 and is detected by a branch of a balanced homodyne photodiode detector. The generated conjugate signal that can establish the coherence between the two ground states |0\u3009 and |1\u3009 co-propagates withE2 symmetrically with respect to E1 and is received by the other branch of the balanced detector.

(b3) Measured Stokes field ESt and (b4) anti-Stokes field EASt versus the pump frequency in the FWM process. (c1,c2) Measured probe transmission signal and corresponding conjugate signal versus the probe frequency detuning \u03942, respectively. With the frequency detuning of E1 tuned far away from the resonance, the FWM process will occur in the \u201cdouble-\u039b\u201d configuration, which can generate the Stokes field ESt and anti-Stokes field EASt (satisfying the PMCs kSt\u2009=\u20092k1\u2009\u2212\u2009kASt and kASt\u2009=\u20092k1\u2009\u2212\u2009kSt, respectively) on the forward cone shown in Fig. 1(b2). Here the detuning \u0394i\u2009=\u2009\u03a9i\u2009\u2212\u2009\u03c9i is defined as the difference between the resonant transition frequency \u03a9i and the laser frequency \u03c9i of Ei. The detected ESt and EASt signals (via perturbation chains  and  by means of the Liouville pathway32) are shown in Fig. 1(b3,b4), respectively. Here the corresponding third-order density matrix elements and can be described as where Gi\u2009=\u2009\u03bcijEij/\u0127 (i, j\u2009=\u20091, 2, conj, St, ASt) is the Rabi frequency between levels |i\u3009\u2009\u2194\u2009|j\u3009 and \u03bcij is the dipole momentum; d20\u2009=\u2009\u03b320\u2009+\u2009i\u03941, d21\u2009=\u2009\u03b321\u2009+\u2009i\u03941, d10\u2009=\u2009\u03b310\u2009+\u2009i(\u03941\u2009\u2212\u2009\u0394St), , , ; \u0393ij is the nature decay rate between levels |i\u3009 and |j\u3009 and \u03b3ij\u2009=\u2009(\u0393i\u2009+\u2009\u0393j)/2 is the decoherence rate between levels |i\u3009 and |j\u3009. The presence of the weak probe beam E2 can be viewed as being injected into the Stokes or anti-Stokes port of the FWM process and the injection will serve as an optical parametric amplification (OPA) process (with PMC kASt\u2009=\u20092k1\u2009\u2212\u2009k2 or kSt\u2009=\u20092k1\u2009\u2212\u2009k2) assisted by the cascaded nonlinear process. With the perturbation chains rewritten as  and , Eqs (1 and 2) should be modified as As a result, the input probe beam with a intensity of P2 is amplified to produce an output probe with a intensity of gP2 and an output conjugate with a intensity of (g\u20131)P2. See Methods for the theoretical derivations of the gain factor g. Taking the dressing effects of E1 and E2 into consideration, the expression for the Stokes and conjugate anti-Stokes fields should be written as Also, with E2 and E1 viewed as probe and coupling fields, respectively, the first-order density matrix  for the probe transmission signal with dressing effect is Consequently, the intensity Ip of the probe signal with gain and dressing effect can be expressed by  and  for transitions F\u2009=\u20093\u2009\u2192\u2009F\u2032 and F\u2009=\u20092\u2009\u2192\u2009F\u2032, respectively, where I0 is the intensity of the probe field without Doppler absorption. By experimentally scanning the probe detuning over 16\u2009GHz across the D2 line, we obtain the featured transmission signal and corresponding conjugate signal as shown in Fig. 1(c1,c2), respectively. The observed character in the probe channel can be attributed to Raman absorption, EIA effect, parametrical amplification process and the combined dressing effects. The absorptive dip at \u03942\u2009=\u2009\u22123.5\u2009GHz has a linewidth of 278.5\u2009MHz and is caused by Raman absorption on 87Rb, F\u2009=\u20092\u2009\u2192\u2009F\u2032. The dip at \u03942\u2009=\u20094.5\u2009GHz indicates the detuning of the pump field. The most prominent points are the Stokes and anti-Stokes gain peaks at the 85Rb ground-state hyperfine states (\u03942\u2009=\u20091.2\u2009GHz and 7.2\u2009GHz, respectively). According to the experimental condition, there exists 6\u2009GHz frequency gap between the Stokes and anti-Stokes signals in the probe channel. The seeding process can also generate the anti-Stokes and Stokes peaks in the conjugate channel corresponding to the Stokes and anti-Stokes in the probe channel, respectively. The Stokes (F\u2009=\u20093\u2009\u2192\u2009F\u2032) in the probe channel and the corresponding anti-Stokes in the conjugate channel are strongly correlated, so do the anti-Stoke (F\u2009=\u20092\u2009\u2192\u2009F\u2032) of the probe and Stokes of the conjugate. Figure 2(a,b) show the Stokes (85Rb, F\u2009=\u20093\u2009\u2192\u2009F\u2032 transition) and anti-Stokes (85Rb, F\u2009=\u20092\u2009\u2192\u2009F\u2032 transition) signal evolutions in the probe channel by varying the atomic intensity, respectively. The single Stokes signal profile in Fig. 2(a) obviously consists of an EIA dip with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 101.7\u2009MHz and a gain peak with a FWHM of 32.4\u2009MHz. Here, the sharp gain peak is caused by seeding E1 into the Stokes port of the FWM process and the gain intensity is related to the generated photon number described by Eq. (11) in Methods part. The EIA dip reveals the dressing effects when E1 and E2 beams are viewed as coupling and probe fields, respectively. The single anti-Stokes peak with a FWHM of 50.8\u2009MHz in Fig. 2(b) also results from the injection of E2 beam, which can be attributed to the amplification process in Eq. (10) related to F\u2009=\u20092\u2009\u2192\u2009F\u2032 transition. Intensity evolutions of the Stokes (a) and anti-stokes (b) gain peaks in the probe channel versus \u03942 by increasing the 85Rb atomic density. The atomic density is about 3\u2009\u00d7\u20091013\u2009cm\u22123 at 120\u2009\u00b0C. The dotted lines are guides for eyes. The measured intensity of the Stokes gain by increasing the atomic density in Fig. 2(a) is first getting larger and then smaller, which demonstrates the competition between the atomic dynamics process and the propagation of the FWM process. At the lower atomic density (105\u2009\u00b0C\u2013115\u2009\u00b0C), the gain directly proportional to the atomic density is dominated by the increase of the thermal motion of the atoms, while the absorption of FWM is small. With the density continuing to grow (115\u2009\u00b0C\u2013125\u2009\u00b0C), the atomic dynamics process and the absorption can achieve a balance and the signal intensity remains almost unchanged. When the temperature is over 125\u2009\u00b0C, the decrease of the gain can be attributed to the fact that the absorption of the FWM during its propagation is increasing while the atomic motion gets saturated at high atomic density, namely, the absorption can be dominant. The varying tendency of the anti-Stokes peak in Fig. 2(b) is similar to that of the Stokes peak described previously. The EIA depth in Fig. 2(a) described with term  can experience growing, unchanged and getting smaller by increasing the atomic density. The first growth and saturation can be attributed to the dominated dressing effects caused by G2 and G1 and the subsequent weakening is similarly due to the strengthening of the Doppler effect. Figure 3(a1,a2) are the dressed Stokes and Anti-Stokes signals, respectively, from the probe output by growing the power of pump field with the conjugate detection branch blocked. For the Stokes signal, the peak represents the gain intensity and the dip is the classical EIA intensity. According to Eq. (3), the gain peak should increase with the square of pump Rabi frequency G1. At small E1 power (P1), the gain can increase with G1, which is observed in Fig. 3(a1) with P1 changing from 30\u2009mW to 90\u2009mW. However, due to the strong dressing effects caused by denominator terms  and  in Eq. (5), the peak can then be suppressed when P1 is getting larger. Also, the EIA dip can be deepened due to the increase of G1 as described by Eq. (7). For the anti-Stokes in Fig. 3(a2), the dressing effects are weak with \u03941 being far away from the resonance. Consequently, the anti-Stokes gain described by Eq. (4) can increase with G1 and the gain can also be much stronger than that in Fig. 3(a1).

The dotted lines are guides for eyes. (d1,d4) Simulated lineshapes correspond to the signals in (a1,a2,b1,b2), respectively. The theoretical simulations in (e1,e2) agree well with the experimental observations. The squares, triangles and dots represent the original experimental observations of corresponding signals and the solid curves are the theoretical predictions. The anti-Stokes and Stokes signals that are conjugate to the two gain peaks in the probe channel are shown in Fig. 3(b1,b2), respectively. Physically, the two pairs of generated Stokes and anti-Stokes signals by scanning the probe detuning are correlated in frequency and space, so the measured anti-Stokes and Stokes signals in the conjugate channel should behave similarly to the corresponding signals in the probe channel. However, due to the absence of directly dressing effect, both the intensities of Stokes and anti-Stokes in the conjugate channel can grow with G1, which are depicted in Fig. 3(b1,b2) and can be explained by Eqs (3 and 4), respectively. With the twin branches of the detector turned on, Fig. 3(c1,c2) are the measured intensity difference evolutions on F\u2009=\u20093\u2009\u2192\u2009F\u2032 and F\u2009=\u20092\u2009\u2192\u2009F\u2032 transitions with different G1, respectively. Figure 3(d1,d2,d3 and d4) are the simulated lineshapes for the Stokes and anti-Stokes in the probe channel and anti-Stokes and Stokes in the conjugate channel. The theoretical curves in Fig. 3(e1,e2) agree well with the experimental results. Figure 4(a1,a2) are the Stokes and anti-Stokes measured from the probe channel at different \u03941, respectively. Since the horizontal positions of the two gain peaks on the probe signal can move with the pump detuning changing, the probe detuning values \u03942 in Fig. 4 can directly depict the change of \u03941, which can also be consistent with the coordinate probe detuning shown in Fig. 1(c1). The peaks in Fig. 4(a,b) should be the highest near \u03942\u2009=\u20090 and \u03942\u2009=\u20096\u2009GHz, respectively, due to the improved nonlinearity caused by the strong coherence in the FWM process at resonance. Similarly, the EIA and dressing effects can also be strengthened, which in turn can impose stronger suppression on the gain peaks. As a result of the interaction, the gain peak can have the almost unchanged intensity with \u03941 varying from \u03942\u2009=\u2009\u2212200\u2009MHz to 200\u2009MHz. The optimum choice of pump detuning \u03941 should be a balance between the increasing of gain and reduction of the dressing effect as well as the probe loss with \u03941 tuned close to the atomic line. By blocking the probe detection branch, the corresponding anti-Stokes and Stokes are received from the non-injected channel and demonstrated in Fig. 4(b1,b2), respectively. According to Eqs (5 and 6), the third-order polarization or  at \u03941>0 decreases with the increase of \u03941 with G1\u2009\u226b\u2009G2 and G1\u2009\u226b\u2009Gc considered, which can also interpret the height evolutions of the observed gain peaks well. The intensity difference changes between the probe and conjugate signals at different \u03941 are shown in Fig. 4(c1,c2). Figure 4(d) provides the images of the probe and conjugate beam for F\u2009=\u20092\u2009\u2192\u2009F\u2032 transition at different \u03941. The right image and left image in each picture are the probe signal and conjugate signal and visually demonstrate the signal intensity evolutions corresponding to Fig. 4(a2,b2), respectively. The strong signal image in the middle of each picture with almost unchanged intensity are the residual transmission of the pump beam (vertical polarization) after the polarizing beam splitter (PBS).

The squares, triangles and dots are the original experimental observations of corresponding signals and the solid curves are the theoretical predictions. So far, we have presented the PA-FWM process with dressing effects assisted by the cascaded-nonlinearity process in a \u201cdouble-\u039b\u201d 85Rb atomic system both theoretically and experimentally. With the parametrically FWM process established, we can obtain bright twin beams with gain by seeding a weak probe beam into the Stokes or anti-Stokes channel of the FWM process. Also, the dressing effects of the strong pump, the weak probe and the generated conjugate fields can impose influences on the probe gain and the conjugate gain. As an extension to our discussion, we present another powerful evidence for the dressing effects on the gain processes. To be specific, the observed Autler-Townes (AT) splitting27 on the gain peaks shown in Fig. 5 can be attributed to the interaction between the gain processes and the combined dressing effects. AT splitting of the Stokes (a) and anti-stokes (b) gain peaks in the probe channel versus \u03942 by varying the pump detuning \u03941. (a1,b1) Theoretical predictions corresponding to (a,b), respectively. The dotted lines are guides for eyes. Figure 5(a,b) are the observed AT splitting of the gain processes on 85Rb, F\u2009=\u20093\u2009\u2192\u2009F\u2032 and 85Rb, F\u2009=\u20092\u2009\u2192\u2009F\u2032, respectively, by varying the detuning of pump field. Similarly to Fig. 4, the probe detuning \u03942 in Fig. 5 can also reflect the pump detuning \u03941. When the single-peak gain in Fig. 5 is split into two peaks, the AT splitting caused by the combined dressing effects is obtained. The AT splitting effect in Fig. 5(a) firstly appears at \u03942\u2009=\u20090.05\u2009GHz and then the intensities of left and right peaks can change with \u03941, which means that the strong pump laser starts to dress the energy levels |1\u3009 and |2\u3009 to create corresponding primary dressing states33 |1+\u3009\u2009&\u2009|1\u2212\u3009 and |2+\u3009\u2009&\u2009|2\u2212\u3009, respectively. The two dressing state effects can be described by perturbation chains  and , respectively. Such dressing effect with the participation of the two third-order nonlinear processes can dress the involved energy levels, which can then affect the third-order Stokes and anti-Stokes signals themselves. The measured left and right peaks in the Stokes gain in Fig. 5(a) correspond to the dress states |2+\u3009 and |2\u2212\u3009, respectively. With \u03941 tuned close to the dress state |2+\u3009, the left peak is much higher than the right one. Similarly, the right peak can be enhanced with \u03941 tuned close to |2\u2212\u3009. Considering the parallel generation process for the anti-Stokes, the dressing states |1+\u3009 and |1\u2212\u3009 can also explain the evolution from single peak to double peaks in Fig. 5(b) well. The theoretical simulation results in Fig. 5(a1,b1) agree well with the observed results in Fig. 5(a,b), respectively. With the interaction between the dressing state effects and gain processes systematically investigated by the intensity dependences of the dressed gain on the atomic density, the Rabi frequency and the frequency detuning, we can control the amplification factor in the FWM process by easily manipulating the corresponding parameters. Furthermore, the current study on controlling the dressed gain of the bright twin beams can have contribution to the development of entangled images and the generation of correlated photons source as well as squeezing states. We use two light beams from a continuous-wave Ti:sapphire laser and an ECDL to couple the three-level \u201cdouble-\u039b\u201d rubidium atomic system. The strong pump laser beam E1 and the weak probe beam E2 have diameters of 0.7\u2009mm and 0.4\u2009mm respectively. The pump beam with vertical polarization is first coupled into the cell by use of a polarizing beam splitter (PBS) and then separated from the detection path via another PBS cube after the cell. The probe beam propagates in the same direction of E1 with an angle of 0.26\u00b0 and intersects with the pump beam at the center inside the cell with natural abundance. The 10\u2009mm long rubidium cell with Brewster\u2019s angle is wrapped by \u03bc-metal and heated by the heater tape. The weak probe and the generated conjugate beam are received by a balanced phtotodetector with 105\u2009V/A transimpedance gain and \u224882% quantum efficiency. For the case of the FWM process without seeding, the generated twin-photon numbers of the Stokes and anti-Stokes channels that are proportional to the signal intensity can be shown as where  is the boson-creation operator of ESt (EASt) and  is the gain with the modulus A and B (phase angles \u03c61 and \u03c62) defined in  and  for ESt and EASt, respectively. Here the amplification factors are the same for the two output ports of the amplifier without seeding. When the weak probe field is injected into the Stokes port of the FWM process, it can amplify the seeded signal in an appropriate condition. The photon numbers of the output Stokes and anti-Stokes fields in the amplification process with injection are described as How to cite this article: Zhang, Z. et al.
