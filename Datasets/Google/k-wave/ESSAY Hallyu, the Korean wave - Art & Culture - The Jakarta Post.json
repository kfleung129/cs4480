South Korea has multiple five-year plans. If you want to make changes, the change has to be drastic. One example is the internet. Spreading Korean culture was dependent on the internet and so the government subsidized internet access throughout the country. But as Hong further explains, it was not just the government that had five-year plans; private enterprises have them too.\nA Korean entertainment company or record label will invest through training of their future stars. Take the EXO members, for example. They all had to go through a training period of five to seven years before their debut. Training was like going to school. They learn to sing and dance, they learn etiquette, they study languages, and most importantly they learn to bond until a firm brotherhood (or sisterhood for the girl bands) has been established before they go public.\nCan our entertainment industry learn from them too? If you remember in the mid-2000s there was this craze of Indonesian Idol and Akademi Fantasi. Newly discovered singers became overnight superstars, starting from television-reality shows and off-screen performances. But where are they now? A few were able to maintain popularity for a couple of months, but then they disappeared. The only preparation they had was a few weeks\u2019 quarantine before their show with the risk of being eliminated afterwards. Compare this with Koreans idols who spent years being trainees (and yes, that\u2019s the term used in Korea) without public exposure.\nNow what about Korean dramas? K-drama is certainly not of the same quality as sinetron. Story lines can be sentimental, with tales of love triangles and tearjerking scenes, but characters are well-developed as not being black and white.\nThey knew how to arouse our emotions and heat up our curiosity towards the ending of the series. But apart from the story lines, Korean dramas are also designed as a tool to advance their soft power. It is not enough to bring Korean culture to the world, but Korea also needs to understand how the world moves.\nThe Korean Cultural Trade Commission published a handbook Hallyu Forever (in Korean), which is a well-researched guide on how to approach world markets, paying attention to socioeconomic, political and cultural factors of each region. A chapter on the Arab world, for example, points out the importance of keeping Muslim praying times in mind. Thus TV stations should avoid airing drama programs during these moments. One historical drama The Jewel in the Palace was so popular in Iran, that on the other hand Iranians also organized their mealtimes as not to interfere with the show\u2019s broadcast time.\nThe best thing about popular culture is knowing that it is not shallow at all. In fact it is something we all like and need in our lives. Perhaps the government should give more support to our own popular culture, and then our goals of a better \u201ccreative economy\u201d can be achieved.\nIf Ada Apa Dengan Cinta (What\u2019s Up with Love) became so well-loved in our neighboring countries, could we export our films to non-Malay speaking countries too? Maybe yes, if we have a more sound strategy like Hallyu, using soft power to make Indonesia become known to the world.\n***\nDanny Yatim is a lecturer at Atma Jaya University and a creative writing instructor at The Jakarta Post Writing Center.
