A total of 12 boats participated in Class A, 15 in Class B, 35 in Class C and 12 in Class E. It turned out to be the most boats that ever participated in a regatta and commodore Danny Strachan said the organising committee couldn\u2019t be more happy with the support they received. \u201cThis was by far the largest amount of boats that ever participated in the regatta,\u201d Strachan said. \u201cWe had some inclement weather, but all of the boats came out and they performed extremely well. So we are quite pleased with the way things turned out. It was a tremendous regatta.\u201d Strachan, since the inception of the regatta, said they have seen a tremendous increase in the participation of the boats and it turned out to be a successful regatta. He said the spectators had a lot of action on the water, which enabled more of them to view the competition. Based on the performances of the boats, Strachan said they are already planning for the 63rd version of the regatta next year. Use the comment form below to begin a discussion about this content.
