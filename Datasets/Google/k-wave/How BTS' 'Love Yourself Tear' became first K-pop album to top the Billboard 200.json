    "title": "How BTS' 'Love Yourself: Tear' became first K-pop album to top the Billboard 200",
    "text": "Jeon Jungkook was 11 years old when the first K-pop album, BoA\u2019s self-titled English-language LP, broke into the Billboard 200 in April 2009. Just under a decade later, he\u2019s one of the seven men who made history this week when his group BTS became the first South Korean act to top the American charts. Love Yourself: Tear, the first predominantly non-English album to hit No. 1 since Il Divo\u2019s Ancora in 2006, is BTS\u2019 sixth project to debut on the Billboard 200. Their 2015 record, The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Pt. 2, was the first, peaking at No. 171, and each successive album has climbed further than the last. September\u2019s Love Yourself: Her \u2014 which featured The Chainsmoker-penned \u201cBest of Me\u201d and resulted in a Steve Aoki remix of \u201cMic Drop\u201d featuring Desiigner \u2014 landed at No. 7. The septet\u2019s achievement comes after years of K-pop acts gaining sizable Stateside audiences, but failing to enter the mainstream U.S. music scene in earnest. In South Korea, America has long been considered the most important frontier of the pop culture phenomena known as the Korean Wave, or Hallyu. But while Korean acts were able to gain strong footholds throughout Asia and build up fanbases in other countries, making a long-term impact in the U.S. has previously proved elusive. Between BoA\u2019s first album and BTS\u2019 historic one, 20 additional Korean records, including five others by BTS, have appeared on the Billboard 200 \u2014 all by boy bands or girl groups, or from soloists who grew out of them. Several artists, including BoA, CL, and the Wonder Girls, have attempted to crossover with English-language music, but failed to make a long-lasting impact. Though the three groups are major stars throughout Asia, only BTS\u2019 albums have stayed on the charts for longer than a week. So why has BTS been able to do so when other K-pop acts haven\u2019t? Credit the power of BTS\u2019 ARMY (Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth), one of the most dedicated followings in music. In 2017, BTS was the most tweeted-about celebrity on Twitter, and the most talked about Korean act on Tumblr, where they are bigger than Beyonc\u00e9, Harry Styles, and Taylor Swift. ARMY\u2019s passion has helped propelled the act to the top of the Billboard 200. BTS has also stood out with an eclectic style of music \u2014 on Tear, they seamlessly jump between emo rap (\u201cFake Love\u201d), Latin pop vibes (\u201cAirplane pt. 2\u201d), and bright EDM (\u201cSo What\u201d) \u2014 and their socially aware brand of K-pop. Early K-pop acts like Seo Taiji & Boys and H.O.T. regularly addressed societal issues, but BTS is unique among their Korean peers, having sung about the stresses of economic disparity and political crises throughout their discography. Thanks to the ease of online translation services, BTS\u2019 lyrics have helped attract fans from around the world \u2014 regardless of whether they understand Korean or not. Also powering the group\u2019s Stateside popularity is their social media presence. BTS was one of the first K-pop acts to truly dedicate themselves to digital spaces and form a bond with fans there. As an act from a smaller Korean label \u2014 Big Hit Entertainment had success with pop ballad acts in the late \u201800s and early \u201810s, but had previously teetered towards bankruptcy \u2014 BTS was able to approach fans in a more intimate manner than groups from more traditional K-pop companies. Throughout their rise, the group has regularly posted moments of their daily lives, and frequently thank ARMY for their support. As they move further into the Stateside music industry with their latest release and an upcoming, sold-out North American leg of their world tour, there are many expectations regarding what BTS\u2019 success means for K-pop and Hallyu (BTS was recently congratulated by South Korean President Moon Jae-in for helping Korean music top the Billboard 200.) Their rise will likely spur interest in other Korean artists and potentially lead to more regular appearances on charts (K-pop is already prominent on Billboard\u2019s Social 50 and World Albums charts). But, like Psy, the South Korean star behind hit 2012 single \u201cGangnam Style,\u201d the appeal of BTS and their music isn\u2019t based around the language it\u2019s performed in or the country that it\u2019s (mostly) created in. It\u2019s their ability to relate to fans their own age that\u2019s landed them in a league of their own, and will help them stand as the undeniable kings of K-pop in the U.S. for years to come. ",
