To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. By Elizabeth Peng As you might suspect, Asia\u2019s biggest megastar arrived with a bang in Brooklyn. The 28-year-old G-Dragon, formerly of K-pop boy band Big Bang, played Barclays Center amid his four-continent world tour, Act III, M.O.T.T.E., or Moment of Truth the End, a three-part performance chronicling the oeuvre of his solo career (which began in 2009) and the perpetual tension between his larger-than-life persona (G-Dragon) and his more introverted, actual self (Kwon Ji Yong). For the South Korean performer, who many have compared to Michael Jackson in terms of both talent and career arc, commanding the stage comes naturally. G-Dragon has been training for this moment for essentially his entire young life: working tirelessly among the lower rungs of the then-nascent Korean pop and entertainment industry in the 1990s and signing onto mainstream label YG Entertainment (LVMH is a current investor) in the early aughts. With Big Bang, G-Dragon and his bandmates\u2014T.O.P., Taeyang, Seungri, and Daesung\u2014went on to sell more than 140 million records, propelling themselves into superstar status both at home and throughout the rest of Asia and breaking records in Japan, Taiwan, and mainland China. The rest of the world soon took note. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to be famous when I started making music. I mean, that wasn\u2019t the first thing I wanted,\u201d G-Dragon told I-D in June. \u201cBut, of course, I see more and more people getting interested in Korean culture, and I\u2019m so proud about it. I\u2019m honored in a way. I love my country, so I\u2019m more than happy to see it shine. It\u2019s going really fast; there\u2019s a good and a bad side to it, but I try to take the best of it. I still want to try new things so I can learn about them and then teach those things to younger people.\u201d The rising tide of popularity of Korean pop music\u2014consider the current prominence of Billboard-award winning bands like BTS\u2014is also characteristic of a broader, cultural sweep known as hallyu, or the \u201cKorean Wave,\u201d a transnational flow of state-sponsored soft power in which music, television, fashion, beauty, aesthetics, and cuisine are all exported for ready consumption, giving birth to an enduring era of irrefutable Korean cultural currency. The effect of hallyu has not gone unnoticed: China\u2019s government recently imposed a ban on K-pop stars, television dramas, and beauty products from entering mainland China as a retaliatory effort against the bilateral, U.S.\u2013South Korean installation of the THAAD missile defense system. With the rise of the Korean Wave also came G-Dragon\u2019s own staggering celebrity. A consummate breakout artist, he is known for his outr\u00e9, gender-fluid fashions and slick, signature swag. His wide range of performance styles\u2014rapping a lyrical verse one minute, singing falsetto sotto voce the next\u2014perfectly captures the allure of K-pop\u2019s unique synthesis: It\u2019s part pop, hip-hop, and EDM, with the occasional interspersing of English words. Where K-pop really nails it, though, is with music videos, in which outsize outfits and non-narrative worlds of fantasy, fun, and intrigue converge\u2014these are the blueprints that viral successes (think: Psy\u2019s \u201cGangnam Style\u201d) are made of. As the undisputed K-pop king, G-Dragon has not only transcended this label, but also his genre, and he does so by pushing boundaries and retaining a tightly drawn veil of mystique. It\u2019s no wonder he has also captured the admiration of fashion\u2019s elite, like designers Karl Lagerfeld, Hedi Slimane, and Jeremy Scott (he even began his own fashion line, PeaceMinusOne), and collaborated with such artists as Missy Elliott, Justin Bieber, Diplo, Baauer, Skrillex, and M.I.A. \u201cI am going through an important phase in my life,\u201d the musician recently told Hello Asia!. \u201cInstead of focusing on showing a trendy new look and sound, I\u2019ve worked on this album as if it\u2019s my last.\u201d A by-product of the wildly inventive K-pop process is that the music and the performance are always an amalgam of sorts. Because the content of his work isn\u2019t rooted to a particular sense of place, culture, or time, G-Dragon is able to move around in new spaces and openings, sliding through the full-scale range of creative ingenuity and identity. Often deemed androgynous or gender-bending in a society that maintains traditional, patriarchal values and a noted adherence to manufactured beauty ideals (and plastic surgery), G-Dragon has no qualms sitting atop a white throne in an effete burgundy velvet smoking tuxedo with a matching choker and drop earrings, or crooning a ballad one minute and spitting rhymes among a scantily clad, all-female ensemble the next. \u201cWe are still hungry,\u201d G-Dragon told I-D. \u201cKorean people, including me, want to go faster and faster. In music, in fashion, in art, too. One shot, one kill: That\u2019s my mentality.\u201d His chameleon-like style and irrepressible persona continue to set hearts aflutter\u2014his is an aura and aesthetic where, for some, it\u2019s not merely enough to just aspire to date him, but to be him, as is the case of China\u2019s latest K-pop inspired \u201cboy band\u201d Acrush, comprised of five handsome girls borrowing from his legacy and tableau. But G-Dragon, soon approaching mandatory inscription into South Korea\u2019s military service, seems to have far evolved from the persona he helped to create, opting instead for the more introspective and grown-up man Kwon Ji Yong has become. This concert is \u201cmore like a present for myself,\u201d the star told Hello Asia!, citing a desire to achieve \u201csomething meaningful\u201d that he can recall fondly, a person who has made a real impact, and \u201cI don\u2019t want that person to be G-Dragon.\u201d By Hannah Jackson By Hannah Jackson By Alexis Bennett Parker \u201cWho am I?\u201d G-Dragon asks the audience in a pretaped monologue during his second act at Barclays, a shiny sequined red kimono glistening as the camera playfully conceals his face\u2014the audience, in suspense, hopes for the slightest reveal.
