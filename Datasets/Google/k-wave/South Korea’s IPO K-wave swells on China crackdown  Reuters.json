    "text": "HONG KONG, Jan 18 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Investors have watched the movies, bought the cosmetics and got hooked on its survival dramas. Now companies are becoming South Korea\u2019s latest K-wave export as the $10.8 billion float  read more  of battery maker LG Energy Solution (373220.KS) breaks records. With interest in China dimmed by geopolitics and regulatory uncertainties, other Asian markets are moving out of its shadow. Seoul can benefit if valuations don\u2019t overheat. LGES, a spin-off from LG Chem (051910.KS), is valued at $59 billion after pricing its IPO at the top of its range. The deal, the country\u2019s largest-ever and which set new highs for demand, followed a record year for listings. Including the $4.6 billion raised in March in New York by e-commerce group Coupang, Korean companies last year raked in nearly $23 billion from going public, according to Dealogic. That\u2019s more than funds raised in the preceding five years combined. A confluence of factors is at work. International interest in Asian markets outside China has grown since Beijing\u2019s regulatory crackdowns, beginning in July, dented confidence and weakened valuations. Hot startups in Southeast Asia are also profiting from that  read more . Korea\u2019s retail investors, who account for just over half of trading volumes per HSBC, have been also excited by buzzy new listings at home. In addition to technology startups cashing in, Korea\u2019s conglomerates have begun to get in on the action. SK group, for example, last year floated its battery-materials maker SK IE Technology (361610.KS) and vaccine developer SK Bioscience (302440.KS) in deals worth $3.3 billion. This month, its security devices unit filed for a $1 billion IPO. Hyundai Engineering (000720.KS), part of the autos-to-steel making group, on Jan. 17 opened books for a $1 billion offering. LGES\u2019s pricing gives it an enterprise value 22 times its forecast 2022 EBTIDA, per financial publication IFR, compared with a multiple of roughly 40 times for $223 billion Chinese rival Contemporary Amperex Technology (300750.SZ). Yet not all Korean deals have priced so reasonably. Video games producer Krafton (259960.KS), the country\u2019s largest float last year, cut the price and the number of shares on offer to raise $3.8 billion in August, from hopes of $5 billion, after regulators intervened  read more . That still implied a valuation of 33 times 2021 earnings; a one-third fall in its shares since their debut leaves the stock trading on 17 times this year\u2019s profit. Any more similarly-sized valuation declines from the country\u2019s latest IPO crop risks turning back this tide.
