ChinWook Lee quit a career working for an architecture company in South Korea to start his own business, aiming -- of all things -- to revolutionize the cosmetics industry. Lee teamed up with dermatologists to create a BB cream, a hybrid of skincare and makeup that moisturizes the skin while evening it out at the same time. He launched the Dr. Jart+ brand in 2005, a year after founding his company, Have & Be Co. It went on to become a major global success story in this new market segment. ",
