One Korean star is well-known for his role as a gentle, sensitive shy musician with anime-like looks in mega-hit drama \u201cBoys Over Flowers\u201d, but he was questioned by police in July for allegedly beating up his ex-girl friend and breaking her ribs.\u00a0Another dashing K idol described himself as \u201cblissfully\u201d in love with his young wife, but within half a year he had allegedly begun an affair with an even younger model who was arrested for blackmailing him for $5million.\u00a0Under the veneer of flawless skin, painfully stylish clothes and unwavering smiles, 2014 has been a year of non-stop scandals in the Korean entertainment industry \u2013 from drug and physical abuse arrests to shock relationships and artistes suing their management companies or getting thrown out of their bands.\u00a0We run through 2014\u2019s biggest K-wave shakeups and ask Singaporean fans how they feel when cracks start to appear on their idols\u2019 seemingly perfect public lives.\u00a0In Part 1, we break down the three biggest abuse scandals and find out if these Hallyu stars have shone less brightly since then. 1. Physical abuse scandal: Kim Hyun Joong \u2013 \u2018We were just playing around\u2019\u00a0Boys over Flowers star Kim Hyun Joong, called the next Bae Yong Jun for his sensitive new age guy looks, has commented about love and respect regarding the girl of his dreams.\u00a0That carefully cultivated image was destroyed when he was accused by an ex-girlfriend of physical abuse in August this year. She alleged that over the course of two months, he broke her ribs and repeatedly assaulted her, leaving her with bruises all over her body.\u00a0Kim\u2019s camp immediately denied the allegations but later sent out a statement claiming that he had \u201caccidentally\u201d broken her ribs during a fight. This was met by skepticism from netizens, who saw it as a move to limit damage to his reputation.\u00a0Finally, in September, he made a public apology, admitting that he had hurt her \u201cboth mentally and physically.\u201d\u00a0\u201cI have done what a man should never do and feel very ashamed. This matter is completely my fault,\u201d wrote Kim, 28.\u00a0His ex-girlfriend accepted his apology and decided to drop assault charges.\u00a0Singaporean fans were divided about the physical abuse allegations, but most admitted that they saw him in a new, less flattering light.\u00a0\u201cAfter watching Boys over Flowers, I thought of Hyun-Joong oppa (older brother) as a kind of angel, like a perfect man. I don\u2019t want to believe that this is true, that he hit a woman. If he really did, then of course he\u2019s wrong,\u201d said administrative officer Ginnie Teo, 27, who travelled around Asia to attend Kim\u2019s fan meetings for the past two years and is thinking of withdrawing her support.\u00a0\u201cI really hope he\u2019s sorry, but of course I feel very disappointed,\u201d she added.\u00a0\u201cI will support him no matter what, through thick and thin,\u201d said local fan Hazel Yeo, 34, who told Yahoo Singapore that she left messages of support on his fan pages and was slammed for it. \u201cI\u2019m sure that he will weather this storm and come back stronger than ever. I don\u2019t believe the allegations.\u201d 2. Drug abuse scandal: Park Bom \u2013 'I needed the pills for medical reasons'\u00a02NE1 member Park Bom, 30, has been plagued with scandals since the start of her career with the successful girl-band. First there were speculations about plastic surgery, then about her fabricating her age and lip-syncing on stage.\u00a0In July this year, Park was accused of \u201csmuggling\u201d amphetamines from the United States into South Korea by mail four years ago.\u00a0The case had supposedly been \u201ccovered up\u201d because she was a star but brought back to light again by Korean publication Segye Ilbo.\u00a0Park\u2019s entertainment company, YG Family, issued a statement \u201cclarifying\u201d the issue.\u00a0In an open letter, CEO Yang Hyun Suk explained that Park had witnessed the death of a soccer team-mate when she was a teenager in the United States and had suffered from depression after the incident.\u00a0The amphetamines, Yang claimed, were prescription medicine from a university hospital in the States to treat her trauma. Park had asked her mother and grandmother to mail the \u201cmedication\u201d to her in Seoul.\u00a0\u201cThankfully, the hospital provided medical records and prescriptions for the investigation, and the case was wrapped up with no further issues,\u201d wrote Yang.\u00a0While most 2NE1 fans Yahoo Singapore spoke to said they accepted her explanation and would continue being loyal supporters, some said that she had lost their respect.\u00a0\u201cWhy would she need to bring in the amphetamines from the US? If she was truly suffering from depression, she should just see a doctor in Seoul, where she is based. I think it\u2019s fishy,\u201d said undergraduate Nur Dianah, 22, who added that fans should be objective and less na\u00efve.\u00a0\u201cThe accident happened years ago. And if she is truly still suffering from depression, I think she needs to get some real treatment or take a break from singing to focus on her health,\u201d she added.\u00a0\u201cWhen Bom was asked why her face is so round and bloated like she did plastic surgery, she claimed that it was due to a medical condition. And now, she says she takes these drugs also for medical reasons,\u201d said bank executive Rina Tan, 29.\u00a0\u201cI like her music, but I don\u2019t think she has much integrity as a person,\u201d she said.\u00a03. Blackmail and adultery scandal: Lee Byung Hun \u2013 'No comment' Lauded for his acting chops and successful crossover to Hollywood, Lee Byung Hun was held up as a shining example of the \u201cKorean wave\u201d. His popularity increased even more when he married up and coming actress Lee Min Jung, 32, in a fairytale ceremony in 2013.\u00a0Now, he is embroiled in a blackmail and adultery scandal, which could cost him his career and marriage.\u00a0In September 2014, Lee, 44, made a police report claiming two women were blackmailing him using a \u201ccompromising\" video. One was K-pop girl group member Da Hee and another was model Lee Ji Yeon.\u00a0The two girls were arrested, charged and face jail \u2013 but the tide has turned against Lee as investigations into the blackmailing continue.\u00a0First, there was shock that he was apparently cheating on his wife of just a year.\u00a0Police documents showed that the two girls made frequent trips to Lee\u2019s home, where they would sit and drink alcohol together in the absence of his wife.\u00a0It was allegedly during one of these drinking sessions that the two girls took a video of Lee using lewd and sexual language on them and tried to blackmail him for a whopping $5 million.\u00a0 Model Lee Ji Yeon has claimed through her lawyer that she and Lee were having an affair and that she had decided to film the video when he broke up with her after 3 months.\u00a0\u201cIn her emotionally hurt state, she blackmailed him with the video,\u201d said her lawyer.\u00a0Photos, allegedly from model Lee\u2019s Instagram account showing lavish Hermes gifts and personalized bottles of wine from the actor, were also dug up by netizens.\u00a0One photo of an extremely rare bottle of Dragonback wine from an Argentinian wine estate coincided with a trip Lee made to the same vineyard around the same time.\u00a0While Lee\u2019s camp has staunchly denied allegations of an affair, he has faced significant backlash online from angry fans, especially after his wife posted a photo of clouds captioned \u201cOnly God Knows.\u201d\u00a0Fans here said they were \u201cshocked\u201d by the news.\u00a0\u201cI am a fan of his acting, but it looks like he has some really big personal issues,\u201d said housewife Goh TY, 45, who has been supporting Lee since his \u201cAll In\u201d drama days.\u201cI will still watch his shows as his personal life is his own affair, but I feel really sorry for his wife. They looked so happy together.\u201d\u00a0\u201cLooks like his move to report the girls to the police has backfired on him,\u201d said teacher Darren Lim, 31, who enjoys Lee\u2019s fighting and action movies.\u00a0\u201cUnfortunately they are the ones who are going to have to serve out jail sentences and he\u2019ll get off scot free. I\u2019m not surprised, though \u2013 stars are human too, and they can be ugly too. We just don\u2019t see it on the outside.\u201d\u00a0In Part 2 of K-wave idols acting out, we bring you up to speed on K-celebrities coming out about their relationships and their fan reactions \u2013 everything from murder and suicide threats to overwhelming positive support.
