    "text": "LOUISVILLE, KY (WAVE) \u2013 A mother with two young children was arrested after allegedly falling asleep inside a store in a drug-induced haze. On August 24\u00a0just after\u00a08:30 p.m., witnesses called police after observing Melissa Bahmandeji, 33,\u00a0drifting off\u00a0at the Circle K on the corner of Johnsontown Road and Dixie Highway in Valley Station. When police arrived, they found her standing in front of the soda machine, asleep, while her two children wandered the store alone. After waking her up, the officer said she claimed her medication made her sleepy. According to an arrest report, Bahmandeji later admitted she had a narcotic pain pill in her purse without a proper container for it. Police looked around the store and found a spoon with heroin residue in the store's bathroom. Witnesses said she was in the bathroom before they called police. Officers arrested her and put her in a police car, at which point they said she pulled two hypodermic needles, one loaded with a heroin-like substance, from her pants saying she was \"very thirsty because of that stuff.\" Bahmandeji was charged with public intoxication, possession of heroin and drug paraphernalia, and endangering the welfare of a minor.
