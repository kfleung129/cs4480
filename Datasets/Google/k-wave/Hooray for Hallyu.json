Isabela Agra \u201820 never dreamed that her love of K-pop \u2014 the energetic and infectious music synonymous with South Korea \u2014 could harmonize with a business degree. The Liberal Studies major at Bentley taught her otherwise. Growing up in Sao Paulo, Brazil, Agra was always fascinated by cultures beyond her own. \u201cI knew I wanted to go to college in another country,\u201d she says. \u201cA friend moved to the U.S. just as I was starting high school, and her older brother went to Bentley. He had great things to say, so it was tops on my list.\u201d In her first year on campus, Agra chose to live in a defined community, an option for students with similar interests. Hers had a global theme: \u201cAll of us came from different places and wanted to learn about other countries and cultures.\u201d She and two other students \u2014 one from Hong Kong, the other of Chinese American heritage \u2014 bonded over their shared love of K-pop artists like GOT7 and iKON. As the friendship grew, so did Agra\u2019s interest in South Korea. She took Korean language lessons and, later, put the skills to use visiting one of those friends, who was studying in Seoul. Soon after arriving at Bentley, Agra chose a business major: Economics-Finance. But a first-year Global Studies course awakened her to further possibilities. \u201cEvery day, we\u2019d talk about what was happening in the world, not only as it related to business, but also\u00a0how it\u00a0affected us\u00a0personally,\u201d she explains. \u201cI realized I could harness my passion and curiosity for foreign cultures in a way that would complement my business degree.\u201d That led Agra to Liberal Studies, an integrated double major where business students enhance their studies through concentrated liberal arts courses. The major gives students maximum flexibility to customize their education. It offers nine distinct concentrations \u2014 including Global Perspectives, Agra\u2019s choice \u2014 and ends with an intensive research project that students design with support from a faculty adviser. Agra\u2019s culminating project was a deep dive into South Korean culture, specifically Hallyu, which translates as \u201cKorean wave.\u201d Coined by Chinese journalists, the term refers to the global popularity of the nation\u2019s music, films and consumer goods such as cosmetics and fashion. \u201cIt was the perfect topic, allowing me to touch on things such as globalization, media, and expressions and interpretations of cultures,\u201d Agra notes. \u201cI connected it to my Eco-Fi major by focusing on Hallyu\u2019s economic impact.\u201d Her research found that Hallyu isn\u2019t a spontaneous cultural phenomenon, but rather the calculated result of targeted economic policies. That was a surprise, she says. \u201cWe mostly think of a nation\u2019s culture as separate from its economic development.\u201d In the mid-1990s, the South Korean government began leveraging its culture as way to revive a sluggish economy. From lifting its ban on foreign travel to investing in high-tech infrastructure and startup companies, the nation ultimately \u2014 and effectively \u2014 monetized cultural diplomacy: In 2019, Hallyu-related exports totaled $12.3 billion. Initially, Hallyu\u2019s\u202f\u00a0popularity was confined to\u00a0other Asian nations.\u202f\u00a0But social media extended its reach \u2014\u202fas evidenced by recording artist Psy\u2019s\u202f\u00a0\u201cGangnam Style,\u201d\u202f\u00a0which became the first YouTube video to\u202freach a billion views. Western audiences have\u202fsince embraced\u202fother Hallyu musicians, most notably\u202fboy band\u202fBTS,\u202fthe first\u00a0\u202fK-pop group to win a Billboard Music Award, and Blackpink, a girl group\u202fthat recently\u202fcollaborated with platinum-selling\u202f\u00a0Mexican American\u00a0singer and actress Selena Gomez. But music is only one area where Hallyu is making its mark. Korean dramas are popular options on global streaming giant Netflix, while the black comedy Parasite took home four Oscars at the 2020 Academy Awards, including Best Film \u2014 the first non-English language movie to do so. Korean cosmetics, or K-beauty, also dominate global markets. All of these avenues, Agra says, are\u202fways the\u202fSouth Korean government cultivates\u202f\u201csoft power,\u201d or the ability to influence other nations\u202fthrough collaboration instead of coercion.\u202fAnd,\u202fas her research made clear,\u202fsoft power translates into hard\u202fcurrency. \u201cAfter the Korean War,\u202fand throughout the\u202f1980s\u202fand early \u201890s, South Korea\u2019s economy was\u202ffairly\u202fstagnant,\u201d she reports. \u201cToday,\u202fthanks largely to Hallyu, it has the world\u2019s 12th-largest economy.\u201d Now back in Brazil and working for Johnson & Johnson, Agra plans to attend graduate school in \u2014 no surprise \u2014 South Korea. She\u2019s confident that her Bentley degree will distinguish her from other candidates. \u201cThe Liberal Studies major lets you delve into subjects that may seem unrelated, but at the end of the day, they make your understanding of business more holistic and well-rounded,\u201d she says. \u201cMy research was such an enriching experience, and it\u2019s made me a better economist.\u201d ",
