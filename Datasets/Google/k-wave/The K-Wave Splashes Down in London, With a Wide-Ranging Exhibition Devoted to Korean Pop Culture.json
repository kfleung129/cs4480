Christine Ajudua, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSeptember 28, 2022 Ten years ago, a little-known South Korean singer and rapper named Park Jae-Sang (a.k.a. PSY) put out a pop song and corresponding music video that catapulted both him and his country onto the global stage. With its quirky, catchy hook and all-too-imitable dance moves, Gangnam Style\u2014referring to the affluent district south of the Han River in Seoul\u2014became the first music video to reach 1 billion views on YouTube, a viral hit in the relatively early days of digital virality, while ushering in a still-growing wave of K-pop, K-drama, K-beauty, pretty much K-everything around the world. Now, just weeks after Frieze launched its first fair in Seoul, the phenomenon has been documented in \u201cHallyu! The Korean Wave\u201d (through June 25, 2023), a first-of-its-kind exhibition on the country\u2019s pop culture that opened last weekend at London\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum. Installation view of \u201cHallyu! The Korean Wave\u201d at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Supported by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism\u2014Republic of Korea and Genesis. \u201cSouth Korea has captivated the world over with hallyu,\u201d said lead curator Rosalie Kim, using the Korean word for \u201cK-Wave,\u201d in a statement. It has, she continued, \u201ctransformed the country\u2019s image from one devastated by the Korean War to that of a leading cultural powerhouse in the era of social media and digital culture.\u201d With more than 200 objects on display\u20141988 Seoul Summer Olympics posters; the world\u2019s first commercial MP3 player; the green tracksuit and guard costumes from the Netflix series Squid Game; beauty products from the 13th century and today\u2014the show aptly opens with Gangnam Style, featuring the pink suit jacket that PSY wore in the original video, beside video homages filmed on several continents. There\u2019s an entire gallery devoted to K-pop\u2014you enter it through a corridor lined with K-fan light sticks\u2014with Seo Taiji and Boys as well as BoA album covers, Aespa and Ateez costumes, and other ephemera. Excerpts of music videos by Big Bang, NCT, and Blackpink play on a loop, and you can dance along to PSY\u2019s That That, thanks to an interactive choreographic challenge created in collaboration with Google Arts & Culture Lab.

Meanwhile, the V&A worked with Parasite\u2019s production designer, Lee Ha Jun, to recreate the bathroom from the Kim family\u2019s banjiha (semi-basement apartment) in Bong Joon-ho\u2019s Oscar-winning film as an immersive installation. And there are monumental works by artists such as Ham Kyungah and Gwon Osang, including a 1986 Nam June Paik video sculpture with 33 TV monitors. You\u2019ll also find contemporary hanbok (\u201cKorean clothing\u201d) worn by the likes of BTS alongside ensembles by fashion designers Minju Kim, Mu\u0308nn, and Miss Sohee, as well as special commissions inspired by traditional garments, with a cheollik dress by Tchai Kim among them.
