A lot of conversations about K-pop mischaracterise or leave fans out of the equation altogether, so I'm really thrilled to be centring them in this conversation and letting them be the ones to tell their stories! \u201cHaving been a huge K-pop stan for so long, it's amazing to be a part of sharing with the world why it's so meaningful and fun for fans, and maybe (just maybe!) convert a few more newbies in the process.\u201d Adele Roberts says: \u201cIn 2017, I gave BTS its first play on Radio 1, marking the beginning of my journey of discovering K-Pop, meeting stans and icons and even travelling to South Korea. Of all aspects of K-Pop, for me it\u2019s the fans that make this movement so special; the feeling of togetherness, kindness and inclusion that they embody is just incredible. \u201cIt\u2019s like a close family that just happens to be spread across the planet!
