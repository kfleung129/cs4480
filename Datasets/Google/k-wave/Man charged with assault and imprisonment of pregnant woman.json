    "text": "LOUISVILLE, KY (WAVE) \u2013 A Shively man has been charged with assaulting a woman and holding her against he will. Shively police were originally called to an apartment in the 3800 block of Dixie Highway by someone who said it sounded like an assault was taking place. After officers knocked on the door and got no answer, they left. Police were called back about four hours later on a report that a woman had been assaulted by the father of her child and was being held in the apartment. Once again, officers got no answer at the door, but remained in the area. About 30 minutes later they saw Ronnie K. Blair, 24, trying to leave the apartment with the woman. The woman told police Blair had punched her in the head, causing her to fall and injure her ankle. She also said Blair took her cell phone to prevent her from calling police and held her against her will for more than four hours. Blair was arrested on charges of unlawful imprisonment, assault and intimidating a participant in the legal process. The woman, who is pregnant, was taken to University of Louisville Hospital for a possible serious ankle injury and to check for injuries to the unborn child. Copyright 2014 WAVE 3 News.
