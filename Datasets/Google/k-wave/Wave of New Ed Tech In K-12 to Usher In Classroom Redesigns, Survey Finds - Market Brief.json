    "title": "Wave of New Ed Tech In K-12 to Usher In Classroom Redesigns, Survey Finds - Market Brief",
    "text": "As ed tech proliferates in schools, more classrooms are likely to get makeovers to accommodate new ways of teaching and learning\u00a0with digital tools and platforms. That\u2019s the conclusion of a new survey, which found that\u00a078 percent of K-12 facilities officials and administrators\u00a0said they expect classroom redesign to be a priority in the next three to five years. In higher education, about 91 percent of leaders expect to make\u00a0adjustments to classrooms due to technology, according to the facilities\u00a0survey conducted by SchoolDude, a company that provides software-as-a-service for operations management data\u00a0and decisionmaking in education.   \u201cWe are definitely seeing more districts, colleges and universities doing facility assessments,\u201d said Nicholas Mirisis, the marketing leader at Dude Solutions, the parent company of SchoolDude. These evaluations of facilities look at the age of an educational space, whether it has reached obsolescence, and attempt to estimate the cost of replacing the system or sub-system. They\u00a0are often the precursor to making the case for providing funding to renovate or build a new facility, he said. The arrival of technology is \u201cforcing a faster rate of renovation than we would have seen in the past,\u201d said Mirisis, noting that the average age of a K-12 space is 46 to 48 years. \u201cOur students are in a facility that was designed, scoped, and built in the \u201960s and \u201970s,\u201d he said. \u201cThe technology demands and power demands are vastly different today.\u201d College and university respondents reported being\u00a0more likely to pursue classroom redesign\u00a0to adapt to the changes of technology\u2014a fact that Mirisis attributed to greater competitive pressures in higher education, as students want to be in more attractive and up-to-date facilities. \u201cThat segment has always been at the forefront of attracting the next generation of students,\u201d and keeping the students they have, he said.\u00a0It also has more sources of revenue to cover the costs of making changes, he said. The survey had 514 total respondents, 81 percent of whom were from K-12 schools, mostly of them public. Nineteen percent were from higher education. The respondents come from eight countries and 46 states, with the largest number coming from California, Texas, Washington, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Respondents\u2019 titles\u00a0ranged\u00a0from\u00a0\u201cmaintenance and facility supervisors\u201d to\u00a0superintendents,\u00a0representing districts with enrollments from under 1,000 students to nine districts that have more than 60,000 students.
