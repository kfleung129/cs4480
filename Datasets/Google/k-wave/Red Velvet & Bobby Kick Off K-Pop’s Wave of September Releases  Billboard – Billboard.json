    "text": "After a few weeks of quiet, K-pop woke up this week in a big way through some sweet synthpop and swaggering rap. By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tTamar Herman Like the lazy final days of summer, the Korean music scene slowed down a bit last month as artists prepped for the onslaught of September. While acts like CL, EXO, I.O.I, VIXX, NCT Dream,\u00a0BlackPink, and Girls\u2019 Generation\u00a0all released new music last month, August was relatively quiet ahead of September, which is traditionally one of the K-pop scene\u2019s busiest seasons.

While a bit more saccharine than their typical sound, \u201cRussian Roulette\u201d was accompanied by a bubbly, athletic-themed music video that offered fun times for all as a murderous ode to The Simpsons\u2019 impish duo Itchy and Scratchy and killing your friends for the sake of love. Or just for fun, it\u2019s not quite clear. Red Velvet Explores Their Velvety Side With \u2018One of These Nights\u2019 The single is the title track off of their latest EP, an upbeat \u201cred\u201d-oriented album that followed March\u2019s smoother The Velvet.\u00a0The paired album concepts play up the dichotomy of the group\u2019s name; \u201cRed\u201d usually characterizes their more upbeat pop releases while \u201cVelvet\u201d embodies their smoother R&B sound, both of which are characteristic of Red Velvet\u2019s increasingly diverse musicality and style.   The same day as Russian Roulette came out, rapper Bobby released the first single from his collaborative MOBB project with WINNER\u2019s Song Mino. After gaining fame through television appearances and a variety of collaborations, \u201cHolup!\u201d is Bobby\u2019s first solo track since he debuted as a member of iKON last year. The song is a hip-hop banger that livens things up through Bobby\u2019s gruff rap style and his bombastic lyrics. Built to liven up a party, \u201cHolup!\u201d features wailing horns and a pounding, building beat that will have everyone dancing. It\u2019s the first song from the MOBB collaboration and will be followed by Song Mino\u2019s solo \u201cBody\u201d on Sept. 8, the pair\u2019s \u201cHit Me\u201d and \u201cFull House\u201d the next day. While the pair are from different groups, they\u2019re both housed under YG Entertainment. It is the first intergroup project since WINNER debuted in 2014 and iKON joined the scene in 2015.  \u201cHolup!\u201d and \u201cRussian Roulette\u201d went to the top of the U.S. iTunes K-pop chart, battling it out for the top spot upon their releases, but it\u2019s unclear whether either song will be able to dominate for long with the overflow of K-pop this September. Along with Red Velvet and MOBB, this week will also see a return from Brown Eyed Girls\u2019 Gain with her End Again EP on Sept. 9. After making waves last year with her religiously colored Hawwah,\u00a0all eyes are on the controversial soloist to see what she does next. SHINee Talk Upcoming Projects & How EDM Is Influencing K-Pop Artists at KCON LA 2016  The following week will see new music from the charismatic boy band 2PM as they drop their sixth album, Gentlemen\u2019s Game, on Sept. 13 following last year\u2019s No. 5. And retro-pop with an orchestral twist will likely come into play on Sept. 19 when INFINITE releases their first Korean album of 2016, their sixth EP INFINITE Only.  The rest of the month will be filled with comebacks from high profile K-pop boy bands like SHINee, GOT7, BTOB, B1A4, must-watch rookies KNK, and \u201890s icons Sechs Kies. And, although they haven\u2019t announced any dates, BTS has been teasing fans with cinematic videos for their Wings project. Korean Boy Band GOT7 Discusses Breaking Records, Selling Out Shows & Dabbing  And while the month is pretty testosterone-dominated, girl groups like T-ara, who was declared the winners of Billboard\u2019s Fan Army Face-Off earlier this month, sweet APink, DIA (who are teasing fans with a Harry Potter-inspired concept), and quirky Crayon Pop all announced upcoming returns. Soloists Ailee and Secret member Song Jieun also reportedly have plans for new music over the next few weeks, but with K-pop\u2019s fast-paced release calendar it\u2019s likely that September will hold a few surprises.
