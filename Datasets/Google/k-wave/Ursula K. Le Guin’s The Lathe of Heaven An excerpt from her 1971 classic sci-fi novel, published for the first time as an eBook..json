Le Guin\u2019s classic 1971 science fiction novel\u00a0The Lathe of Heaven,\u00a0George Orr discovers that his dreams have the power to alter reality. Upon waking, the world he knew has become a strange, barely recognizable place, where only George has the clear memory of how it was before. He seeks counseling from Dr. William Haber, a psychiatrist who immediately understands how powerful a weapon George wields.\u00a0Soon, George is Haber\u2019s pawn, and the fate of humanity grows more imperiled with every waking hour. The Lathe of Heaven is at once eerie and prescient, wildly entertaining and ferociously intelligent. This marks the first publication of The Lathe of Heaven as an eBook, and Slate and Diversion Books are offering Le Guin\u2019s novel at a special price, $3.99, for one week only.

Tomorrow a wise man may explain it; that tomorrow will not be for ten thousand generations.\u201d \u2014 CHUANG TSE: II Current-borne, wave-flung, tugged hugely by the whole might of ocean, the jellyfish drifts in the tidal abyss. The light shines through it, and the dark enters it. Borne, flung, tugged from anywhere to anywhere, for in the deep sea there is no compass but nearer and farther, higher and lower, the jellyfish hangs and sways; pulses move slight and quick within it, as the vast diurnal pulses beat in the moon-driven sea. Hanging, swaying, pulsing, the most vulnerable and insubstantial creature, it has for its defense the violence and power of the whole ocean, to which it has entrusted its being, its going, and its will. But here rise the stubborn continents. The shelves of gravel and the cliffs of rock break from water baldly into air, that dry, terrible outerspace of radiance and instability, where there is no support for life. And now, now the currents mislead and the waves betray, breaking their endless circle, to leap up in loud foam against rock and air, breaking \u2026 What will the creature made all of seadrift do on the dry sand of daylight; what will the mind do, each morning, waking? His eyelids had been burned away, so that he could not close his eyes, and the light entered into his brain, searing. He could not turn his head, for blocks of fallen concrete pinned him down and the steel rods projecting from their cores held his head in a vise. When these were gone he could move again; he sat up. He was on the cement steps; a dandelion flowered by his hand, growing from a little cracked place in the steps. After a while he stood up, but as soon as he was on his feet he felt deathly sick, and knew it was the radiation sickness. The door was only two feet from him, for the balloonbed when inflated half filled his room. He got to the door and opened it and went through it. There stretched the endless linoleum corridor, heaving slightly up and down for miles, and far down it, very far, the men\u2019s room. He started out toward it, trying to hold on to the wall, but there was nothing to hold on to, and the wall turned into the floor. \u201cEasy now. Easy there.\u201d The elevator guard\u2019s face was hanging above him like a paper lantern, pallid, fringed with graying hair. \u201cIt\u2019s the radiation,\u201d he said, but Mannie didn\u2019t seem to understand, saying only, \u201cTake it easy.\u201d He was back on his bed in his room. \u201cYou drunk?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cHigh on something?\u201d \u201cSick.\u201d \u201cWhat you been taking?\u201d \u201cCouldn\u2019t find the fit,\u201d he said, meaning that he had been trying to lock the door through which the dreams came, but none of the keys had fit the lock. \u201cMedic\u2019s coming up from the fifteenth floor,\u201d Mannie said faintly through the roar of breaking seas. He was floundering and trying to breathe. A stranger was sitting on his bed holding a hypodermic and looking at him. \u201cThat did it,\u201d the stranger said. \u201cHe\u2019s coming round. Feel like hell? Take it easy. You ought to feel like hell. Take all this at once?\u201d He displayed seven of the little plastifoil envelopes from the autodrug dispensary. \u201cLousy, mixture, barbiturates and Dexedrine. What were you trying to do to yourself?\u201d It was hard to breathe, but the sickness was gone, leaving only an awful weakness. \u201cThey\u2019re all dated this week,\u201d the medic went on, a young man with a brown ponytail and bad teeth. \u201cWhich means they\u2019re not all off your own Pharmacy Card, so I\u2019ve got to report you for borrowing. I don\u2019t like to, but I got called in and I haven\u2019t any choice, see. But don\u2019t worry, with these drugs it\u2019s not a felony, you\u2019ll just get a notice to report to the police station and they\u2019ll send you up to the Med School or the Area Clinic for examination, and you\u2019ll be referred to an M.D. or a shrink for VTT\u2014Voluntary Therapeutic Treatment. I filled out the form on you already, used your ID; all I need to know is how long you been using these drugs in more than your personal allotment?\u201d \u201cCouple months.\u201d The medic scribbled on a paper on his knee. \u201cAnd who\u2019d you borrow Pharm Cards from?\u201d \u201cFriends.\u201d \u201cGot to have the names.\u201d After a while the medic said, \u201cOne name, anyhow. Just a formality. It won\u2019t get \u2019em in trouble. See, they\u2019ll just get a reprimand from the police, and HEW Control will keep a check on their Pharm Cards for a year. Just a formality. One name.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t. They were trying to help me.\u201d \u201cLook, if you won\u2019t give the names, you\u2019re resisting, and you\u2019ll either go to jail or get stuck into Obligatory Therapy, in an institution. Anyway they can trace the cards through the autodrug records if they want to, this just saves \u2019em time. Come on, just give me one of the names.\u201d He covered his face with his arms to keep out the unendurable light and said, \u201cI can\u2019t. I can\u2019t do it. I need help.\u201d \u201cHe borrowed my card,\u201d the elevator guard said. \u201cYeah. Mannie Ahrens, 247-602-6023.\u201d The medic\u2019s pen went scribble scribble. \u201cI never used your card.\u201d \u201cSo confuse \u2019em a little. They won\u2019t check. People use people\u2019s Pharm Cards all the time, they can\u2019t check. I loan mine, use another cat\u2019s, all the time. Got a whole collection of those reprimand things. They don\u2019t know. I taken things HEW never even\u00a0heard\u00a0of. You ain\u2019t been on the hook before. Take it easy, George.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said, meaning that he could not let Mannie lie for him, could not stop him from lying for him, could not take it easy, could not go on. \u201cYou\u2019ll feel better in two, three hours,\u201d the medic said. \u201cBut stay in today. Anyhow downtown\u2019s all tied up, the GPRT drivers are trying another strike and the National Guard\u2019s trying to run the subway trains and the news says it\u2019s one hell of a mess. Stay put. I got to go, I walk to work, damn it, ten minutes from here, that State Housing Complex down on Macadam.\u201d The bed jounced as he stood up. \u201cYou know there\u2019s two hundred sixty kids in that one complex suffering from kwashiorkor? All low-income or Basic Support families, and they aren\u2019t getting protein. And what the hell am I supposed to do about it? I\u2019ve put in five different reqs for Minimal Protein Ration for those kids and they don\u2019t come, it\u2019s all red tape and excuses. People on Basic Support can afford to buy sufficient food, they keep telling me. Sure, but what if the food isn\u2019t there to buy? Ah, the hell with it. I go give \u2019em Vitamin C shots and try to pretend that starvation is just scurvy\u2026\u201d The door shut. The bed jounced when Mannie sat down on it where the medic had been sitting. There was a faint smell, sweetish, like newly cut grass. Out of the darkness of closed eyes, the mist rising all round, Mannie\u2019s voice said remotely, \u201cAin\u2019t it great to be alive?\u201d Slate and Diversion Books are offering the first-ever eBook of The Lathe of Heaven at a special price, $3.99, for one week only.
