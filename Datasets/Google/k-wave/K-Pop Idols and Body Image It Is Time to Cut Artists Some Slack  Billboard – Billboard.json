    "text": "Oh My Girl member JinE ended her K-pop career, which included more than five years of training, to deal with an eating disorder. The news brings up some important questions about K-pop idols and\u2026 By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJeff Benjamin At the end of October, news came out of the K-pop world that JinE, from the eight-member\u00a0girl group Oh My Girl, was leaving\u00a0the industry after spending more than a year focusing on treatment for an eating disorder. The reveal arrived\u00a0at a time when body image, along with physical and mental health, are becoming increasingly discussed topics among artists and fans in the K-pop scene.

While promoting\u00a0\u201cCloser,\u201d JinE\u00a0shared an initial diagnosis of anorexia.  The petite, 5\u20193\u2033 star shared she lost between 17 to 20 pounds as the group dieted together for promotions \u2014 a\u00a0common\u00a0practice among K-pop groups who want to look their best as they appear on\u00a0cameras and social media at all hours of the day, but also as a response to Korean society\u2019s expectations for\u00a0idols to be thin and attractive. JinE shared that she developed vomiting symptoms and esophagitis, and\u00a0despite needing hospital care, the singer assured fans she was healthy. 2016 brought three more EP releases and increased\u00a0visibility for Oh My Girl, but the 22-year-old\u00a0was indefinitely pulled\u00a0from promoting with the group after her symptoms returned. Then last month, WM and JinE announced she would leave the group and company, with\u00a0the star expressing gratitude for the support she received but the desire for a different lifestyle.  The conversation about K-pop stars\u2019 body images and weights are being scrutinized more than ever, with strong opinions on both sides. While some argue that K-pop is a visually focused industry and those ideal body standards come with the territory of success, others say that it\u2019s time to end the stigma that performers must have \u201cideal\u201d bodies and rethink topics like dieting.  A tiny bit of research on the subject shows just how extreme\u00a0K-pop stars take their bodies. From Nine Muses\u2019 method to only eat what they fit in a small cup\u00a0to IU\u2019s week-long, 300-calorie daily diet of an apple, sweet potato and protein shake, idols speak about their intense (and dangerously unhealthy)\u00a0dieting seemingly as a point of additional buzz. Even when the results are concerning, the focus tends to lean toward the visual outcome rather than the star\u2019s health.\u00a0BTS\u2018 Jimin\u00a0became malnourished in an effort to be \u201cone of the better-looking guys.\u201d\u00a0B.A.P\u2018s Himchan fractured a rib due to a sudden weight loss. Super Junior\u2019s Shindong\u00a0spoke about how fitting into skinny jeans was \u201cthe epitome of success\u201d for him.\u00a0The fewer calories one eats, the more applause they get and the more attractive they are to fans, but at what cost?  Even putting aside the obvious and significant health and psychological risks that come with an eating disorder \u2014 more significant\u00a0than any successful album or viral hit \u2014 an important conversation comes as to why it\u2019s now an ideal time to finally cut these stars a break. It\u2019s no secret that the K-pop industry yearns to grow past not only South\u00a0Korea\u00a0but Asia at large, as the \u201cKorean wave\u201d continues to make inroads in important markets like America, South and Latin America, Australia and Europe. The fans in other parts of the world most likely have completely different\u00a0standards of beauty, and the \u201cnormalized\u201d version of what is beautiful to a K-pop star in Korea may not be an actual reality elsewhere.  Furthermore, the Korean companies that are giving the chances to those artists who do not fit the stereotypical beauty standards, and are\u00a0prioritizing health, should be applauded for focusing on talent and well-being rather than appearances. These companies see something past looks and give a much-needed chance to help talent\u00a0shine in a critical\u00a0music industry. If a hundred domestic\u00a0fans are supposedly not happy with what they see, an artist can find thousands of others elsewhere\u00a0who see them as perfect. As BTS prepares for its biggest international awards show performance to date at the American Music Awards this weekend, keep in mind that the group\u00a0found much of its success and fervent fandom outside of Korea before finally making it big at home, too. Many would argue that some members of BTS do not fit Korea\u2019s typical beauty standard and yet here they are, creating\u00a0Beatles-esque mania at LAX. Being a K-pop idol means being someone fans look up to, and that can, and certainly should, include individuals who don\u2019t fit the same mold as other singers. As K-pop continues to be for everyone\u00a0regardless of language and culture, shouldn\u2019t its singers also be for everyone regardless of weight, looks, height\u00a0and other surface-level attributes? Who\u2019s to say that an idol who doesn\u2019t have the perfect \u201cS- or X-line\u201d body\u00a0doesn\u2019t have the requirements to be a top star? Technology makes comments and critiques \u2014 both good and bad \u2014 more accessible, but we\u2019ll undoubtedly\u00a0continue to lose more of our favorite stars if we don\u2019t start highlighting the importance of diversity in body and beauty standards. We might not be able to change said beauty standards \u2014 that would require unpacking centuries of cultural and societal history\u00a0\u2014 but we can cut our idols some slack and stop putting their weights under a microscope.
