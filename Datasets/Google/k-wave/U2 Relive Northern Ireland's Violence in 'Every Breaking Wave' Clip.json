    "text": "By \n\n\tKory Grow The video for U2\u2018s new Songs of Innocence single, \u201cEvery Breaking Wave,\u201d dramatizes the wave of violence that swept Northern Ireland in the Eighties. Belfast-born filmmaker Aoife McArdle made the clip using footage from her 13-minute short film, Every Breaking Wave (streaming below), which came out earlier this month and made use of the U2 song of the same name and Songs of Innocence\u2018s final cut \u201cThe Troubles.\u201d The video opens with images of moshing and crowdsurfing at a punk show \u2014\u00a0made surreal with U2\u2019s\u00a0serene soundtrack \u2014 as a skinhead teen and young woman lock eyes. It chronicles their fast romance, running through the woods and diving into swimming pools, and also depicts the religious divide between them (one is Catholic; the other Protestant). From the Sixties through the late Nineties, Northern Ireland was the scene of violence as Protestant Unionists clashed with Catholic republicans, who wanted to secede from the U.K. and join the rest of Ireland. The lovers\u2019 story accordingly ends in tragedy in the clip.

The band have reminded me that neither they, nor Western civilization, are depending on this\u2026but then does the Edge, or Jimmy Page, or any guitarist you know have a titanium elbow, as I do now?\u201d Despite the vocalist\u2019s injuries, U2 have set a string of tour dates for the summer and fall. Each location of the tour will feature multiple concerts by the band. \u201cWe are going to try to have a completely different feeling from night one to night two and have some fun playing with the idea of innocence and experience,\u201d Bono said in a statement when\u00a0the tour was announced. \u201cMore to be revealed!\u201d We want to hear it.
