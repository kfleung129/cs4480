Or continue login with The Korean Wave, known widely as Hallyu, keeps making headlines with the presence of boy band BTS and girl bands Blackpink and Twice. It dominates the Youtube charts, with BTS reaching total views of 5.45 billion followed by Blackpink with 2.98 billion. According to the 2018 Korea Foundation\u2019s Global Hallyu Status Report, the number of Korean Wave fans reached 89.2 million in 113 countries. Some 70 million of them were in Asian countries. Jang Won-ho, dean of the University of Seoul\u2019s College of Urban Sciences and director of the Center for Global Culture and Social Empathy, explained that the amount of Korean content exports to ASEAN countries had increased from US$800 million in 2015 to $1.3 billion in 2017. East Asian countries China and Japan still dominate the market with Korean content exports of $2.9 billion in 2015 and $3.3 billion in 2017. \u201cASEAN is the second-largest market after East Asia, five times bigger than the North American market and 10 times that of Europe,\u201d Jang said. \u201cWe can say Hallyu has attained great popularity in ASEAN. The same can be said about the fandom of Hallyu.\u201d The fandom of Kpop \u2014 which is part of the Korean Wave \u2014 has been known to be loyal in promoting their artists through good causes such as donating to disaster victims. ASEAN-Korea Center (AKC) secretary-general Lee Hyuk said during his keynote speech at the one-day ASEAN-Korea Media Forum to Bring the ASEAN Wave to Korea in Seoul on Wednesday that the Korean Wave had served as a firm foundation for the robust ASEAN-Korea partnership over the decades. \u201cThis year, marking the 30th\u00a0Anniversary of the ASEAN-Korea Dialogue Relations, the center now seeks to\u00a0go beyond the \u2018one-way\u2019 Korean Wave and bring \u2018two-way\u2019 ASEAN-Korean Waves through the active socio-cultural exchanges between ASEAN and Korea,\u201d he said.  \u201cASEAN is the second-largest market after East Asia, five times bigger than the North American market and 10 times that of Europe.\u201d  The forum was attended by 30 representatives from ASEAN and the media \u2014 including members of the Asia News Network (ANN) \u2014 to get together to explore greater partnership for promoting ASEAN-Korea exchanges. Apart from Lee, Korea Herald CEO & publisher Kwon Choong-won, Malaysian Ambassador to Korea Dato\u2019 Mohd Ashri Muda and executive director of the 2019 ASEAN-ROK Commemorative Summit Preparatory Office Suh Jeong-in also delivered their remarks. \u201cThe ASEAN-Korea Center will continue to work with media stakeholders in bringing the peoples of the two regions closer and foster their mutual understanding,\u201d Lee said. Kim Youn-sung, director of the Star Collabo platform planning team, shared his experience on the production of hit dramas such as\u00a0Mr. Sunshine, Descendants of the Sun\u00a0and\u00a0Goblin\u00a0\u2014 which are popular in ASEAN countries, including Indonesia. \u201cThere is an increasing demand [for Korean dramas] in the ASEAN market. We can collaborate well [with ASEAN countries] and the AKC can be the hub for cultural exchanges for both parties,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe in the coming years, [collaborative] content from ASEAN countries will be accepted by Korean people.\u201d However, the mainstream media had been reluctant to provide Hallyu content for their readers. \u201cWhen Kpop groups like TVXQ, Super Junior and Big Bang started having concerts in ASEAN countries, then the mainstream media started to cover Kpop,\u201d said June Wong, chief special projects officer of Malaysian-based\u00a0The Star. Herself a Korean drama fan and an ARMY (nickname for BTS fans), Wong shared how the mainstream media was losing to social media when it came to the Korean Wave. She added that covering Kpop did not provide revenue to the media industry, which was another hurdle. But Bae \u201cKenny\u201d Kihyung, senior producer of KBS World Channel and Content, said the popularity of the Korean Wave coincided with the growing acceptance of social media networks. \u201cThe growth of social media has created the environment for the global phenomenon of Kpop,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Korean Wave industry keeps an ecosystem where it can continuously spread globally. It\u2019s just like Korean dramas \u2014 such as\u00a0Winter Sonata\u00a0which was popular in 2002 \u2014 that has continued gaining popularity with the recent hit\u00a0Descendants of the Sun, which was popular globally in 2016,\u201d Bae added. The ASEAN-Korea Media Forum was a kick-off event of the festivities that the AKC is planning throughout this year, which marks the 30th Anniversary of ASEAN-Korea Relations and the 10th\u00a0anniversary of its establishment. Under the theme \u201cMy ASEAN\u201d, the AKC will host events including the ASEAN Week in June, the ASEAN Train in October and the ASEAN-Korea Export-Import Fair in November. \u00a9 2016 - 2023 PT.
