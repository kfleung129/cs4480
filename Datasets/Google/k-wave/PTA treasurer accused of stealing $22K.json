    "text": "LOUISVILLE, KY (WAVE) - An officer of a Parent Teacher Association at a Jefferson County Public School is facing charges that she stole money from the organization. On Feb. 26, Elizabeth Walmer, 37, of Louisville, was charged with theft by deception. The arrest citation says Walmer was acting as the treasurer of the Layne Elementary School's PTA and used the debit card of the organization for her personal use. [ ] According to the report Walmer used the debit card to withdraw funds from the PTA account at PNC Bank at an ATM and to pay her personal bills. She is also accused of buying merchandise at various stores for her own use. The citation says Walmer also wrote checks made payable to her boyfriend and took cash from PTA fundraising events that she was to deposit in the bank. The loss to the PTA was approximately $22,500. The 15th District PTA, which oversees Layne Elementary's PTA, got word of the missing money when the bank contacted the school notifying them that the account had been overdrawn. The missing money has put activities meant for children in jeopardy. \"They have field day coming up, 5th grade promotion and these kids are still counting on these events going on,\" said Heather Wampler, the 15th District PTA President. The 15th district PTA is working with Layne Elementary to make sure these events go on for the kids. \"They should not suffer for an adult taking money from kids,\" said Wampler. A letter went home with students to notify parents of the incident. Walmer is not an employee of JCPS. Walmer was in court on March 30. A plea of not guilty was entered by the judge and Walmer was appointed a public defender. She is scheduled to appear back in court on May 22. Copyright 2015 WAVE 3 News. All rights reserved. ",
