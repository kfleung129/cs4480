    "text": " By \n\n\tPatrick Frater Asia Bureau Chief Surprising as it may sound, the Korean film industry has had a rough time over the past couple of years. Get ready for a comeback. Just at a moment when Korean film producers might have expected to capitalize on the unprecedented multi-Oscar success of \u201cParasite\u201d (and the previous year\u2019s Korean-language \u201cMinari,\u201d COVID closed down Korean cinemas , stifled production and extinguished Korean audiences\u2019 willingness to venture into cinemas. Pre-COVID, South Korea had been the world\u2019s fourth-largest theatrical market, but for two years has been in an abyss. That the Korean film industry has an undiminished capacity for delivering high-quality pictures is amply on display in Cannes, where the country has four starkly different titles: \u201cDecision to Leave,\u201d a meticulous detective mystery from maestro Park Chan-wook; \u201cBroker,\u201d an issues-driven drama made in Korea by Japan\u2019s former Palme d\u2019Or winner Kore-eda Hirokazu; a convoluted 1980s-set spy actioner from \u201cSquid Game\u201d star Lee Jung-jae, making his feature directing debut; and an understated and introspective drama, \u201cNext Sohee,\u201d from Cannes returnee Jung July.  But back home, cinema chains have lost vast sums of money over the past two years and\u00a0 distributors reacted to the new conditions by halting local releases. Last year\u2019s \u201cEmergency Declaration,\u201d showcased at Cannes, is still unreleased at home and joins a backlog of over 100 completed movies awaiting a release. As a result, Korean films\u2019 market share collapsed to levels not seen for 10 years. Korean films\u2019 gross revenues tumbled from some KRW970 billion ($776 million) in 2019 to just KRW173 billion ($138 million) in 2021. The film industry is now hoping for a trickle-down effect from Korea\u2019s other creative sectors \u2014 music, TV drama, cosmetics and food \u2014 that will speed its revival. \u201cOne of the first things I did after getting the job was to change the industry\u2019s branding. No more \u2018Korean Cinema.\u2019 Instead, we should call ourselves \u2018K-Movies,\u2019 \u201d said Korean Film Council (KOFIC) chairman Park Ki-yong. \u201cIt fits with the times.\u201d Korea\u2019s stand in the Cannes International Village has been appropriately rebadged. K-Movies\u2019 comeback is also likely to have a more international flavor, as foreign filmmakers come to Korea to co-produce or make local productions. On the eve of his departure for Cannes, Kore-eda said that it was his \u201clong-time dream\u201d to make a film in Korea. \u201cI\u2019d met superb Korean actors like Song Kang-ho, Gang Dong-won and Bae Doo-na in many film festivals and have kept in close touch with them for a long time.\u201d  Director Mike Figgis says the quality of Korean actors \u2014 especially its female talent \u2014 was among the key reasons he committed to helm \u201cShame,\u201d his anticipated venture into Korean filmmaking. \u201cMainly through Netflix, about two years ago I watched lots of Korean dramas. I was intrigued by the style of Korean filmmaking,\u201d said Figgis in Busan, shortly before the pandemic. \u201cSo, 15 months ago I decided to buy a plane ticket to Korea.\u201d Figgis is not alone in being swept up by Korean contemporary culture. France\u2019s Denis Dercourt recently released his Korean-set crime drama \u201cVanishing\u201d with a mixed French and Korean cast and crew. And Davy Chou\u2019s Un Certain Regard film \u201cReturn to Seoul\u201d is a French-German-Belgian co-production focused on an adopted woman\u2019s rediscovery of her roots in Korea. \u201cI could see the huge cultural impact Korea has had on everything in Asia. When you travel in Asia, you see how people listen to current Korean music and watch Korean films. It was a phenomenon that was only happening in Asia a few years ago, but now it\u2019s just everywhere,\u201d Chou says. While making \u201cReturn to Seoul,\u201d Chou said that he felt in awe of K-movies\u2019 biggest names. \u201cI firmly believe that Hong Sang-soo, Li Chang-dong and Bong Joon Ho are really some of the very best directors in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is such an abundance of talent here. It is a miracle. There\u2019s no reason this Korean wave cannot continue for another five or 10 years,\u201d says Lee Jooick, a veteran producer at the forefront of an earlier Korean wave in the early 2000s. \u201cThose in the U.S. who thought \u2018Gangnam Style\u2019 was a one-off now listen to BTS and Blackpink on their radio. On the TV front, Korean formats such as \u2018I Can See Your Voice\u2019 and \u2018The Masked Singer\u2019 are now everywhere in the world. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of a show like \u2018Pachinko,\u2019 which I was not involved with personally, but demonstrates the versatility of Koreans, Korean-Americans and Korean-Japanese.\u201d Lee adds. After a crushing fifth wave of COVID in the first months of 2022, the Korean domestic industry can finally feel that the comeback may be tangible. \u201cThe Roundup,\u201d a crime action film fronted by the Korean-American Don Lee (aka Ma Dong-seok) is doing outstanding business. Released in cinemas on Wednesday, it has already clocked up $8.1 million of business in two days. Its international sales agent K-Movie has had no problem licensing it to over 130 territories.
