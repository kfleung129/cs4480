    "text": "Departments More Connect With Us  Editor\u2019s\u00a0Note: Through our partnership with the Honolulu Museum of Art, HONOLULU Magazine publishes a monthly blog written by\u00a0Lesa\u00a0Griffith, the museum\u2019s communications director and a talented Hawai\u2018i writer on arts, culture and food.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nOur Love Story is a tender romance that also pushes social boundaries.\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Honolulu Museum of Art presents annual cultural film festivals, and with each year, attendees can see a country\u2019s cinematic language evolve. For example the Bollywood Film Festival includes fewer musical spectaculars and more serious high-production dramas. This year\u2019s Korean Cinema series, screening now through Sept. 23, is chock full of hits that address serious topics such as political corruption, the 1980s Gwangju uprising, a lesbian awakening and North Korean relations. It even includes Gook\u2014the acclaimed Korean-American production that looks at racism in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt\u2019s been two decades since Hallyu\u2014the Korean Wave\u2014washed over the world, and there is so much more to it than K-dramas now. Next up in the series, on Sept. 14 and 17, is the indie production Our Love Story, about a female art graduate student who falls in love for the first time\u2014with a female bartender. In a socially conservative country where homosexuality is still criminalized, the film is a milestone for Korean cinema.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nStar-studded The Battleship Island is an epic World War II escape film.\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe series goes from intimate indie to epic blockbuster with The Battleship Island, featuring an all-star cast that includes Hwang Jung Min (Ode to My Father, The Himalayas) and Song Joong Ki (Descendants of the Sun). It\u2019s takes place on coal-rich Hashima Island (which was also the creepy, crumbling lair of Javier Bardem in Skyfall), where the Japanese put hundreds of Koreans into forced labor. It\u2019s a World War II great-escape thriller.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nJustin Chon\u2019s Gook, an exploration of race relations between Korean Americans and African Americans, took a top prize at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival.\n\u00a0\n\n\nAnd for the first time the Korean Cinema series includes an American production\u2014Justin Chon\u2019s Gook, which won the NEXT Audience Award at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival. Focusing on two Korean-American brothers in Los Angeles in 1992, the film explores race relations that are just as complex and heated 25 years later.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSee the full schedule.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLesa Griffith is director of communications at the Honolulu Museum of Art.
