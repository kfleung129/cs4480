    "text": "Where else would you be able to get a Pharrell Williams sweatshirt for only S$39 after discount? Fans hoping to get VIP tickets to G-Dragon\u2019s upcoming solo concert in Singapore will have to pay S$1,000 each. Plus, it doesn't mean you'll be guaranteed one if you have the moolah \u2014 there are only 20 tickets available. The VIP tickets come with a meet-and-greet session with the 25-year-old singer and leader of popular K-pop group Big Bang. This is by far the most expensive VIP ticket for a K-pop event and it costs even higher than the \u201cSuper VIP Experience Package\u201d ticket for this November\u2019s MBC Korean Music Wave festival, which is tagged at S$688 each. Organisers of FIDe fashion week announced this just days after revealing that another South Korean star, Rain, will be making an appearance at the 11-day fashion event happening at The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. Meanwhile, a standard ticket for G-Dragon\u2019s solo concert happening on 12 October costs S$120 each. All tickets go on sale on Tuesday. G-Dragon, whose real name is Kwon Ji Young, was in Singapore just two weeks ago, performing together with his group, Big Bang, as part of an opening concert for the Formula One Singapore Grand Prix at the Padang. Hungarian Victoria Secret model, Barbara Palvin, 20, will also be coming to Singapore for the fashion festival, organisers said.
