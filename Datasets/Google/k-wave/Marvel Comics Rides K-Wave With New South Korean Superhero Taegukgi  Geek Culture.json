    "text": "With the K-wave phenomenon spreading across the globe, Marvel Comics is leaping on the trend with a new South Korean superhero in the latest February issue of the comic series \u201cTaskmaster\u201d. \u201cTaegukgi\u201c, named after the Korean flag makes his first appearance in the third issue of \u201cTaskmaster\u201d written by Jed Mackay and illustrated by Alessandro Vitti. The issue delves into Taskmaster\u2019s trip to South Korea following the death of Maria Hill in an attempt to clear his name before confronting Taegukgi. Taegukgi\u2019s abilities are still yet to be fully unveiled even though he seems to take punches quite easily. His powers will likely be explored further in the next issue. With so many popular South Korean superheroes like Amadeus Cho (Brawn) and Cindy Moon (Silk) already in the fray, Taegukgi definitely won\u2019t be the last project Marvel Comics is working on to ride on the K-wave. Zheng Yi is perpetually looking for the Time Stone to juggle his love for toys, anime, comics, gaming and photography. He probably needs the Space Stone next for his collection\u2026 Maybe we all need a little bit of time off from superhero films. A crossover of epic proportions.
