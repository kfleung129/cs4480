Defreitas told NBC News that she started watching Korean dramas only a few years ago, despite not speaking the language, when her cousin introduced her. \u201cAt first I was sharing an account, but I ended up getting my own because I was watching so much,\u201c Defreitas said. \u201cThe comments section is usually pretty fun. It\u2019s a little like a community.\u201d Korean dramas have inspired Defreitas to learn the language, and she wants to teach in Korea after she graduates. She said she continues to watch Korean dramas because it offers something \u201cdifferent.\u201d She's not the only one who's been caught in the Korean wave. According to data analytics company comScore, DramaFever had 2.4 million unique visitors in November 2016. According to the company, its users stream 800 million minutes of content a month. Ji-Yeon Yuh, a professor of Asian-American Studies at Northwestern University, told NBC News that \"structural factors that facilitate global consumption\" \u2014 such as the internet \u2014 have allowed Korean dramas to find a wider international audience.

For Amy Lau, a 15-year-old high school student, the dramas were something she \u201cgrew up watching\u201d because of her mother, Aida Qyu, who has been a longtime fan. \u201cThe earliest drama I remember watching was 2002, \u2018Winter Sonata,\u2019\u201d Lau told NBC News. \u201cThe theme song was like my childhood lullaby.\u201d She and her mother now enjoy watching the programs together, and are currently watching \u201cGoblin,\u201d one of the most unprecedentedly popular television dramas in South Korean history, according to the Korea Times. Qyu laments that the current show schedule isn\u2019t enough to fulfill her needs. \u201cOne week is only two episodes. If it were five, that would be good.\u201d Qyu said. \u201cYou know, maybe seven would be really good.\u201d For Lau and Qyu, neither of whom speak Korean, subtitles are necessary and were more difficult to find before websites like DramaFever and Viki, another streaming site, began operations. DramaFever offers international dramas on both free and paid subscription plans, similar to Hulu, and was acquired by Warner Brothers earlier in early 2016. It estimated that approximately 500 people attended its pop-up event to celebrate the release of \u201cGoblin.\u201d https://www.instagram.com/p/BNH4F_rjOMm According to the company, the majority of DramaFever\u2019s user base is largely women of color. Of its female viewers, DramaFever found that 43 percent of them were white, 27 percent Latino, 24 percent Asian and 17 percent black. DramaFever offers shows from Europe and Latin America in addition to its Asian content, but Jacqueline Sia, the company's director of video operations, told NBC News, \u201cKorean dramas take the cake. Asian dramas are really what people are looking for right now.\u201d In order to satisfy growing international demand for these dramas, Sia and the DramaFever team translate the shows in-house, adding subtitles in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and simplified Chinese, and releasing them in as little as 24 hours after original broadcast. \"I think it really counts a lot,\u201d Sia said. \u201cInstead of going to pirated sites, with ads and everything, people come here for a clean experience.\u201d The popularity of Korean dramas has also made them a prime target for American adaptions. Korean-American actor Daniel Dae Kim\u2019s production company announced it was putting three pilots into development last year \u2014 two of them were adaptations of successful Korean dramas. (One of the shows, \"The Good Doctor,\" received a pilot order from ABC this week.) \u201cI personally feel don\u2019t remake any of these shows, because I\u2019m a fan of the original, but I also appreciate that they\u2019re trying to tell these stories,\u201d Sia said. She noted that the dramas picked up for adaptation, such as \u201cMy Love From Another Star,\u201d which broke records last year and tells the story of an alien falling in love with a human, are \u201cuniversal.\u201d \u201cThose are very universal stories. They don\u2019t have to be Korean,\" she said. \"I think they picked good stories to remake, so more power to them. And if people are interested in the original, they can come to DramaFever.\u201d Follow NBC Asian America on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr. \u00a9\u00a02023 NBC UNIVERSAL ",
