Fandoms are big for the company, Sutaria said. As such, WAVE.tv has created a portfolio of media brands that cater to them with programming for specific sports genres. \u201cWe have about 18 fandoms right now and want to expand that,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are also building quality sports content and revenue-adjacent opportunities such as sports betting, gaming and e-sports.\u201d Since 2017, Sutaria and Verne have grown the team to 42 people. Sutaria expects to add at least 18 more by the end of the year. WAVE.tv became profitable in the latter half of 2019 and has doubled its revenue between 2019 and 2020, Sutaria said. \u201cAs we continue to build audiences and sign on rights partners, we will extend the classic sports sponsorship advertising opportunity so they can reach the same consumers, but do it for folks spending most of their time on digital,\u201d he added.
