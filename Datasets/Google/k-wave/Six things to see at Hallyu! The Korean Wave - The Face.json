    "text": "Aespa \"Next Level\" MV, 2021 \u00a9 SM Entertainment The V&A\u2019s new immersive exhibition celebrates our collective obsession with Korean music, film and design. Here are the six pieces to hone in on when visiting. Words: Kyle MacNeill8th December 2022 We\u2019ve long been surfing the Korean Wave on the silver screen, small screen and even smaller screen. In the last two decades, K\u2011pop has become huge thanks to endlessly-stanned groups like BTS, EXO and Blackpink, generating a\u00a0cool $10bn for South Korea every single year. Then there\u2019s Korean film \u2013 including mega crossover hits like Parasite, The Housemaid and Oldboy \u2013 and K\u2011drama, from Squid Game to the equally dystopian Dr. Brain and a\u00a0heck of a\u00a0lot of flesh-munching zombie flicks in between. It\u2019s all part of Hallyu, meaning, literally, wave or flow of Korea, which describes this recent international spread and interest in Korea\u2019s pop culture. Actively pursued by the Korean government, which allocates a\u00a0significant chunk of funding each year to its cultural sector, Hallyu\u2019s upgraded to its 3.0 era and we\u2019re all into K\u2011fashion\u2019s high-end streetwear, we\u2019ve applied ourselves to the gorgeous luminosity of K\u2011beauty and eaten vats of kimchi. Whack a \u200b\u2018K\u2019 in front of any potential creative export and it\u2019s probably already struck gold; it\u2019s why THE FACE has been obsessed, tracking our infatuation with the country\u2019s unstoppable cultural domination. Now, we\u2019ve been gifted with an IRL experience thanks to the V&A\u2019s new Hallyu! The Korean Wave exhibition. Open now until 25th June 2023, it\u2019s an exceptional showcase spanning music, film, technology, style and art in bright, loud, maximalist fashion. From reconstructed bathrooms to painted sculptures that have elicited actual liquid tears, here are the six pieces you cannot miss. An entire K\u2011pop room Who\u2019s your bias? Here\u2019s a\u00a0chance to decide in an entire room dedicated to the world of K\u2011pop. Don\u2019t miss the No Filter video, which showcases all-singing, all-dancing, hard-to-believe-they\u2019re-not-real idols, ETERN1TY, generated by AI. Elsewhere you\u2019ll find the costumes worn by Aespa and Ateez in the music videos for Next Level and Fireworks. If you still want more, there\u2019s a\u00a0booth where you can learn dance moves to PSY\u2019s That That for pure TikTok gold. \"What you see is the unseen - Chandeliers for Five Cities\" by Kyungah Ham \u00a9\u202fKyungah Ham.

Photo by Chunho An What You See is the Unseen /\u200bChandeliers for Five Cities Kyungah Ham\u200b\u2019s hand-embroidered chandeliers are woven using gossamer silk thread and are the result of a\u00a0secret, ongoing collaboration between artists in North and South Korea. First inspired by finding a\u00a0North Korean propaganda flyer lying on the street of her parents\u2019 Seoul neighbourhood in 2008, the artist started smuggling her designs to artisans living in the north who would embroider them with super fine stitching before smuggling them back. The artworks represent Korea\u2019s unique, divided political situation. Untitled G\u2011Dragon, A\u00a0Space of No Name Osang Gwon\u200b\u2019s larger-than-life-size painted sculpture is based on Raphael\u2019s 1518 renaissance painting St. Michael Vanquishing Satan. The sculptor has depicted Korean rapper G\u2011Dragon as both St. Michael and Satan in three metres of glittering beauty. If you needed proof that this artwork is moving; a\u00a0visiting G\u2011Dragon superfan literally wept at the sight of it. Original costumes from Squid Game Oh Squid Game how we miss you! It\u2019s somehow already been a\u00a0year since the K\u2011drama rewrote the rulebook and amassed 1.65 billion viewing hours during its first month on Netflix, getting us all hooked on its gruesome premise and rich characterisation. Now, there\u2019s a\u00a0chance to see the original highlighter-pink and forest-green costumes \u2013 much better than last year\u2019s many Hallyuween efforts \u2013 in all their glory. Make sure you don\u2019t bump into The Recruiter on your way out\u2026 A recreation of the Parasite bathroom Ask the gallery assistant where the bathroom is and you might be led here: an IRL recreation of the bathroom from Parasite, that insanely good, anxiety-inducing Best Picture winner. The installation feels like a\u00a0portal into the hit Hallyuwood film; the distinctive tiled stairs leading up to a\u00a0knackered toilet (the best place to get signal!), flickering lightbulb and mass of bric-a-brac goods all transport you straight to the Kim\u2019s family home. Miss Sohee\u2019s Peony Dress Seoul-born, London-based designer Miss Sohee is one of the most exciting fashion forces right now thanks to her couture gowns and backing from the likes of Zendaya and Taylor Hill. It\u2019s little wonder, then, that she features here; her Peony Dress is a\u00a0masterclass in puffy silhouettes and artistic flamboyance, showcased in all its rhubarby glory as part of the exhibition\u2019s fashion section. Catch its blooming beauty next to streetstyle from the likes of Kye and D\u2011Antidote, contemporary versions of the traditional Korean outfit hanbok and a\u00a0behind-the-scenes look at pieces worn by BTS.
