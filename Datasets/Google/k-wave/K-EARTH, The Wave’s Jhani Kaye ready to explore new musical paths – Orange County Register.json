Kevin Ryder, left, and Gene \"Bean\" Baxter were No. 1 with listeners in the 25-54 age range.  According to the latest Arbitron ratings, Ryan Seacrest was No. 1 among listeners ages 18-14.  Veteran newsman John Brooks recently retired from KFWB and KNX.  Program director Jhani Kaye, who has helmed the programming at K-EARTH and The Wave, says he's ready to explore other options.  It\u2019s rare when a station program director becomes almost as well-known as the on-air talent, but that has marked the Los Angeles career of Jhani Kaye, first at Clear Channel, then, starting in 2006, at K-EARTH and KTWV. But now he feels ready to explore new passions, though he won\u2019t reveal the details yet. Steve Carver, senior vice president for CBS stations in L.A. said in a recent announcement: \u201cFor the past seven years we have been fortunate to work alongside Jhani Kaye as he helmed the programming efforts at The WAVE and K-EARTH. He has made a number of important contributions that have distinguished the stations among its peers and been a valued member of the team. As he nears the end of his current agreement with CBS Radio, Jhani has elected to explore fresh challenges and new opportunities using his multifaceted talents and unmatched passion for music\u201d Said Kaye: \u201cI\u2019m really going to miss our family here at K-EARTH/The WAVE. Luckily, I\u2019m committed to CBS through the end of June and am devoting myself to a smooth transition for them.\u201d We will interview Kaye as it gets closer to his departure. SURVEY SAYS It\u2019s time for some new radio surveys, so here\u2019s this week\u2019s question: What is your favorite song to hear and your least favorite, regardless of format? Keep your answers brief and include your name. My email address is at the end of this column. BROOKS RETIRES Veteran newsman John Brooks recently retired from KFWB and KNX. He started at KFWB in 1979. Alan Oda recently interviewed Brooks for laradio.com. Here are excerpts: \u201cI always hoped to be a bit irreverent and crazy like Hunter Thompson, yet true to the facts and accurate as Walter Cronkite and CBS News. There should always be an element of entertainment in news when it is appropriate because people are choosing to listen to your station, but you can\u2019t cross the line into fantasy.\u201d Pete Demetriou shared his high praise for his longtime colleague at KFWB and KNX. \u201cThere\u2019s a hidden joke somewhere in Brooks\u2019 stories that you figure out about five seconds after his reports. The man is solid and is one of the most prepared journalists ever. He\u2019ll take everything thrown at him, yet sound so smooth on the air as if he\u2019d spent 15 minutes rehearsing his report. \u201cJohn has a depth of knowledge about everything \u2013 about politics, about history, about current events. He knows music, from classical to classic rock \u2013 he\u2019ll pull up a song lyric from memory and apply it to his report when appropriate.\u201d Demetriou adds that Brooks knows how to get the best out of his interviews. \u201cHe\u2019s developed as a professional a way of making who he\u2019s talking to become quickly comfortable and willing to answer anything he asks.\u201d KSPA CHANGES Here is the new weekend music schedule for KSPA 1510 AM and 1450 AM: Saturday 11 a.m.-1 p.m. \u2013 \u201cCar Pros\u201d 1-3 p.m. \u2013 \u201cJazz at the Spa\u201d 3-4 p.m. \u2013 \u201cForgotten Hollywood\u201d 4-6 p.m. \u2013 \u201cBig Band Jump\u201d Sunday 11 a.m.-noon \u2013 \u201cCar Pros\u201d Noon-2 p.m. \u2013 \u201cSounds of Sinatra\u201d 2-4 p.m. \u2013 \u201cRadio Deluxe\u201d 4-6 p.m. \u2013 \u201cJazz at the Spa\u201d \u201cJazz at the Spa\u201d features the big-band music of Matt Catingub.
