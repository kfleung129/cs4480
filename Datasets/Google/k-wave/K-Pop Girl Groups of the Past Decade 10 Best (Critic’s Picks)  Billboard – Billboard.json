    "text": "Billboard took a look back at the top Korean girl groups of the past decade for Girl Group Week 2017. By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tTamar Herman Since the late \u201990s, when the original K-pop girl groups S.E.S, Baby V.O.X and Fin.K.L dominated airwaves, Korea has produced a bevy of talented female acts. Since it\u2019s Girl Group Week here at Billboard, it\u2019s time to take a look back at the teams of women who have had the most impact on the K-pop industry over the past decade. 10. miss A From their unconventional debut single \u201cBad Girl Good Girl\u201d to the aggressive bubblegum synth of their most recent track \u201cOnly You,\u201d miss A has been one of the most forward-thinking K-pop acts. Paying homage to Destiny\u2019s Child with their Independent Women Part III EP and its anthem of a single \u201cI Don\u2019t Need a Man,\u201d this former quartet \u2014 Jia left in 2016 and the group hasn\u2019t released anything together since 2015 \u2014 is one of of K-pop\u2019s most empowering acts of the decade. Related\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEmerging Markets, Revenue Streams, Track IDs & Beyonc\u00e9: 10 Takeaways From ADE 2023\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t07/12/2017  9. Apink Saccharine and lighthearted, this girl group has played it straight since 2011 and seen immense success because of it. While the Korean music industry saw a surge of more dominating, girl-power-focused female acts in the early 2010s, when Apink was starting out, the act stood out for their breezy pop tracks and innocent style. Though their international presence is less than that of some other acts on this list, Apink remains one of South Korea\u2019s most popular girl groups and has had a softening influence on many newer K-pop groups, with younger acts (Lovelyz, Gfriend, April, etc.) veering toward lighthearted girlishness.  8. 4Minute With rapper HyunA at at its epicenter, 4Minute\u00a0thrived on brash electropop songs during the first half of their career, before experimenting a bit with their sound later on for some funky hip-hop (\u201cWhat\u2019s Your Name?,\u201d \u201cWhatcha Doin\u2019 Today?\u201d) and melancholic pop ballads (\u201cCold Rain\u201d). As their career approached its end, they dropped \u201cCrazy,\u201d one of the most dynamic songs K-pop has seen in the past decade, before ending with the Skrillex-crafted EDM swan song \u201cHate.\u201d   7. f(x) f(x)\u2019s effervescent brand of electronica and synthpop is both innovative and extremely accessible to non-K-pop fans, with albums like Pink Tape, Red Light and 4 Walls setting this quartet (formerly a fivesome) firmly apart from any other girl group K-pop has seen this decade. Unlike many Korean acts, f(x) has focused on full-length albums rather than EPs and filled them with decadent pop tracks.  6. Kara Back in the day, few acts could compare to Kara. With propulsive beats and layered synths, Kara reigned with hits like \u201cMister,\u201d \u201cStep\u201d and \u201cLupin.\u201d The girl group\u2019s legacy rests on being one of the most impactful K-pop acts in Japan; with their addicting songs, Kara dominated Japanese charts and became the first female foreign act to hold a show at the Tokyo Dome. Breaking into the second largest music industry in the world was no small feat, and Kara was considered a leader of the Korean wave\u2019s heyday of the early \u201910s.   5. After School and subunit Orange Caramel There are few other acts in Korea who put their all into their performances the way After School did in the first few years of their career. Whether it was transforming into a marching band during promotions for their punchy electropop jam \u201cBang\u201d or emoting the sorrow of sleek synthpop track \u201cFirst Love\u201d through interpretive pole dancing, few upped the stakes of K-pop presentation as much as this act. And what After School didn\u2019t do, their quirky subunit Orange Caramel \u2014 featuring members Nana, Lizzy, and Raina \u2014 did. Becoming human sushi was all in a day\u2019s work for this group, whose ethos rests on being bizarrely cute. Neither After School nor Orange Caramel have released any new music in Korea since 2014, but their impact is still felt.  4. Brown Eyed Girls Though they began in 2006 as a vocal act that hid its faces from the public, Brown Eyed Girls\u00a0came out from behind the mics and has spent much of the last decade as\u00a0K-pop\u2019s most innovative musical act. With conceptually driven pop songs that exude power, the quartet \u2014 K-pop\u2019s longest-running girl group without any member changes \u2014 is always happy to push the envelope a bit. They\u2019ve done everything from promoting free speech in \u201cSixth Sense\u201d to reveling in female sexuality with \u201cWarm Hole,\u201d but it was their arrogantly sexy 2009 hit \u201cAbracadabra,\u201d a new-wave electropop track, that carved out Brown Eyed Girls\u2019 place in K-pop history.   3. Wonder Girls One of the most resilient groups in the industry before their break-up at the beginning of this year, Wonder Girls dominated South Korea with their modernized retropop sound. Hits like \u201cTell Me\u201d and \u201cNobody\u201d were some of K-pop\u2019s first-ever viral successes, and, following a failed attempt at breaking into the U.S. market and some lineup changes, the group\u2019s band-oriented Reboot in 2015 is one of the most impactful and successful rebrandings K-pop has ever seen. It resulted in late-in-career greats, with the synthpop slow burn \u201cI Feel You\u201d and the psychedelic \u201cWhy So Lonely\u201d enabling Wonder Girls to end things on an extremely positive note.  2. 2NE1 The \u201cI Am the Best\u201d quartet dominated K-pop with their fierce charisma from day one with first single \u201cFire\u201d in 2009. 2NE1\u2019s hard-hitting hip-pop styling launched a career that brought the act to astronomical heights, and they paved the way for a more empowered side to K-pop girl groups. Between their pump-up jams and more vulnerable tracks, like \u201cUgly\u201d and \u201cLonely,\u201d 2NE1 endeared the singers to K-pop fans around the world. Though they struggled to move forward after peaking and were on hiatus between 2014 and their breakup track early this year, 2NE1\u2019s final album, 2014\u2019s Crush, was the highest-ranked Korean album on the Billboard 200 for two years until it was beaten last October by BTS\u2019 Wings.  1. Girls\u2019 Generation Going strong 10 years into their career, Girls\u2019 Generation are undisputed K-pop royalty. Formerly a nine-member group, the eight women of Girls\u2019 Generation are well into their 20s but still charm South Korea regularly with their tightly produced pop songs and vibrant femininity.  Living up to their name, Taeyeon, Tiffany, Sooyoung, Seohyun, YoonA, Yuri, Hyoyeon, Sunny and former member Jessica Jung shaped a generation of K-pop girl groups when the bubbly \u201cGee\u201d became Korea\u2019s undisputed hit of 2009. Since then, the Girls have stayed true to their classic sound, coming up with ebullient hook-driven singles (\u201cHoot,\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d \u201cParty,\u201d etc.) and redirecting K-pop\u2019s sonic styling with hits like their slinky \u201cTell Me Your Wish (Genie)\u201d and the legendary genre-blending whirlwind that is \u201cI Got a Boy.\u201d More recently, they\u2019ve tried out a few more dramatic sounds, like EDM on \u201cCatch Me If You Can\u201d and bold brass on \u201cYou Think\u201d but still maintained the refreshing attitude that made them Korea\u2019s reigning pop queens. Though they\u2019ve been around for years and members have pursued their own careers on the side \u2014 some act, some are solo artists \u2014\u00a0Girls\u2019 Generation aren\u2019t showing any signs of slowing down: The girl group is planning to drop a special album in August to commemorate their 10th anniversary.
