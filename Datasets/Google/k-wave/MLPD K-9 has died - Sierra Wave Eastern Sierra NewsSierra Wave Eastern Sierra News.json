Brutus was a Czech Shephard born in Checkslovakia in March 2002.\u00a0 Following a fundraising effort that raised over $20,000 in 2004, Brutus was purchasaed from Alderhorst International in Riverside after being hand-selected for Mammoth Lakes by Alderhorst ownerhand Dave Reaver.\u00a0 The MLPD was looking for a well mannered and well tempered p\u00f3lice dog trained in both patrol/apprehension and narcotics detection.\u00a0 Mr. Reaver recommended Brutus because he believed he would\u00a0 be the best fit for Mammoth Lakes. Officer Dan Casabian was Brutus\u2019s K-9 handler partner.\u00a0 They worked together for five years during which Brutus was involved in several notable incidents. He tracked and located an attempted murder suspect after a more than one mile search.\u00a0 He searched for and located many firearms and other evidence that was discarded or hidden by fleeing felons.\u00a0 He searched and located large amounts of drugs from drug dealers.\u00a0 Brutus was also responsible for the recovery of large amounts of illegal drug money. \u00a0 But most of all, Brutus protected the men and women of the MLPD and members of the community. Brutus was retired in 2009 and spent the rest of his life with Officer Casabian and his three children.\u00a0 Officer Casabian said, \u201cProtecting his family was just as important as protecting his community.\u00a0 He will be greatly missed by all.\u00a0 He was my partner, best friend, and family member.\u00a0 Rest in peace, buddy!\u201d Of. CASABIAN and Family- Very sorry for the loss of BRUTUS. When a friend leaves, he leaves an empty space that the arrival of another friend cannot fill. Maybe some day another doggie will be so lucky as BRUTUS to share his life with you and your family. Our prayers\u2026\u00a0Read more \u00bb Thank you for your service, Brutus. very sad news. My thoughts to the MLPD, Ofc Casabian and his family. RIP Brutus may you run through the fields of heaven. Guess he didn\u2019t need a search warrant. Condolences to the Casabian family. RIP, Brutus. Your job was well done. I\u2019m more bothered about the death of a dog than the death of a human.   Enter your email address to subscribe to the news and receive notifications of new posts by email.
