    "text": "K-pop stars like G-Dragon, IU, B1A4, Teen Top, VIXX, Lee Seung Gi and more all made showings at KCON's deafening concert in Los Angeles. By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJeff Benjamin Saturday morning, the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena and its surrounding area was turned into a K-pop heaven with panels, workshops and a marketplace dedicated to all things \u201cHallyu\u201d (aka Korean wave). Throughout the first day of the convention, fans got to meet Ricky Luna (producer of Taeyang\u2019s \u201cRinga Linga\u201d) at\u00a0the Into a Music Producer\u2019s Mind panel,\u00a0learned the choreography to G-Dragon\u2019s \u201cCrooked\u201d at the Dance All Day tent and saw artists like VIXX, IU, B1A4 come say hi at fan events. But it was all leading up to the night\u2019s grand finale with a five-act concert that would be filmed for South Korea\u2019s K-pop music program show \u201cM COUNTDOWN,\u201d likened to a modern-day \u201cTRL\u201d but with live performances instead of music videos. Last year, KCON grew to two days of festivities, but ended the second day with a concert. This year, the K-pop fest split the 10 artists up for a concert each night, promising longer sets with each act performing five songs versus last year\u2019s three.

Girls\u2019 Generation, SPICA & More: See KCON Day 2\u2019s Lineup And while K-pop has become South Korea\u2019s hottest export, KCON isn\u2019t just about the music with the concert bringing out famous drama actor/singer Lee Seung Gi to join Im onstage for a few words. \u201cI hope there will be many more moments when we can meet,\u201d the\u00a0\u201cReturn\u201d singer\u00a0told the audience, in impressive English, while\u00a0emphasizing his excitement that fans were spreading Korean culture. Lee and Im hyped up the crowd with a video montage of the acts performing that night\u00a0\u2014 to deafening screams\u00a0\u2014 before rising boy band VIXX took the stage. VIXX opened up the concert with \u201cVoodoo Doll,\u201d their dark 2014 single, that kicked off the hit-heavy concert. From the opening number, it was clear KCON and the artists had actively planned to perform to every part of the audience on this atypical circle stage; the sextet even performed a full song on the less-filled north side. Despite a quick technical issue where one member\u2019s microphone went out mid-rap, the fans were screaming loud for this rookie group \u2013 especially when the boys whipped out a slew of sexy body rolls. (And that wouldn\u2019t be the last time fans got treated to body rolls. More on that later.) The show sped into a faster pace by quickly transitioning into IU for her first American performance. The 20-year-old began with her K-Pop Hot 100 No. 1 \u201cThe Red Shoes,\u201d moving through the big band-inspired number in a lacy, long-sleeve dress, red lipstick and, of course, red heels. IU looked calm moving through the jazzy number as well through the orchestral \u201cYou and I.\u201d  IU Playlist: Her Biggest Hits Including \u201cThe Red Shoes,\u201d \u201cYou and I\u201d and More \u201cIt\u2019s my first time having a stage in L.A. so I\u2019m really nervous,\u201d she told the audience, before adding that she\u2019s \u201cnot good in English,\u201d when she actually was quite natural-sounding. The stage lights dimmed and two enormous disco balls hung from the stage as she performed the easy-breezy \u201cFriday\u201d while walking around the stage to wave to concertgoers. The biggest surprise of the night came when Teen Top member Niel emerged from the bottom of the stage to handle the bridge, usually sang by Jang Yi Jeong of boy band HISTORY. IU\u2019s surprises didn\u2019t end there with a whole cheerleader team coming to accompany her on a rocky version of \u201cHey.\u201d Decked out in school boy-inspired outfits, boy band B1A4 hit the stage next for a goofy performance with on-point choreography of their One Direction-esque single \u201cWhat\u2019s Happening.\u201d \u00a0The guys turned down the funny charms to perform their synthy ballad \u201cLonely,\u201d before revving it right back up for \u201cSolo Day,\u201d that came complete with heel-clicking choreography. At one point, the boys whipped out super soakers to spray the much-delighted fan girls and boys while probably terrifying the pit photographers. B1A4 is currently planning a world tour and if this was a preview of what a full concert is like, attendees are in for a really fun show. Relive KCON 2013 With These 15 Big Moments Teen Top was next with the boy band following up their KCON 2013 performance that saw them premiere their K-Pop Top 10 hit \u201cRocking.\u201d Perhaps to showcase their growth since last year \u2013 that included concluding a world tour \u2013 the guys kicked off with the dance track looking extremely rested and serving an extremely polished performance. While the screams were huge upon their arrival to the stage, the sextet unleashed a slew of body rolls that set the stadium into a tizzy. The guys served on-point choreography throughout hits like \u201cMiss Right\u201d and \u201cCrazy,\u201d and, appropriately enough, later told the audience they wanted to express how happy they were through dancing \u2013 which was really just a few heel clicks, but still cute enough to elicit a banshee screams.  The concert looked great visually, but there were so many different points for the artists to look that if concertgoers wanted to watch from one of the four huge screens hanging in each corner of the stadium, their view was more than likely obstructed by multiple hanging wires or speakers. With that, some of the camera choices were odd with the broadcast at times moving to odd shots of members who were not singing or panning to audience members at moments when they were checking their phones. But little did that matter when it came time for headliner G-Dragon. While some fans in the upper rows were sitting for the other acts (Who could blame them? They had been in the SoCal sun for nearly 12 hours), it felt like most of the stadium rose for the BIGBANG member as the stadium chanted his name. Go Inside a G-Dragon Show With Exclusive Videos From His Last Tour The singer/rapper kicked off his set with the knocking hip-hop track \u201cOne of a Kind,\u201d smiling while moving through his raps and, at one point, spanking one of his female backup dancers \u2013 likely making fans wonder if he could get away with that in Korea. While G-Dragon also performed at KCON 2013 (and brought out Missy Elliott to premiere their collaboration), he hadn\u2019t released his \u201cCoup D\u2019Etat\u201d EPs and, thus, he kept this setlist focused on his newer material. He moved into EP tracks like the fizzy EDM banger \u201cGO,\u201d the melancholy piano-pop track \u201cWho You?\u201d and his take on British rock with \u201cCrooked\u201d \u2013 all to deafening screams. With bigger lights and loads of smoke shooting from the stage, G-Dragon undoubtedly had the most pyrotechnical set of the night and the 25-year-old looked elated, taking in the arena-sized love he was receiving. He asked the crowd, \u201cWhat\u2019s my name?\u201d when everyone obviously knew it, but the dude was lapping in his moment before humbly adding, \u201cIt\u2019s great to be here.\u201d  GD ended the set with his party-jam single \u201cCrayon\u201d that had the whole crowd shouting the addictive hook, \u201cGet your cray on!\u201d over the pounding beat. Confetti shot from the stage, flying down from the ceiling as the other Day 1 performers made their way back to the stage. All the artists gave respectful bows to G-Dragon upon seeing him, to which he returned, as they waved goodbye to fans one last time. B1A4 left the stage last cutely waving at the fans who were left even hungrier for Day 2 of KCON 2014.
