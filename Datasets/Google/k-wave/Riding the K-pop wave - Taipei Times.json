    "text": "When Tom Tsai (\u8521\u66dc\u7af9) collected the pay from his part-time jobs this summer, the 18-year-old shunned instant gratification for an investment in his future. He spent all NT$8,000 (US$262) of his earnings on a class teaching Korean pop music (or \u201cK-pop\u201d) performance techniques. \u201cI\u2019ve never come such a long way by myself to do something related to my dreams,\u201d the Taichung native told me in a music rehearsal studio in central Taipei. Tsai bears an uncanny resemblance to local singer-songwriter Crowd Lu (\u76e7\u5ee3\u4ef2), plays the erhu, piano and guitar and wants to write his own songs. It\u2019s easy to imagine him thriving in Taiwan\u2019s indie music scene. But Tsai, who does not (yet) dance or speak Korean, wants to be a K-pop idol. Photo: Davina Tham, Taipei Times Attracted by the international success of K-pop acts, young and aspiring performers are increasingly looking to K-pop training centers and auditions to make their dreams of stardom come true. This shift is also bringing changes to the development of Taiwan\u2019s Mandopop industry. KOREA RISING Full disclosure: I\u2019ve been a K-pop fan for the past 10 years. I\u2019ve bought albums and concert videos, waited at the airport to greet a boy band arriving on tour and stood outside the Seoul offices of SM Entertainment (one of K-pop\u2019s Big Three management agencies) in hopes of a celebrity sighting. Photo: Davina Tham, Taipei Times But this wasn\u2019t always the case. Throughout my youth in Singapore in the 1990s and early 2000s, Taiwanese Mandopop and idol dramas had seemed like the be-all-and-end-all of East Asian pop culture. Back then, Taiwanese musicians like Mayday, Jay Chou (\u5468\u6770\u502b) and S.H.E, all of whom debuted at the turn of the 21st century, ruled the airwaves. Taiwanese productions like the idol drama Meteor Garden (\u6d41\u661f\u82b1\u5712), which aired in Singapore in 2001, set new standards for popular entertainment by capturing tween and teen imaginations. But since then, Taiwan\u2019s Mandopop artistes and broadcast content have lost their sheen somewhat. Instead, K-pop has gradually eclipsed regional competitors to rise to an unprecedented level of worldwide popularity. In the last two years in particular, led by boy band BTS and girl group Blackpink, K-pop has made inroads into the American mainstream, with sold-out concert tours and appearances at music award ceremonies, Coachella and late-night talk shows. Photo: Davina Tham, Taipei Times This is a potent draw for those with big dreams, like Ashley Chang (\u5f35\u797a\u74a6), a Taipei American School student whose stage confidence belies her tender 13 years. In a typical trajectory from fan to aspirant, Chang\u2019s affection for the K-pop boy band Exo drove her to learn more about the K-pop industry and ask her parents for singing and dancing lessons. \u201cI realized that [K-pop] is more worldwide, which gives me more chance to shine brighter,\u201d Chang said. In contrast, she added, local artistes did not seem to get as much overseas exposure. YOUNG AMBITION Photo: Davina Tham, Taipei Times K-pop inspires rabid devotion through its artful engineering of performers called \u201cidols\u201d \u2014 a term that aptly evokes fan worship, but also a kind of transcendence. More than a genre, K-pop is best understood as an ecosystem of music, TV dramas, variety shows, social media interaction and advertising tie-ups that feed into each other. At the center of it all is the idol, scouted for his or her beauty, performing talents, screen presence and discipline \u2014 with that last being the most essential. Despite the appearance of glamor, life as a K-pop trainee is punishing, with all-or-nothing stakes. In South Korea, the journey can start as early as elementary school. Hopefuls who pass cutthroat auditions and receive trainee contracts with record labels must observe company rules and grueling practice schedules. They relinquish many of the freedoms of youth, like after-school hours, mobile phones and even living with their own family. And despite the sacrifices, there is no guarantee they will debut as idols. Photo courtesy of Alfa Music International \u201cThat\u2019s the power that idols give us,\u201d Tsai said when I asked why he wanted to join the K-pop industry. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to have that perseverance. They\u2019re an aspiration when it comes to learning.\u201d Eager to taste the highs and lows of trainee life, I attended one day of a K-pop singing and acting class organized by the Dr Korea K-pop Star Professional Education and Training Center (\u97d3\u570b\u5c08\u696d\u6f14\u85dd\u57f9\u8a13\u4e2d\u5fc3) in August. That was where I met Tsai, Chang and 20 other aspiring idols, aged 12 to 28. Our oldest classmate was a petite, fair-skinned nurse who moonlighted as lead vocalist of a rock band. Another was a lanky 24-year-old policeman serving in Taipei\u2019s Xinyi District (\u4fe1\u7fa9), who delivered a passionate rendition of Celine Dion\u2019s That\u2019s the Way It Is for his audition taping. Our teacher, Song In-mi, was a South Korean musical actress and teacher at Born Star Training Center (BSC) New York \u2014 the US outpost of a South Korean performing arts school established in 2008. BSC New York\u2019s Web site touts the company\u2019s memoranda of understanding with South Korean record labels and its association with several former students who have since debuted as idols. The NT$8,000 that Tsai had scraped together got him into one out of two days of the class, which cost NT$15,000 in total. Performance techniques aside, students were also paying for the possibility of a recommendation to JYP Entertainment (another of the Big Three agencies) through BSC New York, if they performed well in class. Song led us through a series of vocal and improvisation exercises, the most complex of which involved singing scales while clapping, snapping and stomping on different beats. While far from the polished routines of real K-pop idols, it previewed the ruinous outcome if I were to actually attempt dancing and singing at the same time. Fortunately, Song also valued a good attitude. She disseminated a set of rules including axioms like: \u201clife is the audition\u201d and \u201cbreak down to break through.\u201d We chanted rule number 11 (\u201cI am powerful and limitless\u201d) together to psych ourselves up for the rest of the day. Queenie Liu (\u5289\u601d\u59a4), who co-founded Dr Korea in April last year with business partner Janice Hung (\u6d2a\u5609\u7fce), told me that the company had helped three students pass auditions and become trainees in Seoul. She declined to reveal their names or agencies, citing an industry practice of keeping trainees\u2019 identities confidential until debut. Liu added that the success of Chou Tzu-yu (\u5468\u5b50\u745c), a Taiwanese member of top girl group Twice, had contributed to the rise in popularity of local K-pop training centers. Chou, who was reportedly scouted from a dance school in Tainan, made her K-pop debut in 2015. But the unpredictability of the entertainment industry is not lost on most teenagers and their parents, who try to hedge risks by making sure they remain on-track for paper qualifications and more conventional careers. Tsai\u2019s parents, though supportive of his interests, were worried about his ambitions. While he\u2019d planned to take a gap year to concentrate on auditions and K-pop lessons, they insisted that he prioritize his studies and attend college in Chiayi, studying art and design while pursuing music only on the side. As a college student, Liu, the co-founder, had made regular appearances on a local variety show. Now, she rued the lack of professional skills development for budding entertainers. She attributed K-pop\u2019s success to an purposeful alignment of education and industry in South Korea, citing how performing arts high schools and colleges maintain relationships with management agencies to recruit and nurture talent. \u201cThe entertainment industry can actually be very professionalized,\u201d Liu said, but \u201cTaiwan currently does not have any such systematic training... and Taiwanese students do not have a formal channel\u201d to pursue their ambitions. Dr Korea was her attempt to fill the gap. IN THE STUDIO One local record label explicitly adopting K-pop\u2019s training and production methods is Alfa Music International (\u963f\u723e\u767c\u97f3\u6a02), the company that produced Jay Chou\u2019s 2000 debut album. \u201cSouth Korea really does have its unique areas in music arrangement, production and dance,\u201d Alfa\u2019s vice-chairperson Daniel Chang (\u5e38\u7acb\u6b23) said. \u201cWe want to bring K-pop\u2019s training methods and spirit to Taiwan. We\u2019re not trying to imitate K-pop, but we hope to borrow from it... to improve our standards.\u201d Chang told me that one fundamental difference in K-pop was how songs were composed by groups of songwriters who specialized in specific parts, like a hook or chorus. He said this team-based, assembly-line approach lowered barriers to entry and raised the production speed of high-quality pop songs. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be a Jay Chou, like really a genius, or a JJ Lin (\u6797\u4fca\u5091),\u201d Chang said, naming two Mandopop exemplars of the singer-songwriter who composes alone. Alfa Star Academy (\u963f\u723e\u767c\u661f\u5149\u5b78\u9662) \u2014 the label\u2019s two-year-old training center \u2014 is modeled after such industry practices. Through music and dance classes in Taipei as well as experiential trips to Seoul that give students a taste of trainee life, the academy scouts for Alfa\u2019s own stable of talent. Over one week in August, about 40 middle-schoolers filled a basement of rehearsal rooms for a K-pop summer camp at Alfa\u2019s offices in Neihu District (\u5167\u6e56). I watched as the students \u2014 all girls, except for two bemused boys whose parents had registered them without their knowledge \u2014 moved in formation and popped their hips to a dance track. But not everyone is swayed by this vision of the future of pop music. \u201cMusic is not a canning factory. It\u2019s not a standardized production process,\u201d said Jian  Miao-ju (\u7c21\u5999\u5982), a National Chung Cheng University College of Communication professor and co-editor of Routledge\u2019s upcoming volume, Made in Taiwan: Studies in Popular Music. While K-pop\u2019s trainee system was a proven way to produce idols, it did not necessarily translate to other genres and cultural contexts, Chien said. In Taiwan, for example, there remained a longstanding preference for singer-songwriters. \u201cPop music reflects local society and the tastes of local audiences,\u201d she added. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as a monolithic commodity that can be compared for competitiveness at an international level.\u201d And while the heyday of Taiwan\u2019s Mandopop from the 1990s to 2000s may be over, independent rock bands like Elephant Gym (\u5927\u8c61\u9ad4\u64cd) and Sunset Rollercoaster (\u843d\u65e5\u98db\u8eca) have flown the flag overseas more recently. \u201cTaiwan\u2019s independent music has been flourishing vigorously in recent years, and the level of vitality is to the extent that even South Korean and Chinese fans are envious,\u201d Chien told me. For his part, Chang remained optimistic about the future of Mandopop, especially in Taiwan\u2019s free and creative environment. \u201cGiven our soil that\u2019s fertile for creativity, if we can bring in South Korea\u2019s strengths, I think our pop music still has a chance,\u201d he says. \u201cAt least in the Chinese-language market, we can still be in a position of leadership.\u201d Last week the New York Times published Oriana Skylar Mastro\u2019s \u201cThis is what America is getting wrong about China and Taiwan.\u201d The piece was a fairly typical example of the well-worn genre claiming that peace can be achieved by selling out Taiwan, arguing that the US should \u201ctry to understand China\u2019s deep sensitivities about Taiwan\u201d and that it \u201cshould recommit \u2014 clearly and unequivocally \u2014 to the idea that only China and Taiwan can work out their political differences.\u201d \r\n Yes, Skylar Mastro actually argues that the people with the knife at their throat should be allowed to \u201cwork out Deep inside his tribe\u2019s sacred rainforest on the Indonesian holiday island of Bali, Indigenous guide Putu Willy Suputra looks on in disbelief as a group of tourists video themselves mimicking monkeys by swinging on a long, woody vine.\r\nSuputra is a member of the 20,000-strong Adat Dalem Tamblingan Indigenous community who have lived in northern Bali since the 9th century and want rights to curb tourism and protect their rainforest and lake.\r\n\u201cThese types of things really hurt me,\u201d the 27-year-old said. \u201cThat liana will definitely die.\u201d\r\n\u201cIf we go into this forest, it is enough to walk, see, hear and leave a Tainan\u2019s Sanye Creek (\u4e09\u723a\u6eaa) isn\u2019t by any stretch of the imagination a tourist attraction. For years, it was the worst-polluted tributary of one of Taiwan\u2019s most degraded rivers. These days, however, it makes for pleasant cycling, especially if you\u2019ve an aversion to traffic and gradients.\r\nThis 14.4km-long waterway also looks and smells a good deal better than you\u2019d expect, if you were to research its postwar history. Alternatively known as Sanyegong Creek (\u4e09\u723a\u5bae\u6eaa) or Sanlaoyegong Creek (\u4e09\u8001\u723a\u5bae\u6eaa) \u2014 names which suggest there\u2019s a temple on its bank \u2014 its source is somewhere in Yongkang District (\u6c38\u5eb7). That part of Tainan is Last month, Bill Gates surprised some people by saying that planting trees isn\u2019t one of his responses to climate change. Speaking at the New York Times Climate Forward Summit on Sep. 21, the billionaire described relying on tree-planting efforts to roll back global warming as \u201ccomplete nonsense.\u201d\r\nGates is right. Even if humanity was to utilize all suitable land and plant a trillion trees \u2014 a goal endorsed by the World Economic Forum, World Wildlife Fund, Wildlife Conservation Society and other organizations \u2014 new woodlands wouldn\u2019t by themselves come close to countering global carbon dioxide emissions. \r\nThe Microsoft founder went on ",
