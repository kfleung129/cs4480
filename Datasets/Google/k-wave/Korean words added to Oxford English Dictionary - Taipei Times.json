    "text": "The Korean culture wave has swept through the editorial offices of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), which has added more than 20 new words of Korean origin to its latest edition. The \u201cdefinitive record of the English language\u201d included words alluding to the global popularity of the nation\u2019s music and cuisine, plus one or two whose roots in the Korean language might be less obvious. The K- prefix is prominently featured, as you might expect given that so many people outside of South Korea now listen to K-pop \u2014 which was added to the OED in 2016 \u2014 watch K-dramas or use K-beauty products.

Frequently as a modifier, as in hallyu craze, hallyu fan, hallyu star.\u201d However, as the dictionary\u2019s new additions make clear, there is much more to Korean cuisine than its spicy staple kimchi, which appeared in the OED as long ago as 1976. New food-related entries include bulgogi \u2014 thin slices of beef or pork \u2014 and chimaek \u2014 Korean-style fried chicken and beer. Traditional culture is represented by hanbok \u2014 formal attire worn by both Korean men and women \u2014 and Hangul, the Korean alphabet devised by King Sejong in 1443. Aegyo, a certain kind of cuteness or charm considered characteristically Korean, and similar to the Japanese word kawaii, has been included as both a noun and adjective. There is room, too, for mukbang, or livestreams of people eating extraordinary amounts of food while talking to an online audience. The inclusion of \u201cskinship\u201d is more surprising. Commonly used in South Korea, where it is rendered as seukinsip, and Japan sukinshippu) it captures the emotional bond that comes from close physical contact between a parent and child, lovers and friends, the dictionary says. The OED said the inclusion of so many Korean words was recognition of a shift in language usage beyond the English-speaking world. \u201cThe adoption and development of these Korean words in English also demonstrate how lexical innovation is no longer confined to the traditional centres of English in the United Kingdom and the United States,\u201d the OED said. \u201cThey show how Asians in different parts of the continent invent and exchange words within their own local contexts, then introduce these words to the rest of the English-speaking world, thus allowing the Korean wave to continue to ripple on the sea of English words.\u201d \u2018FIRES OF HELL\u2019:\n                                        Three bases housing US forces have been targeted by rocket and drone attacks after groups close to Iran threatened to retaliate over US support for Israel                                        The Pentagon on Saturday stepped up US military readiness in the Middle East in response to what it said were \u201crecent escalations by Iran and its proxy forces\u201d across the region.\r\nThe US has sent a significant amount of naval power to the Middle East in the past few weeks, including two aircraft carriers, their support ships and about 2,000 Marines.\r\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin ordered the activation of air defense systems and notified additional forces that they might be deployed soon.\r\nAustin did not say how many US troops would be added to those already in the region.\r\nThe Pentagon\u2019s moves Police last week arrested a man climbing on the Eiffel Tower, leading to visitors being temporarily stranded at the summit \u2014 including a reporter for The Associated Press (AP) and a Washington couple who decided during the wait to get married.\r\nAmir Khan had been planning to propose to Kat Warren later Thursday in a Paris garden away from the crowds, with a romantic dinner on the River Seine also on the menu.\r\nHowever, when the lifts were temporarily shut down because of the climber, stranding the couple and others at the top, Khan decided to spring his surprise.\r\nPat Eaton-Robb, an AP TENSE RELATIONS:\n                                        The Indian government advised its nationals not to travel to some regions in Canada, and paused processing of visa applications in the nation                                        Canada on Thursday said that it had withdrawn 41 diplomats from India \u2014 fallout from a bitter row over the killing of a Sikh separatist on Canadian soil.\r\nNew Delhi planned to revoke diplomatic immunity for all but 21 of Canada\u2019s diplomats and their families by yesterday, forcing Ottawa to pull out the others, Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Melanie Joly said.\r\n\u201cWe have facilitated their safe departure from India,\u201d Joly said. \u201cThis means that our diplomats and their families have now left.\u201d\r\nRelations between India and Canada have plunged since Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last month publicly linked Indian intelligence to DRUG WAR:\n                                        At least 12 police officers were killed in three separate attacks, as cartel-related violence escalates in the run-up to national elections next year                                        Three separate armed attacks in Mexico on Monday left at least 24 people dead, including a dozen police officers, authorities said about the latest violence to hit regions plagued by drug trafficking.\r\nIn the deadliest incident, unidentified attackers targeted a security patrol in Guerrero state\u2019s municipality of Coyuca de Benitez, prosecutor Alejandro Hernandez said.\r\nAt least 13 people were killed and two others wounded in that attack, the state prosecutor\u2019s office said in a statement, with Hernandez earlier haviang confirmed that at least 11 of those killed were members of the municipal police force. \r\nA senior state security official was traveling in ",
