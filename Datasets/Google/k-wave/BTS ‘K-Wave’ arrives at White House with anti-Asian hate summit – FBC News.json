They are the world\u2019s best-selling artists, and they have brought the \u201cK-Wave\u201d to the White House. But BTS were not there to show President Joe Biden their \u201cdynamite\u201d moves. Rather, it was to discuss anti-Asian hate. Crimes targeting East Asians have risen dramatically in the US amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The boy band members \u2013 all in their 20s \u2013 vowed to help Mr Biden, 79, tackle the issue. \u201cIt\u2019s not wrong to be different,\u201d BTS member Suga said through an interpreter. \u201cMaybe equality begins when we open up and embrace all of our differences\u201d. Another member, V, said that \u201ceveryone has their own history\u201d. \u201cWe hope today is one step forward to respecting and understanding each and every one as a valuable person,\u201d he added. Dressed in matching black suits, the seven members group did not take questions from reporters before leaving the White House briefing room to head to their meeting with President Biden. The group have been outspoken about their experiences with anti-Asian hate. Following a series of massage parlours shootings targeting Asian women in Georgia last year, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V and Jungkook spoke out about their own experiences with anti-Asian discrimination. They\u2019ve \u201cendured expletives without reason\u201d and have been mocked for their appearance, they said. \u201cWe cannot put into words the pain of becoming the subject of hatred and violence for such a reason\u201d. In February, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry \u2013 a music industry body \u2013 announced that the group beat the likes of Taylor Swift, Drake and Adele to become the world\u2019s best-selling artists for a second year running. \u201cWe still feel surprised that music created by South Korean artists reaches so many people around the world, transcending languages and cultural barriers,\u201d Jungkook said at the White House. He added that the group believes that \u201cmusic is always an amazing and wonderful unifier of all things\u201d. ",
