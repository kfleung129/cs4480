    "text": "This is sad, as Cantonese song lyrics are one of the treasures of the musical culture of Hong Kong. I do appreciate the lyrics written by our renowned composers, such as Wyman Wong and Lin Xi. They are agents of socialisation who transmit their values and views on daily issues. One can learn from their life experiences through the lyrics, which are able to inspire and touch others. More importantly, they resonate with and arouse sympathy from listeners.
