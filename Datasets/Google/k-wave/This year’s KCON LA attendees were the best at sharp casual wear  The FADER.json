    "text": "As described on KCON USA\u2019s site, the gigantic celebration of Korean pop culture is \u201cthe original convention dedicated to bring \u2018All Things Hallyu\u2019 to the American fan base.\u201d Since 2012, the event has been doing just that, bringing \u201cHallyu\u201d (a Korean phrase meaning \u2018Korean Wave,\u2019 that is a sort-of umbrella terminology for the global rise in popularity of Korean pop music, food, TV and movies, fashion and more) into a tangible, multi-faceted experience for fans in the US and around the world. This past weekend, KCON took over LA\u2019s Staples Center. On Sunday, the convention\u2019s final day, the schedule of events featured panels and workshops, like a deep dive into the girl groups changing the current K-pop landscape, and ended with a concert curated by M Countdown, a weekly South Korean K-Pop countdown show featuring right-now\u2019s most popular acts. Casual wear for an all day fest seems simple enough:\u00a0a clean tee, great-fitting bottoms, and some nice ass sneakers. Everyone in attendance on Sunday was dressed in the sharpest iteration of that clothing combination. Most opted for toned-down colors and well-cut pieces in the form of matching sets or layered tops paired with denim. To spice things up, looks were often accented by vibrantly dyed hair or super-cute accent accessories like a button featuring a photo of a favorite artist, a phone case in the shape of a beloved cartoon character, or a multi-colored keychain. And as we've seen over the course of this summer, mesh tights were, yet again, all the rage. Peep our favorite looks from the event below. ",
