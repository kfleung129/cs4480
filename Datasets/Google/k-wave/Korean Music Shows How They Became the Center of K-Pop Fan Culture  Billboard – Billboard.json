From boy bands to hip-hop to rock, the origin of K-pop\u2019s sound is thoroughly American. But it\u2019s also likely that American TV largely influenced the multi-medium\u2019s emphasis on visuals, whereby dance, fashion and \u201cconcepts\u201d are inextricably tied to the definition of K-pop.

(Notably, one of the Boys, Yang Hyun-suk, later founded YG Entertainment, the Big 3 company that jump-started the careers of chart-topping K-pop acts like Psy, BIGBANG and 2NE1.)   \u201cIt\u2019s played a very significant role of visualizing K-pop through \u2026 fashion statements [and] good looks, and it really played a role of a mother to give birth to this visual culture before YouTube became the main language,\u201d Kim continues. \u201cMusic videos were first disseminated over the top of the chart TV shows, because some of the shows had segments featuring [new] music videos, and I think it really visualized the music.\u201d But Korean music television diverged from MTV later in the decade, as the music video request format of Total Request Live gained prominence in America and Gayo Top 10, the country\u2019s longtime preeminent music chart show, was cancelled. \u201c[Gayo] actually predates TRL as it first aired in 1981 and would have the top 10 songs of the week,\u201d says Paul Han, co-owner of the English-language K-pop blog allkpop. \u201cThe show ended in 1998 and was replaced by the more familiar Music Bank for current K-pop fans.\u201d Coincidentally, Music Bank and Inkigayo, the first manifestations of modern Korean music show culture \u2014 in which several such countdown shows, with differing chart methodologies, air exhaustively throughout the week \u2014 both started around the same time as TRL.  Today, there are six main music shows in Korea \u2014 SBS\u2019s Inkigayo, MBC\u2019s Show! Music Core, KBS\u2019s Music Bank, Mnet\u2019s M! Countdown, MBC Music\u2019s Show Champion and SBS MTV\u2019s The Show \u2014 each designated for one day of the week, from Tuesday to Sunday. Korean music shows largely focus on \u201clive\u201d performances (at least half of them are pre-recorded) instead of music videos \u2014 closer to the model of TRL\u2019s 2017 reboot \u2014 with some small interview segments sandwiched between different acts. K-pop acts dominate these shows, where they promote their latest singles for varying lengths of time \u2014 an established group like Shinee might promote each single for two weeks, while a younger group like Pristin\u00a0might release three singles a year, promoting them every day for about a month each. The constant exposure offered by these music shows is the bread and butter of many acts\u2019 marketing in an oversaturated field. The shows are integral to creating the ubiquity necessary for fans to be completely immersed in the music. And that level of immersion is the reason why K-pop fans are as devoted as they are.   The demanding schedule of these shows does take its toll. Promotion days require hours upon hours of prepping, rehearsals and shooting \u2014 and it\u2019s not like idols (K-pop speak for \u201cstars\u201d) can skip a day. \u201cThey really have to show up in every single cable and terrestrial channel for the sake of not getting any disadvantage,\u201d says Dr. Kim. \u201cIf you show up at MBC and SBS and not show up at KBS, [you might] build a bad relationship with one particular broadcasting system.\u201d But the shows do have their perks. Winners receive a trophy in front of their peers, then perform an encore of their winning song. Every show is different, in that they all have their own rules for calculating winners, so the music show scene doesn\u2019t feel static. The majority of the shows place the most emphasis in the breakdown of their total scores\u00a0on digital sales. Inkigayo counts YouTube views as 35 percent of its score, while Show! Music Core pre-selects a committee of 200 people on their homepage to determine 10 percent of artists\u2019 total scores. The sheer diversity of these algorithms makes the simplicity of TRL\u2019s pre-revival voting system \u2014 which allowed fans to vote on their favorite clips by email and phone \u2014 seem almost frivolous by comparison. Korean music show awards tap into the gratification factor for fans who vote daily. The presence of a physical trophy and encore stage adds a viscerally satisfying element to fan and idol efforts to land the No. 1 spot on the music show charts. \u201cOn TRL they didn\u2019t have all the artists gather and then award a trophy at the end to the winner,\u201d says Han. \u201cIt\u2019s just much more satisfactory to receive a big trophy with all of your peers around. In a way, it\u2019s sort of like a mini-music award show every week, and only one can be the winner.\u201d  But Dr. Kim is more skeptical of music show wins. She says that there\u2019s a possibility of the system of chart wins being rigged. The recommended lists on digital music sites could be one of the culprits. \u201cSo, for example, [let\u2019s say] I am the owner of [South Korean music download site] MelOn Music Charts, and I found you as an idol and you haven\u2019t even debuted yet,\u201d Dr. Kim offers. \u201cSo, I decide to invest in your career, invest for your album. So the terms of your contract would be, when your album is released, it\u2019s going to be primarily put on my online music site for a certain period of time.\u201d The idea is that music on recommended lists is more likely to sell, and those increased sale scores place select idol groups closer to victory. \u201cSo, winning the top of the charts doesn\u2019t really mean that much,\u201d says Dr. Kim. \u201cThe way I read it is, perhaps the song had the heaviest investment from these big shoulders.\u201d  Don\u2019t tell that to BTS\u2019s fandom, called ARMY, though. One of the biggest stories in BTS\u2019 mythology as self-made former underdogs is that their first-ever win for \u201cI Need U\u201d at \u201cThe Show\u201d in May 2015 was the major turning point in their career, propelling them to success. \u201cBefore that, their album sales were good but didn\u2019t rival the top groups,\u201d says Han. \u201cAfter the [2015] release of The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 1 and their first music show win, you started to feel the BTS momentum building up.\u201d It\u2019s a well-documented fact that the members of BTS were long plotting how to reach the top on Korean music shows. \u201cDo you think we can reach No. 1?\u201d the K-pop phenom\u2019s leader, Rap Monster, asks his members during \u201cSkit: Expectation!\u201d on The Most Beautiful Moment in Life Pt. 1. Suga responds, \u201cWell, not getting caught up on being No. 1 or whatever. I really like the album itself. The album is good. I like the songs.\u201d Then Rap Monster utters his mission statement: \u201cI can\u2019t be satisfied by the album now. We have to get No. 1.\u201d So, when they won almost two years after their June 2013 debut, it was a big deal for the fans and members of BTS. \u201cWhen artists win on these music shows, it\u2019s very much a milestone for the artists,\u201d says Robin Jun, senior content editor at Soompi. \u201cAn artist\u2019s first music show win is something that they definitely remember. And the fans remember it too.\u201d Recently, international ARMYs, including the fandom\u2019s American arm, mobilized to help BTS score the highest-charting hit for a K-pop group in Hot 100 history, with current single \u201cDNA\u201d (now at a peak of No. 67, on the chart dated Oct. 14) \u2014 organizing through social media posts breaking down each music chart\u2019s formula. This brand of highly coordinated fan efforts might have been new territory for Western fandom, but it\u2019s the norm for K-pop fans who watch music shows. \u201cFans have passion and they want their idols to win,\u201d says Han over email. \u201cAlbum sales, digital sales, streaming all help in the point system of Korean music shows so that only drives consumerism even further. You see some fans doing bulk-buying \u2014 buying hundreds of albums \u2014 just so it will help their idols secure a win.\u201d   \u201cTeenage groups in Korea tend to be very\u2026 tech-savvy, so I think they had their fair amount of training through these music chart shows in Korea,\u201d says Dr. Kim. \u201cIn that sense, I think this fan culture could be somewhat contagious. Korean fans have cultivated a certain kind of fandom and fan culture, and I guess foreign fans are, to a certain extent, emulating that.\u201d By contrast, TRL, which was absent for the bulk of the social media revolution, has an uphill battle ahead of it in establishing its place in a multimedia world that has edged out TV sets. One way MTV is grappling with the exceedingly digitized music landscape on the 2017 resurrection of the program is by hiring legit YouTube pros \u2014 Gigi Gorgeous, Gabbie Hanna and Eva Gutowski \u2014 as social media correspondents. But this pivot to social media comes at the expense of the show\u2019s video countdown, which was removed from the show\u2019s reboot, and a good deal of its accompanying musical identity. For their part, rather than compete with social media, Korean music shows have maintained their focus on the music by incorporating YouTube views into the algorithm for artists\u2019 total scores, while capitalizing on the online video giant\u2019s potential for international circulation. Music shows\u2019 embrace of social media has played a large role in the way fans rally around their faves. \u201cIt\u2019s now become a sort of competition between fandoms because there has started to be this movement of just breaking records,\u201d says Jun. \u201cLike, who can [get] to, say, 10 million views the fastest? Or who can get the most views in 24 hours? And that was kind of started when they added the YouTube component to music show charts.\u201d Korean music shows\u2019 activity on YouTube is tied to K-pop\u2019s growing globalization, known as the Hallyu wave. Given the amount of resources it takes to produce one performance on a music show (Soompi estimates outfits alone often add up to $2,500-$4,200 for just one show), it would be wasteful for idols\u2019 performances to be \u201cone-time, disposable consumption item[s],\u201d as Dr. Kim puts it. \u201cYouTube is how you circulate yourself internationally,\u201d she says. \u201cEspecially since 2011, music chart shows have had their eye on putting their content on YouTube for global circulation.\u201d  Beyond YouTube, Korean music shows also reach overseas fans through more direct means. \u201cThey\u2019re not only creating music shows shown in Korea with a creative consideration for international participation,\u201d says Dr. Kim, \u201cbut they\u2019re actually bringing those music chart shows overseas and creating a live concert out of them.\u201d Music Bank has gone on world tours almost every year since 2011, organizing concerts with multiple K-pop acts in cities like Paris and Mexico City. KCON (Korean wave convention) is an even bigger venture that spans multiple cities each year, regularly stopping in Los Angeles. Organized in part by M! Countdown, the lineups are treated like a music festival while the convention seeks to showcase \u201cevery element of Hallyu encompassing pop music, TV dramas, movies, fashion, food, and beauty.\u201d Amid Korean music shows\u2019 contribution to the globalization of K-pop, idols\u2019 faces increasingly appear on billboards in New York\u2019s Times Square, a domain once dominated by TRL. Fans purchase advertising spots to celebrate important dates for their idols. In August, ARMYs celebrated youngest BTS member Jungkook\u2019s 21st birthday on several panels, while NCT\u2019s Taeyong was in NYC when his own face was projected on his birthday in July. #?? ?? ????? ???? ????\u2013 ?? ?????\u2013 #NCT127 #TAEYONG A post shared by NCT 127 Official Instagram (@nct127) on Jun 30, 2017 at 12:29am PDT  Now that BTS has made a significant breakthrough in the American market, time will tell how the return of TRL will further complicate notions of cultural exchange between America and Korea. After all, TRL\u2019s official Twitter account recently tweeted that the show \u2014 which has a long history of uplifting American boy bands like *NSYNC \u2014 is \u201cwatching\u201d the K-pop seven-piece. Soon enough, the rest of the country may be too. now watching @BTS_twt all night https://t.co/GObNBeKo2H \u2014 TRL (@TRL) September 30, 2017  Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.
