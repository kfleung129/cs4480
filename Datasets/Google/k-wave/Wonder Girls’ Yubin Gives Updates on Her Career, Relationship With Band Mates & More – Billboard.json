Check out what she had to say about a potential solo career, her relationship with her fellow Wonder Girls and more below in this\u00a0exclusive Q&A.  How did you and Justin connect for \u201cThe Heartbroken\u201d remix? I met Justin in L.A.\u00a0back in 2012, 2011 when I was shooting my movie. I met Justin at a Korean restaurant through a friend and I had dinner with\u00a0him. We talked about K-pop, music and\u00a0we got close; especially on Twitter because [Wonder Girls] were in New York and he was in L.A., so we didn\u2019t really get to see each other. Numerous times, he said he wanted to work with me and he offered if I could feature on his track. I was so thankful and I was honored that I was part of the project. What was it like rapping in English again? It\u2019s been like two years since I\u2019ve rapped in English, but I listen to a lot of hip-hop and R&B in English and I follow the trends, so it wasn\u2019t too difficult. I did have a hard time in the beginning, but it was fine.The remix got a huge reaction when fans heard you, going to No. 1 on the real-time Twitter charts. Did you anticipate such a big response? It was really nice to see the reaction from the fans, how I came back and featured on Justin\u2019s track. I wasn\u2019t expecting a huge reaction, but I had a lot of fun working with him and in the future if there\u2019s another chance to work with Justin, I\u2019m more than glad to work with him. That leads into my next question, does this remix mark an upcoming solo career for you? Will you keep recording collaborations? So, I\u2019m happy that I had the opportunity to work with Justin and if I have a chance to do a solo career, yeah, I\u2019m more than happy to do it. I\u2019m always working and developing whatever skills I have. Yes, I\u2019m up for doing any collaborations that I can and I\u2019m happy that I can\u00a0spread my\u00a0talent\u00a0and my music to my fans, and be able to share with them. Yeah, if there\u2019s an opportunity, yeah, I\u2019m more than happy to be doing it.  I loved that song you did with\u00a0Ivy in 2012, \u201cI Dance.\u201d Oh thanks,\u00a0I love that song too. You really are one of the leaders of K-pop\u2019s international expansion. Today, there\u2019s more albums on the charts and more concerts here than ever. How do you feel seeing how far it\u2019s come now? I\u2019m really glad that I\u2019m one of the artists that spread the K-pop and hallyu [the\u00a0Korean wave]\u00a0all around the world. I hope to spread that in the future as well and I\u2019m happy that I was a part of that. It\u2019s surprising how K-pop got big and I wish that it goes on, and in the future I want to be a part of it as well. Wonder Girls Cover B.o.B / Bruno Mars: The Poll Winner! As someone who\u2019s been in the scene\u00a0awhile. What acts get you excited today? Who gets the Yubin stamp of approval? [Laughs.] Right now\u00a0I\u2019m into this guy HyukOh\u00a0because I like the band sound but of course, I root for GOT7, and Jimin and Yerin from 15&. I\u2019m rooting for all the artists from\u00a0JYP like GOT7, Jimin and Yerin, and then I also like\u00a0HyukOh.Speaking of your JYP label mates, have you spoke with your Wonder Girl band mates? Do you guys all keep in touch still? Actually, we are living together. Oh really? Yenny, Lim and\u00a0Sunmi \u2014\u00a0we are living together, so I actually saw them like 10 minutes ago [Laughs.]\u00a0I see them everyday.\u00a0Sohee, she visits the apartment a lot. She actually came over three days ago and I see her often as well. Also,\u00a0Sun, we talk all the time through the phone because she\u2019s not in Korea. But we all stay in touch. That\u2019s great to hear and, even though you\u2019re all young, you\u2019re\u00a026,\u00a0you really have a ton of\u00a0wisdom.\u00a0Do you have advice to have for someone who\u2019s considering entering\u00a0the K-pop world? As\u00a0someone who didn\u2019t make it through a lot of auditions, I had a lot of tryouts\u00a0and after all those tryouts, I made it to the Wonder Girls. It\u2019s important to know your goals and what you dream for and what you want to follow. But at the same time, don\u2019t be too depressed if you don\u2019t make it. You just have to keep trying if you really want something.\u00a0\u00a0You need to know what your limit is and try to develop from there. I wasn\u2019t down because I didn\u2019t make it into a certain company;\u00a0I\u2019m glad I made it to the Wonder Girls and now I\u2019m here. No one should be depressed if you they don\u2019t make it. If they really want it, they should keep trying.  Anything add? I haven\u2019t really been too active these days, but I\u2019m glad I got to interact with my fans and was\u00a0able to work with a great artist, Justin;\u00a0a great artist and a friend. I\u2019m really happy I got the chance to work with him through this opportunity. I\u2019m going to try to meet my fans as soon as possible, very soon, so keep\u00a0your eyes out.
