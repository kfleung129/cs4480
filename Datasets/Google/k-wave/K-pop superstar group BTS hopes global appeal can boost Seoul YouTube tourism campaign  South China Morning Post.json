The seven-member boy band \u2013 now on a world tour \u2013 filmed seven tourism commercials for release on the media platforms, with the first shown on Monday morning on Seoul\u2019s official YouTube channel. The films, produced in collaboration with the local government, are also being broadcast on television channels \u2013\u2015 KBS World aired in 58 million households in 117 countries and tvN Asia Channel, which is available to 9 million households in nine Southeast Asian countries. The members of BTS, as honorary ambassadors for Seoul for the second successive year, have filmed commercials and a music video. The music video titled With Seoul mesmerised fans to the extent that Seoul\u2019s official tourism website crashed. Last month the band claimed the No 1 spot on the Billboard 200 Albums chart with \u201cLove Yourself: Answer\u201d. The promotional videos feature seven themes: Delicious Seoul, Relaxing Seoul, Extreme Seoul, Historic Seoul, K-Wave Seoul, Fashionable Seoul and Exclusive Seoul. \u201cDelicious Seoul\u201d portrays Jungkook strolling through Dokkaebi Night Market where there are scores of popular food trucks, and the group introduces different dishes that will tingle one\u2019s taste buds. \u201cRelaxing Seoul\u201d is introduced by Ji-min, who visits Seoul's city wall and highlights people relaxing while kayaking on the Han River, which runs through the capital. \u201cExtreme Seoul\u201d, promoted by RM, introduces extreme sports and festivals where members are shown rock climbing on Mount Bukhan and being sprayed with water during the Waterbomb Festival, as well soaking up the atmosphere of the street-cheering culture that Seoul has to offer during major sporting events. In \u201cHistoric Seoul\u201d, Jin gives a glimpse of the country\u2019s culture and history by portraying traditional martial arts and showing how to make traditional pottery at Namsan Beacon Fire Station.
