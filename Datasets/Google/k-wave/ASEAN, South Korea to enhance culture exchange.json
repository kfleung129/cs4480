    "text": "The Korean Wave has gotten the pulse of its audience in ASEAN countries, and officials and experts are saying they hope the ASEAN and Korea can go beyond the one-way wave and bring a two-way wave through more culture exchanges in the future. SEOUL \u2014 South Korea\u2019s popularity is on the rise, not just in ASEAN countries, but around the globe. K-pop songs top the charts not only in Asia but also in America and the United Kingdom, making BTS the first Korean band to ever have a UK number one. But it\u2019s not just music that\u2019s helping improve South Korea. \u201cThe Korean Wave\u201d refers to the global popularity of South Korea's cultural economy exporting pop\u00a0culture, entertainment, music, TV dramas and movies. The phenomenon is consumed all over the world. ASEAN region, in particular, is one of the largest consumption markets South Korean dramas and K-pop (South Korean pop music). The export of South Korean music and broadcast content to ASEAN had totalled USS$86 million in 2016. ASEAN countries also are the second largest in term of number of fan page and fan club members for K-pop stars. \u201cMost scholars and critics have explained in terms of economic benefits and the growth in soft power on global diplomacy. I think it\u2019s time for us to discuss the transnational community,\u201d said Jang Won-ho, director of the Center for Glocal Culture and Social Empathy, who is also the Dean of the College of Urban Sciences, University of Seoul, at the ASEAN-Korea Media Forum in Seoul yesterday. Jang has researched the phenomenon, also called Hallyu, and he said he saw positive signs. He cited the case of BTS, the most popular K-pop band in the region.\u00a0Since BTS has a large number of fans and see themselves as role model, the band has been working with the UNICEF to raise funds for the \u201cLove Myself\u201d Campaign. \u201cI see the good influence on fandoms that the band has,\u201d he said. Jang also shared a picture of two Palestinians girls and a Jewish girl, who are BTS\u2019s fans, saying he saw the possibility for strong empathy among young people who share the same interests. \u201cI think this is the strong possibility for the solidarity between different groups of people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be the future of Hallyu.\u201d Lee Hyuk, secretary general off the ASEAN-Korea Center, said the Korean Wave has become a crucial pillar for the strong relationship between the two regions. He added that promoting socio-cultural exchanges between ASEAN and South Korea will be fostered in the future. \u201cBetter understanding of each other\u2019s culture will help us to appreciate and respect each other. We should continue our efforts in fostering a better environment to expand relationships through lively social, cultural and people-to-people exchange,\u201d he said. Ko Jeong Min, a professor at the Hongik University, Seoul, agreed. \u201cIt is important that ASEAN-Korea cultural exchange is not one-side,\u201d he said. \u201c(South) Korea is now exporting its culture to ASEAN but I believe culture exchange between the two sides can be improved. ASEAN knows a lot about Korean culture but we don\u2019t know anything about ASEAN idols. If we know, we can enjoy the benefits from ASEAN countries,\u201d he said. He also emphasised on the need to utilise the residence programme in South Korea to support the stay of ASEAN personnel in South Korea and support their activities. Ko also proposed the co-production by ASEAN and South Korea in terms of performances, films and dramas. Not just K-pop Cod Satrusayang, managing editor of the Asia News Network, agreed that cultural exchanges were necessary in order to ensure empathy, understanding and building a closer regional bond, but said cultural exchanges should not only be about the Korean Waves. \u201cI\u2019m impressed by how much K-pop fills Korea and how TV infiltrated\u00a0various cultures in ASEAN nations and I think that\u2019s only a good thing. But popular culture, the arts, and entertainment music \u2013 that\u2019s only a fraction of culture,\u201d Cod said. \u201cCulture is also ideas, culture is also heritage with which you inherited from the people.\u00a0 I think within South Korean culture, beyond K-pop, beyond the next Korean drama, there are important ideas within South Korea that ASEAN would be happy to learn from,\u201d he said. K-pop is important, but there\u2019s also an intellectual cachet\u00a0that can be had by exchanging intellectual ideas as well, Cod said.\u2014VNS The event, organised by American Motion Picture Association (MPA), AnSinh Group and IPCom Vi\u1ec7t Nam, aimed to raise awareness of\u00a0the importance of protecting IP in the context Vi\u1ec7t Nam has joined the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), as well as amid the rapid growth of\u00a0digital technology, software, arts and entertainment. The floor of the bridge is made of 5cm thick bulletproof glass and\u00a0can serve from 50 to 70 visitors at a time.
