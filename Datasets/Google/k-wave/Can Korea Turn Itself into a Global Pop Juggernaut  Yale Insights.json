    "text": "Two decades ago, with the aim of diversifying its economy, Korea set its sights on supplying pop culture to the world. What does the country\u2019s top-down effort to build a creative economy say about what it takes to succeed on the global stage? By Ted O\u2019Callahan The most watched video ever on YouTube has received more than 2.5 billion views, a testament to the massive reach of the online platform. This top video has a billion-click lead on Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cBlank Space\u201d and is a solid 1.3 billion views ahead of anything by Justin Bieber. You\u2019ve most likely heard this song about a ritzy district in Seoul, South Korea, and can call to mind the image of a slightly portly man in a blue tuxedo jacket gyrating to a dance beat. It\u2019s, of course, \u201cGangnam Style,\u201d by Psy. The music video\u2019s success is a symbol of both the growing global reach of South Korean pop culture and the potential of the global entertainment system to spread ideas. Embedded in the song\u2019s name is a reference to a Seoul neighborhood, and the penumbra of association and reputation that go with it. Before the video, few outside of South Korea would have understood that reference. Today, millions can tell you that Gangnam is a district in Seoul, while mimicking Psy\u2019s goofy dance moves. While Psy\u2019s reach is arguably sui generis, the development of Korea\u2019s creative economy is the result of very intentional government policy\u2014policy enacted through close collaboration between the public and private sectors\u2014and an extension of the economic approach that drove the country\u2019s rapid rise from poverty. Korea was occupied by Japan for the first half of the 20th century, then devastated by the war that divided the peninsula. In 1961, South Korea\u2019s GDP, at $91 per capita, was less than that of Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and much of Sub-Saharan Africa. By 2013, it had risen to $26,000, which put South Korea on par with Saudi Arabia, Portugal, and Spain, according to World Bank figures. A country with limited natural resources on a land mass smaller than Kentucky managed this transformation through rapid, government-led, export-oriented industrialization. \u201cSouth Korea is the only capitalist liberal democracy that can behave, when necessary, as a command economy,\u201d says Euny Hong YC \u201995, author of The Birth of Korean Cool: How One Nation Is Conquering the World Through Pop Culture. She describes a \u201cvoluntary coercion\u201d that can seem like South Korea\u2019s government is a board of directors overseeing 50 million employees. \u201cIn Korea everything is linked, so a change in economic strategy means a change in society and a change in politics.\u201d The government\u2019s industrialization strategy was carried out by chaebols\u2014family-controlled businesses. In the process, those chaebols became multinational conglomerates; Samsung, Hyundai, and LG are among the best known in the West. The size of the chaebols has grown to the point where the top 10 accounted for 76% of the country\u2019s GDP in 2011. The economy\u2019s dependence on such a small number of firms has long been a concern. Efforts to diversify go back to the 1990s, beginning with a whitepaper from a presidential advisory board on science and technology, which noted that a single movie, Jurassic Park, earned the equivalent of selling 1.5 million Hyundai cars. The paper sparked a national discussion about getting into the pop culture business. The result was the formation, in 1994, of the Cultural Industry Bureau. Despite the bureaucratic name, it was an audacious step because, as Hong says, \u201cThere was zero market for Korean popular culture. It had to be force fed into foreign markets.\u201d The government paid to translate Korean soap operas and even arranged for ad sales so that TV stations across Asia would accept the ready-to-play packages. It worked. After succeeding in Asian countries, the process was repeated in Latin America. Even niche audiences got attention. Soap operas sent to Paraguay included both Spanish and Guarani-language versions. \u201cFor a time, many people thought globalization was code for Americanization,\u201d Hong says. \u201cIn parts of the world, there is a generation of children growing up who have more familiarity with Korean TV than American TV. Those influences have impact.\u201d She acknowledges that the U.S. is still the dominant player: it has about 35% of the global media and entertainment market share while Korea has 3%, according to the PwC Global Entertainment and Media Outlook. Yet, Hong believes that a potentially tectonic shift could be underway. Korea has, in many cases, targeted poor countries that aren\u2019t currently important markets for consumer goods. It is a strategy that may take time to fully pay off but, as those countries develop, Korean brands will be the ones linked to aspirational lifestyles. Part of the appeal may come from offering something very different. Though Korean movies often contain violence and sex, Korean television dramas are produced to be family-friendly\u2014the country\u2019s child-protection laws are extremely strict. As a result, Korean shows have benefitted from what what Hong describes as the \u201cTwilight Effect.\u201d \u201cThere is a market for the chaste, old-fashioned courtship, where nobody has sex,\u201d she says. In fact, Korean dramas have strong followings in a number of strict Muslim societies. Judging the success of the overall strategy is difficult. Total output of Korean creative content industries has expanded quickly, but even so in 2014 it accounted for just $5.4 billion in Korea\u2019s $1.4 trillion economy (in the U.S., by comparison, entertainment industries account for $600 billion within a $17.4 trillion economy). \u201cWhile the creative content industry is a small part of the Korean economy, its impact on the overall economy is significant,\u201d says Dal Yong Jin, a professor of media studies at Simon Fraser University. \u201cThe spillover effects are not small at all.\u201d The music, film, TV, video games, and even food and fashion industries are maturing, Dal notes: \u201cThe Korean Wave is unique because the country has developed several cultural industries at the same time.\u201d Dal also points to the marketing benefits of the strategy. \u201cThe government plans to enhance the national image and national brands in tandem with the Korean Wave,\u201d he says. Korea\u2019s entertainment push is closely tied to a technological foundation. As Dal puts it, \u201cThe new Korean Wave relies on both popular culture and digital culture.\u201d Social media, streaming, and mobile platforms are critical in reaching audiences. Online games allow producers to reach a global audience while bypassing the game console wars. And a more recent push into mobile gaming is also an opportunity for Samsung\u2019s phones, which have long been used for the social networks that spread and stream K-pop music videos. Korean pop music is a new package built using an old model. As in the old Hollywood studio system, artists are signed to years-long, ironclad contracts. Talent is controlled and packaged by studios. K-pop artists are typically signed very young and, after years of training, emerge as stars with names and personae created out of whole cloth by the studio. And the music? \u201cThere\u2019s nothing very Korean about K-pop,\u201d says Hong. \u201cA typical K-pop song will have a melody bought from Sweden, the lyrics will be written in house, and the dance choreographers are usually American.\u201d She explains that the head of one of the largest studios told her the key to K-pop is the visuals. \u201cThe reason K-pop videos are so mesmerizing is that everyone is moving in this almost super-human synchronicity,\u201d Hong says\u2014the result of seven or eight years of practicing together before performing in public. The control of the stars and vertical integration of the studios allow for slick packages that include albums, music videos, tours, video games, movies, and stage shows. This is where Psy\u2019s success is unexpected. K-pop stars are generally shiny characters created by the studios. Psy doesn\u2019t fit the mold. \u201cHe was born with the wrong look,\u201d Hong says. \u201cHe was born with the wrong body shape. He has the wrong face. He dresses himself. He writes his own song\u2014in Korea that\u2019s extremely rare\u2014and he doesn\u2019t write about the K-pop themes.\u201d Psy is controversial, but popular, in Korea. \u201cThis is a paradoxical example of winning the K-pop game by doing it the American way,\u201d Hong notes. \u201cHe is literally the only one.\u201d So when Psy became the global face of Korean pop culture, he also became a symbol of innovation at home. But, Hong says, Koreans are very good at making decisions based on data. While Psy violates many of Korea\u2019s norms, the data point offered by his YouTube dominance is compelling. Thus the man whose greatest fame comes from mocking the aspirations and affectations of Gangnam\u2014the Beverly Hills of Seoul\u2014is now being held up as a model to follow.
