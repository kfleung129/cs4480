No matter where Marvin Konopasek goes, someone recognizes him. And on the Fourth of July later this week, Konopasek will get the chance to wave at all of those who know him as this year\u2019s grand marshal of the annual Norfolk Odd Fellow Lodge parade. \u201cI love the thought of it,\u201d he said. \u201cI was very surprised.\u201d As a longtime Norfolk resident, Konopasek has been part of some well-known businesses in the city. Konopasek started in business in 1956 with a small eating shop in downtown Norfolk. He moved the eatery to Pasewalk Avenue in 1958 and then built the Double K restaurant in 1964, said his wife, Arla. \u201cNo matter where we go, someone will say they miss the onion rings or the cole slaw,\u201d Mrs. Konopasek said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we go somewhere where we don\u2019t have a response.\u201d The large chicken affixed to the Double K\u2019s roof was practically a landmark, she said. The chicken is now located in the Elkhorn Valley Museum and Research Center in Norfolk. \u201cA lot of people will tell us when they would give directions, they\u2019d say, \u2018When you come over the viaduct, you\u2019ll see the chicken on the roof,\u2019 and they gave directions from there,\u201d she said. Konopasek also purchased King\u2019s Ballroom in 1972, which he operated until it burned in 1986. On top of that, he catered for a lot of events in Northeast Nebraska. \u201cA lot of people know him through that,\u201d Mrs. Konopasek said. \u201cNo matter where we go, someone says, \u2018Hi, Marv.\u2019 \u201d In 2004, Konopasek closed the Double K\u2019s doors and has enjoyed retirement ever since. \u201cEverybody said I was going to miss the restaurant and the ballroom. I don\u2019t really miss anything, but I miss the people, talking to them,\u201d he said. \u201cI love my retirement.\u201d Registration for the annual holiday parade will start at 8 a.m. on Thursday, July 4, with the parade starting at 10 a.m. The parade route will be different than previous years.
