The recent Texas A&M grad, who has posted sponsored content with e.l.f. Cosmetics, says she\u2019s interested in partnering with brands that \u201cI have bought or wore before any of this all happened. I want to genuinely like the product.\u201d\u00a0As for TikTokers becoming the next fashion icons, she says, \u201cIt\u2019s already happening with E-girls and E-boys and everybody wearing chains and the long-sleeved shirts. It\u2019s already happening where people like Tana Mongeau and Billie Eilish are inspiring young girls and boys everywhere to not be so preoccupied with how you look.\u201d In fact, internet-based E-girl and E-boy styles were some of the top Google searches of 2019 for \u201cFashion Style\u201d and \u201cOutfit Ideas.\u201d Me trying Kombucha for the first time #foryoupage #foryou #fyp #AllBrandNew original sound \u2013 brittanyt445  According to CAA digital media agent Lydia Fotiadou, labels like Celine and Calvin Klein have \u201crealized the importance\u201d of the app and \u201cTikTok creators are a growing area of interest\u201d for the agency. Jill McDermott, co-founder of Michele Marie PR, adds that \u201cTikTok influencers will be a huge focus\u201d for the fashion publicity company in 2020. While she says Instagram is a place to court millennials, TikTok is an opportunity \u201cto target Gen Z as well. This is the platform they love. Their followers are engaged and devoted, and conversion is expected to be high.\u201d Marlee Martinez, founder of lifestyle, marketing and public relations company Valleymade & Co., adds that \u201cTikTok stars have the \u2018It\u2019 factor at the moment. They connect with their young audience with humor, creativity and fashion statements. \u2026 These stars are appealing for brand placements as they use innovative storytelling to a large audience, which sells.\u201d  Spring, a fashion brand development and PR agency, recently scored its first TikTok placement after it sent fashion influencer Chriselle Lim a bag from Sydney-based brand Aje, and Lim wore it in a TikTok video. Amy Neben, a partner at Select Management Group, says she\u2019s signing native TikTokers and encouraging other clients to join the platform because \u201cthe audience on TikTok is very highly engaged.\u201d Select recently signed its first native TikTok creator, Ben De Almeida, known as @Benoftheweek (2.4 million TikTok followers), who has since posted sponsored videos with NYX Cosmetics and Old Spice. According to Neben, De Almeida was getting \u201ca lot of inquiries\u201d from brands and needed someone to negotiate on his behalf. Sponsored TikTok videos typically earn a top creator no more than $20,000 or $30,000, though a Hollywood star like Will Smith could fetch up to six figures. how i go from RAT to THAT thanks to @nyxcosmetics #BornToGlow #Ad #BornToGlow \u2013 NYX Cosmetics  TikTok has created tools on its site to enable partnerships with lifestyle companies, including a beta program that allows some users to link directly from videos to shop websites to buy products, which Neben says is of \u201cbig\u201d importance to brands. TikTok Creator Marketplace, launched in September, allows TikTok-approved agencies and brands to search for users using filters (such as follower count, content topics, audience analysis) to choose \u201cthe most relevant creators for their campaign,\u201d according to a TikTok spokesperson. \u201cBrands can view the most recent and popular videos with performance metrics under each creator\u2019s profile to help them further understand a creator\u2019s work.\u201d Several fashion labels have started \u201cchallenges\u201d or campaigns on TikTok to tap into audience engagement, including Ralph Lauren in August with the #WinningRL hashtag, MAC Cosmetics in September with #YouOwnIt and NARS in December with #HolidayBeat.  Neben notes, however, that so far, \u201cbrands are more familiar with Instagram \u2014 it\u2019s a proven platform.\u201d TikTok also presents some challenges for fashion companies because product exposure is fleeting, with posts running just 15 or 60 seconds. Says Greg Goodfried, co-head of UTA\u2019s digital talent division, about the platform\u2019s long-term prospects: \u201cThere\u2019s a great unknown with TikTok. It\u2019s very much a wait-and-see approach.\u201d Updated Jan. 8 at 3 p.m. A version of this story first appeared in the Jan. 8 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.
