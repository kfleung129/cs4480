    "title": "'Gangnam Style' at 10: How Psy's smash hit sent Korean culture global | CNN",
    "text": "The early 2010s were an era of instant hits. From the \u201cHarlem Shake\u201d to \u201cParty Rock Anthem\u201d, digital platforms ushered in a new era of publicity \u2013 and virality. On July 15, 2012, South Korean singer and rapper Psy broke onto the global music scene with a bright blue tuxedo, an unforgettable horse-riding dance and an energetic beat that dropped to the catchy lyric, \u201cOppan Gangnam style.\u201d \u201cGangnam Style\u201d soon went viral, making waves around the world. The song hijacked the airwaves, the music video flooded Facebook timelines and Psy\u2019s slicked-back hair and sunglasses showed up on American late-night shows. The song debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 in September, before climbing to number 2 weeks later. It also became the first video to hit 1 billion views on YouTube. Psy, who was already popular in his home country but barely known globally, quickly became one of the most recognizable artists in the world. Within a year, he had broken three Guinness World Records and was performing at New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden with Madonna. For the then-35-year-old from Seoul, the whirlwind success was something he could have never imagined. In an interview ahead of the song\u2019s 10-year anniversary, he compares that period of his life to celebrating a birthday. \u201cOn the day before, you\u2019re excited in anticipation,\u201d he tells CNN from the Seoul headquarters of P-Nation, the record label and entertainment agency he founded in 2018. \u201cAnd then on the day of \u2026 it\u2019s all a little wild and crazy.\u201d But the song\u2019s impact stretched far beyond the music industry. In fact, the success of \u201cGangnam Style\u201d is considered a major catalyst in the \u201cKorean wave\u201d, or \u201challyu\u201d, a term describing the recent proliferation of Korean culture internationally \u2013 something the South Korean government has been attempting to push through music and media since the 1990s. Seoul Fashion Week: A vision of Korean designers' creative future According to Gyu Tag Lee, an associate professor of cultural studies specializing in K-pop and hallyu at George Mason University\u2019s South Korean campus, it was \u201cGangnam Style\u201d that gave Korean pop culture mainstream recognition outside of East Asia. \u201cThese kinds of going-viral-on-the-internet media platforms, (such as) YouTube, made K-pop and hallyu really popular and big overseas,\u201d he says. Fast forward a decade and South Korean talents have reached new levels of global popularity and fandom. K-pop band BTS was the world\u2019s top-selling musical act in 2021, and the group has since performed at the Grammys and made an appearance at the White House to discuss Asian representation and anti-Asian hate crimes. Girl group Blackpink, meanwhile, has performed at the Coachella music festival and collaborated with the likes of Lady Gaga and Selena Gomez, with its four members all joining major brands or luxury fashion houses as ambassadors. K-pop supergroup BTS visits the White House Lee believes that these highly successful K-pop acts are following in Psy\u2019s footsteps by using shareable video content to reach global audiences. \u201cWithout the big hit that was \u2018Gangnam Style,\u2019 there may not have been BTS, there may not have been Blackpink,\u201d Lee says. BTS has often cited \u2013 and thanked \u2013 Psy for helping globalize K-pop. One of the boy band\u2019s members, Suga, even co-produced and featured on \u201cThat That\u201d , the lead single from the Psy\u2019s new album, \u201cPsy 9th\u201d. Like \u201cGangnam Style\u201d, the song is catchy and danceable, while the music video features some of the singer\u2019s signature humor and has already garnered more than 272 million views on YouTube. In a behind-the-scenes video interview, posted to Psy\u2019s YouTube account, Suga expresses his gratitude for the \u201cGangnam Style\u201d singer. \u201cHe paved the way for K-pop in the US, which allowed (BTS) to follow that path more comfortably,\u201d Suga says. And the appreciation is mutual. \u201cI think it\u2019s an incredible feat,\u201d Psy says of BTS\u2019 success. \u201cEvery single part of me applauds them and is cheering them on. That heavy burden that I felt in 2012 \u2013 BTS has been shouldering that for six or seven years now.\u201d For Psy, there has always been another side to his global success. As excited and happy as he was during those \u201cGangnam Style\u201d days, he said that performing and being on the road left him feeling \u201cjust too overwhelmed\u201d and \u201ca little empty inside.\u201d Fame also brought about new expectations \u2013 and the pressure to make more hits. Dior hosts runway show in South Korea for the first time \u201cWhen the song is a hit, then your songs need to continue to be hits,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen the person is a hit, the success is more sustainable. In this case, I\u2019m the former and BTS is the latter.\u201d While Psy never replicated the success of \u201cGangnam Style\u201d, he has spent the last decade proving himself to be a musician and dancer with a singular drive to entertain. Since 2012, he has released three full-length albums that showcase his diverse style \u2013 from the dance hits he\u2019s best known for, to softer, rhythmic ballads reminiscent of his earlier output. Since founding P-Nation, he has used the label to discover, develop and creatively support the next generation of South Korean acts. Between it all, Psy is still filling venues in his home country. His annual concert series, \u201cSummer Swag\u201d is currently underway after being canceled due to the pandemic. \u201cInteracting with audiences (and) sharing that experience is something I can\u2019t even describe,\u201d Psy says. \u201cI feel incredibly proud and content in that moment.\u201d And his mission hasn\u2019t changed since his breakout hit: \u201cTo make fun music, fun dances and bring joy to my fans.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s my hope,\u201d he adds. \u201cI was of the same mind 10 years ago and I think I\u2019ll feel the same way 20 years from now as well. I\u2019ll always be true to that.\u201d Watch the video above to hear more from Psy. \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.
