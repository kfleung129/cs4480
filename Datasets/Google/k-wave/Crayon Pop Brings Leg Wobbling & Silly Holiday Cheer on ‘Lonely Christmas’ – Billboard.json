    "text": "After riding a viral wave to their first K-Pop Hot 100 No. 1 with \"Bar Bar Bar,\" Crayon Pop the K-pop girl group bring their fun antics for a holiday concept for \"Lonely Christmas.\" By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJeff Benjamin Earlier this year, rookie K-pop group Crayon Pop found itself at No. 1 on the K-Pop Hot 100 following a viral response to the video for its fourth single \u201cBar Bar Bar.\u201d Now, the quintet is mixing its quirky-cute charms with holiday music on its latest release, \u201cLonely Christmas.\u201d Explore\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tExplore\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee latest videos, charts and news\n\n\n\nSee latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news Notably, the production for \u201cLonely Christmas\u201d is much higher production than \u201cBar Bar Bar\u201d with loads of energetic synths, trumpets and guitars backing the girls\u2019 singing and cheers. In fact, the girls\u2019 voices sound harmonious, even sultry, on the final notes of the bridge.

Don\u2019t worry, be happy!\u201d is a fun, easy to remember and rolls off the tongue easier than \u201cBar Bar Bar\u201d hook, \u201cI don\u2019t want to stick at home now.\u201d  The accompanying music video also sees Crayon Pop using a similar formula that earned the group over 13 million collective views for the two \u201cBar Bar Bar\u201d vids. Again, the girls\u00a0bounce around to silly, easy-to-follow choreography. But instead of the \u201cstraight-five-engine dance,\u201d the girls are betting on a shaky leg dance \u2014 that looks even more hilarious when one member performs it (see Ellin at 1:16) \u2014 as the signature move. Similar to what PSY did with his \u201cGangnam Style\u201d follow-up video \u201cGentleman,\u201d the girls are playing off similar elements of what made the public fall in love with them in the first place. Crayon Pop\u2019s \u201cLonely Christmas\u201d outshines \u201cBar Bar Bar\u201d in terms of song composition and hook, but the public could soon grow weary of the same formula if the music and group doesn\u2019t continue to show growth.
