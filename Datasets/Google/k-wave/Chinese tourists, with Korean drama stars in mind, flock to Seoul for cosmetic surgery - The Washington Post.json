    "text": "clockThis article was published more than\u00a09 years ago All around the southern Seoul district of Gangnam \u2014 the area of conspicuous consumption made famous by the hit song \u201cGangnam Style\u201d \u2014 Chinese women walk down the street with bandages over their faces and around their heads. Some, despite hoodies pulled up and parasols pulled down, are so badly bruised and swollen that they look as if they\u2019ve just survived a car accident \u2014 if only barely. They\u2019re riding the latest crest of the Korean Wave: plastic surgery. Korean cultural exports \u2014 especially the manufactured \u201cK-Pop\u201d music and schmaltzy soap operas \u2014 have become a phenomenon across Asia. There\u2019s a huge following in China, in particular, and an increasing number of fans are coming to South Korea not just for shopping and sightseeing, but also for nips and tucks \u2014 and more. \"Naturally, Korean dramas and K-Pop has a lot to do with it,\" said Hong Sung-bum, a plastic surgeon and the director of the BK Hospital, a 15-story building in Gangnam devoted to various kinds of cosmetic additions or subtractions, which employs 30 Chinese-speaking staff. \u201cThere are lots of Chinese patients who come here asking to look like a certain Korean Wave star,\u201d he said in his office, still wearing his blue scrubs and rubber clogs. On the desk sat a skull wearing a Burberry-pattern headband. Right now, the hottest look is Jun Ji-hyun, the star of \u201cMy Love From the Star,\u201d a soap opera with an unlikely story line: An alien accidentally arrives on Earth 400 years ago, meets an arrogant female pop star and falls in love. Women covet not just Jun\u2019s wardrobe and her lifestyle, but her face, too. But don\u2019t think this is just a female thing. A considerable number of men want to look more like Kim Soo-hyun, who plays the alien character. As the Korean government promotes ever-closer economic relations with China, it is busily promoting a \u201cKorean medical wave.\u201d The Korean Tourism Organization regularly organizes plastic surgery expos in Beijing and Shanghai, where K-Pop singers and dancers perform and women learn how to do their makeup like Korean Wave stars. Groups of doctors offer advice to prospective patients. \u201cWe tell them that these people are not just doctors, they\u2019re beauty designers,\u201d said Kim Su-jin, an official at the KTO\u2019s medical tourism division. The Korean surgery craze is part of a broader boom in tourism from China and comes as arrivals from Japan have fallen sharply amid worsening geo\u00adpolitical tensions. According to KTO figures, 56,075 Chinese visitors had medical treatment in South Korea last year, rising 26.5\u00a0percent from the previous year and up from just 4,725 in 2009. (Not all of them had plastic surgery: The numbers for 2013 have not yet been released, but almost 10,000 Chinese had plastic surgery in Korea in 2012.) \u201cThe Korean dramas definitely had an effect on my decision to come here,\u201d said Xu Xiao Hong, a 28-year-old office worker from Tsingtao, who was visiting the BK clinic during a shopping trip to Korea. \u201cI think Korean actresses are very beautiful,\u201d she said. Carefully made up and trendily dressed in short shorts and platform sandals, she cut a stylish figure. What\u2019s more, she had a megawatt smile. But Xu said she had a complex about her cheekbones. They were too prominent, she said, and she wanted to find out about having them fixed. \u201cNormally it doesn\u2019t bother me, but when I see myself in photos, all I can see is my cheeks,\u201d she said in one of the consultation rooms at BK. She is getting married next year and wants her wedding pictures to be perfect. Her fiance \u2014 who, she said, had no complaints about her appearance \u2014 knew she was in Korea but not that she was consulting a plastic surgeon. \u201cIf the consultation goes well, I will talk to my boyfriend and my parents about it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty big operation.\u201d Indeed, it is. While the most common procedures are operations to make Caucasian-style double-eyelids (with clinics charging $700 to $1,500) and nose jobs ($1,500 to $4,500), a sizable proportion of patients, like Xu, want \u201cfacial contouring\u201d \u2014 invasive surgery that involves shaving or chopping away bones. One particularly common procedure \u2014 which Hong, the surgeon, calls \u201csuper smile surgery\u201d \u2014 is for patients who think their chins are too prominent. It involves cutting whole sections out of their jawbones so that their entire mouth and chin can be pushed back. Although it takes only three hours, the recovery takes a good six months. There have been reports of women suffering from severe complications \u2014 such as jaws that no longer meet \u2014 and even deaths during some of the more invasive operations. But Hong says the most common risk is patient dissatisfaction. \u201cThis is not a clothing store where you can shop for the clothes that Jun wears,\u201d Hong says. \u201cWhen a patient comes in and says that they want to look like her, we go through a consultation process and try to find a halfway point.\u201d The Korean plastic surgery craze creates big business in China, too. Chinese travel agencies offer tour packages that combine several days of sightseeing with longer periods of plastic surgery. Ocean International Travel Service offers a typical five-day tour for about $1,000, surgeries not included. The plastic surgery industry has become so dominant in Gangnam that some intersections feature clinics on all four corners. The underpasses to the subway station are wallpapered with ads for cosmetic enhancements. Sitting up in a hospital bed in a recovery room at BK, with a blue mask over her mouth and a drip in her arm, Chen Mao said she started aging more rapidly when she hit 35 three years ago and wanted to do something about it. She had fat from her midriff injected into her face to smooth out the lines, a procedure that she said appealed to her because it didn\u2019t involve going under the knife. \u201cI want to look more youthful, and with this procedure, I can have a better texture,\u201d Chen said, patting her bandages. On this trip, she\u2019s been seeing some tourist sites, doing a lot of shopping and eating in nice restaurants. \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot to help the Korean economy,\u201d she laughed, estimating that she had spent a total of $8,000. As with Xu, it was the Korean Wave that washed her ashore here. \u201cI know that Korean celebrities\u2019 beauty is not natural, and I know that they all have their surgeries done in Gangnam,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I wanted to be like them and invest my time and money here, too.\u201d Hallie Gu in Beijing contributed to this report.
