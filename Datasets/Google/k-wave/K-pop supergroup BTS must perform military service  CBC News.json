    "text": "Hit South Korean boy band BTS will\u00a0not be given exemption from mandatory military service, the Defence Ministry has said, reaffirming its policy of no\u00a0exceptions for pop stars. The decision is likely to fuel debate in South Korea, which\u00a0remains technically at war with North Korea, about whether\u00a0entertainers and athletes should have to do their full military\u00a0service, of about 18 months, when they might be at the peak of\u00a0their careers. \"Exempting pop culture artists from military service even\u00a0though they have made a contribution to the country's reputation\u00a0is not in line with the government's stance to uphold justice\u00a0and fairness,\" the ministry said in announcing its decision on\u00a0Thursday. The seven-strong BTS has spearheaded a wave of Korean pop,\u00a0crowning their success with three No. 1 albums on the Billboard\u00a0chart in less than a year, a 2019 Grammy nomination and concerts\u00a0from New York to Saudi Arabia. Fans of the group have been trying\u00a0for months to petition the government to extend exemptions to pop groups, but this recent\u00a0decision has\u00a0dashed those hopes. The band's oldest member, Kim Seok-jin, turns 27 in December, meaning he will have to register for his mandatory service in the near future. None of the band members, who range in age from 22 to 26,\u00a0were\u00a0available for comment on Friday. Korean men who turn 18 become eligible for a physical\u00a0examination by the Military Manpower Administration, which can\u00a0then lead to service. Women do not have to do military service. Authorities occasionally grants exemptions, for instance to\u00a0athletes, but only if they have won gold medals at the Asian\u00a0Games, or any medal at the Olympics. Also, classical musicians who have received awards at\u00a0recognized international competition can skip their military\u00a0service. Last year, Son Heung-min, who plays for the English Premier\u00a0League side Tottenham Hotspur, was given an exemption but only\u00a0after he helped the South Korean national team win gold at the\u00a0Asian Games. The Defence Ministry said fewer than 45 people are exempt\u00a0from service every year. South Korea has nearly 600,000 soldiers, most of them\u00a0conscripted. Audience Relations, CBC P.O.
