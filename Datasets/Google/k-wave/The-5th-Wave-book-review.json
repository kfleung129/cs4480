    "text": "You can\u2019t swing a dead zombie cat these days without hitting a movie or a TV show that takes place in some postapocalyptic, dystopian future. Nowhere is this more evident than in young-adult literature, which may be nearing its saturation point in tales of brave young women placed in life-threatening situations, with the world\u2019s survival resting on their narrow shoulders. Rick Yancey\u2019s The 5th Wave is a remarkable, not-to-be-missed-under-any-circumstances book in part because it manages to describe an invasion by aliens \u2014 or in 5th Wave-speak, \u201dthe Others\u201d \u2014 and leave you thinking, Oh, so this is how things will actually happen. Some people hunker down in makeshift bunkers. Some head to Disney World (until the Others cut off all electricity). Everyone misses the Internet. Cassie, our 16-year-old heroine, notes wryly how off base Hollywood was in depicting extraterrestrials as vaguely resembling humans: \u201dI bet the Others knew about the\u2026aliens we\u2019d imagined. And I bet they thought it was funny as hell. They must have laughed their asses off. If they have a sense of humor\u2026or asses.\u201d Cassie never loses her sense of humor \u2014 even when describing the circumstances that have left her orphaned and thinking she\u2019s the last human on the planet. She\u2019s not, of course. There\u2019s a mysterious, hunky boy in the woods whom she can\u2019t decide whether to trust. Yancey nails the full-body eye roll of teenage speech: Even in the midst of thrilling action scenes, Cassie still has time to be insecure about her hair. But he also makes room for lovely poetic language, as when Cassie says that without the constant hum of electricity she \u201dcan hear the stars scraping against the sky.\u201d While 5th Wave may technically be YA, the novel can\u2019t be wedged into one genre. It has the dark, swoopy adrenaline of The Hunger Games, but the elegiac tone of The Road. Who cares what shelf you find it on? Just read it. A Coming to theaters: Sony has made a significant six-figure deal to launch a franchise based on what Yancey expects to be a trilogy. Producers include Graham King (Argo) and Tobey Maguire. ",
