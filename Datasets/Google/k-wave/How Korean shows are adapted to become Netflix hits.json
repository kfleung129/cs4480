Netflix has found its latest with the new zombie-infected Korean drama, or K-drama, \u201cAll of Us Are Dead.\u201d\u00a0And it's using what is proving to be a reliable recipe for success. Since premiering Jan. 28, the series has appeared in Netflix\u2019s daily Top 10 lists in 94 countries \u2014 including No. 1 in the U.S. \u2014 and, for the past two weeks, was its most-watched show globally. Given the steady churn of releases, holding this top spot is no small feat. It speaks to audiences\u2019 increasingly insatiable appetite for Korean content, both in the U.S. and internationally. It\u2019s an appetite that Netflix and the Korean entertainment industry, which has been a major player in the world entertainment landscape for decades, have long been looking to capitalize on. \u201cWith Korean cinema, and with K-pop in particular, there is already a ready-made, built-in media template for thinking about how Korean stories can reach audiences, throughout different regions in East Asia and beyond,\u201d Dan O\u2019Neill, an associate professor of modern literature and media studies at the University of California, Berkeley told NBC News. \u201cThere\u2019s already a built-in industry ambition to have this phenomenon be more than just a Korean phenomenon, and it\u2019s backed by a lot of investment from the government and so forth.\u201d For its part, Netflix has been funneling money into Korean content for years, recently upping the ante with an investment approaching $500 million in 2021 and, reportedly, an even larger sum this year. That investment has paid off with big hits like \u201cSquid Game,\u201d which became Netflix\u2019s most successful series launch of all time; \u201cMy Name\u201d; and \u201cHellbound,\u201d among others. While the popularity of Korean dramas is nothing new \u2014 often cited as the driver behind the steadily rising global regard for Korean cultural productions, called the \u201cKorean wave\u201d \u2014 their status as megahits in the U.S. does signal a significant shift. Series by series, Korean dramas are toppling conventional wisdom about Americans\u2019 interest in foreign-language productions. \u201cAll of Us Are Dead\u201d \u2014 from creators Lee Jae-kyu, Kim Nam-su and Chun Sung-il \u2014 is about high schoolers at ground zero of a zombie apocalypse in the fictional South Korean city Hyosan. A group of fresh-faced actors \u2014 including stars Park Ji-hu, Yoon Chan-young, Park Solomon and Cho Yi-hyun\u00a0\u2014 play the teenagers fighting for survival in their school\u2019s corridors and classroom, as the infection rapidly consumes the city, along with their loved ones. The Korean drama is inspired by a popular 2009 webtoon, a genre of digital comic that originated in South Korea in the early aughts and is consumed via infinite scroll. In the intensifying race to release new content, webtoons have become fodder for Korean filmmakers and big-ticket items for streaming platforms. Netflix\u2019s buzzy \u201cSquid Game\u201d and \u201cHellbound,\u201d along with Apple TV+\u2019s \u201cDr. Brain\u201d and Disney+\u2019s upcoming \u201cMoving,\u201d are all webtoon-inspired. \u201cAdapting a popular webtoon for a TV show is a relatively easy way to guarantee success,\u201d Areum Jeong, a Korean film expert at Sichuan University-Pittsburgh Institute, said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s announced that a popular webtoon will be adapted into a show, there is a lot of attention on who will be cast. These speculations become viral on social media and lead to viewership.\u201d Another key to these shows' success is the high production value that\u2019s become a hallmark of Korean entertainment, and K-dramas in particular. It\u2019s one of the areas where Netflix and Korean content have been so symbiotic. \u201cWe pay a lot of attention to the visualization, the set, the music and making the storyline simpler, so it\u2019s more approachable and easy to tune in for viewers who may not be K-drama fans before,\u201d Don Kang, Netflix Korea\u2019s vice president of content, said. There\u2019s a term for what Kang is describing: the Netflix effect. For years, people have been using the term to describe how the platform launches productions and careers into infamy. But it also implies a certain aesthetic, a polish that only comes with a streaming giant\u2019s almost unrivaled spending power. \u201cAll of Us Are Dead\u201d follows the uber-successful K-drama model of combining Korean storytelling and high production value with a genre that lends itself to exploring themes on morality \u2014 like the zombie movie. The series is a heart-pounding combination of horror and character-building that delves into its subjects\u2019 humanity right before they\u2019re viciously cannibalized and reborn as flesh-hungry monsters. \u201cThe filmmakers grew up watching a lot of American cinema, as well as Japanese, so they\u2019re well-versed in genre,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cThat\u2019s their foothold into this, sort of, world cinema landscape. To be familiar with genre cinema \u2014 what people recognize at the lowest common denominator \u2014 that\u2019s what they\u2019re good at. And there\u2019s a way in which Korean cinema blurs that boundary between art cinema and genre cinema in ways that other traditions have not been able to do.\u201d \u201cAll of Us Are Dead\u201d has the traits of a classic Hollywood zombie film. There are the usual metaphors around contagion, containment and survival, along with plenty of stomach-turning scenes. But the way it unfolds is more like a chamber drama than an action flick. As the students band together for mutual survival, making their way from classroom to classroom in the hopes of being rescued, they\u2019re forced to weigh self-preservation against morality and the collective well-being. \u201cThese works share a commonality in questioning what humanity is, especially how human dignity can be performed or preserved in dystopian settings,\u201d Jeong said. In the end, perhaps more unsettling than the undead creatures roaming the halls are the questions they raise about what it means to survive. How long Netflix will be able to beat back the competition, when it comes to both Korean content and fans flocking to the platform to consume it, remains to be seen. Kang said Netflix would be staying the course when it comes to its investment strategy: \u201cWe\u2019ve invested more than 1 trillion won, so far, in Korean content. And we will continue to be committed to supporting local creators and introducing their shows globally.\u201d But, as many people have pointed out, it\u2019s more about the accessibility of a platform than it is about the name behind it. With the floodgates fully opened, it\u2019s hard to imagine any one company, or sector, containing the Korean wave. \u201cNetflix is not the only story in this,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cIt\u2019s about social media. It\u2019s about film culture, expanding through these new platforms, generating interest in many different ways that we can\u2019t possibly anticipate.\u201d Elaina Patton is a freelance entertainment and culture writer. \u00a9\u00a02023 NBC UNIVERSAL ",
