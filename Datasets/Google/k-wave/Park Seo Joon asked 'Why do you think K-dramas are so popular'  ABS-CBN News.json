One year later, he told Sam Oh in an interview with Smart K-Life that he feels the same way seeing how the Korean wave has been sweeping over the Philippines. \u201cIt was surprising because I don\u2019t take on a project expecting popularity and love. I\u2019m also fascinated because our languages are different. I don\u2019t I really feel it until now, it still doesn\u2019t feel real. It\u2019s also amusing but most of all, I\u2019m very grateful,\u201d he said in Korean. When asked why he thinks K-dramas became so popular even outside South Korea, he said: \u201cI\u2019m no analyst so I\u2019m not sure. But if I were to venture a guess, I\u2019d think that anyone in the world can relate to the human emotions and feelings of the situations that arise on these K-dramas. I also think the actors and crew of K-dramas have improved a great deal which leads to better programs.\u201d But for the 31-year-old actor, it\u2019s the interest of fans that is the biggest factor. \u201cIf there was no interest from people, we would be easily forgotten\u201d he said. On a lighter note, Park also shared during the interview with Oh his favorite Korean food as well as some tips or advice on skin care and fashion. \u201cFor food, based on a show I did where I ran a restaurant abroad, I found that bibimbap is the most popular. It\u2019s one of the tastiest dishes as a Korean. But I think foreigners also like that it\u2019s a complete and healthy meal so I would recommend that,\u201d he said. For skin care, Park said the most important thing to know is one\u2019s skin type. \u201cI don\u2019t wear makeup often but when I do, I think removing it well is important. This is basic stuff that everyone knows, so I don\u2019t know if I have any tips,\u201d he said. He also talked about fashion trends, saying, \u201cI think it\u2019s best to know your body type and dress the way you like. If you can dress to reflect your interests, I think that\u2019s good too.\u201d Park\u2019s interview was part of Smart Communication\u2019s announcement that he is its latest international endorser following Hyun Bin and Son Ye Jin of \u201cCrash Landing On You.\u201d Like the two, Park is also set to visit the Philippines in the future when travel restrictions ease up. Park is notable for starring in the dramas \"She Was Pretty,\" \"Hwarang,\" \"Fight For My Way,\" and \"What's Wrong with Secretary Kim.\" Most recently, he starred in the series \"Itaewon Class.\" Share US police launch manhunt for gunman who killed at least 22 October 26, 2023 Pumpkins for Halloween emojis?
