You can read the full article in M\u0101ori here. Earlier this year, I met an Aucklander whose teenage passion for K-pop sparked an interest in the Korean language and culture in general, and led to them learning Korean as a second language. It made me wonder what lessons could be learnt for the revitalisation of the M\u0101ori language. Specifically, given the importance of teenagers in those revitalisation efforts, what can we learn from the way the so-called \u201cKorean Wave\u201d is subverting the English language as the language of popular culture? There is already work being done in this area. The central argument of Dr Hinurewa Poutu\u2019s PhD research in 2015 concerned the need to create opportunities for M\u0101ori to be considered \u201ccool\u201d by adolescents. As she stated at the time: English tends to be used socially, as there aren\u2019t enough opportunities to hear M\u0101ori in social situations or to learn M\u0101ori expressions for gossiping with your friends, courting, playing. For most kids, te reo M\u0101ori is used in formal contexts only. Five years on, AUT\u2019s Te Ipukarea Research Institute is leading a project looking at how the M\u0101ori language can be better supported in the lives of adolescents. Funded by Ng\u0101 Pae o te M\u0101ramatanga, this research is based on the idea the M\u0101ori language of adolescence forms the building blocks of non-formal adult language. In other words, it is about the informal language of friendship, humour, relationships, emotions and mental health that sets a pattern for everyday use later in life. Our preliminary findings show the potential strategic importance of the adolescent age group for M\u0101ori language revitalisation. Teenagers are trendsetters \u2013 as such, they can have an impact on (and be influenced by) the perceived value of the M\u0101ori language and therefore its status. However, a previous study by Te Ipukarea found there are few M\u0101ori language resources and not much M\u0101ori language content (novels, TV, music, games) aimed at this age group.

When it comes to what is considered \u201ccool\u201d, of course, the influence of entertainment, social media and pop culture on adolescents is clear. After meeting the K-pop-loving Korean language graduate, I began to imagine what it might look like if the M\u0101ori language revitalisation movement tapped into that age-group: trendsetting, fandom-building teens. The Korean Wave is challenging the dominance of English as the lingua franca of pop culture. The rise in popularity of K-pop, K-dramas (which Netflix has acquired and invested in) and films such as  Parasite (winner of the 2020 best picture Oscar, the first \u201cforeign language\u201d film to do so) with non-Korean audiences shows language is no longer the barrier it once was. These forms of entertainment have simply become part of the wider popular culture. Take Korean group BTS (also known as the Bangtan Boys) \u2013 currently among the biggest pop acts in the world, consistently breaking records and garnering a huge worldwide fan base. Read more:\n      M\u0101ori loanwords in NZ English are less about meaning, more about identity BTS can sing in English but choose to release the majority of their music and other content (a variety show, a travel show, movies, behind-the-scenes footage) in Korean. This year they released Learn Korean with BTS, underscoring the link between the Korean Wave and the uptick in numbers learning the Korean language. There are obvious differences between Korean and M\u0101ori. M\u0101ori is still a recovering, minority language, while Korean has over 50 million speakers in South Korea alone. However, if young people in Aotearoa are inspired by Korean pop culture to learn the Korean language, it at least provides an insight into what the M\u0101ori language revitalisation movement can learn from the Korean Wave. Read more:\n      Kia ora: how M\u0101ori borrowings shape New Zealand English The Korean Wave is actually the result of a hugely successful strategic push by the Korean government to export its culture to the world and boost its \u201csoft power\u201d. In other words, Korea set out to be the coolest culture in the world. With that in mind, strategically resourcing the production of M\u0101ori language content for pop culture needs to be a priority in any plan to capture the adolescent age group. I hope that one day M\u0101ori language music will consistently enter the charts, my Netflix list will be full of M\u0101ori language dramas, and a M\u0101ori language film will be promoted and celebrated the way Parasite has been.
