    "text": "When K Trap first came to the UK drill scene, he was an enigma. Sporting a black balaclava, his identity was a mystery. But coming in backed by the production of Carns Hill will always give you a leg up in drill. So, armed with magical beats, K Trap poured his soul onto them and spoke about the trials and tribulations he had gone through on the roads. The first song to hit the street was \u2018How' in 2017, and the harshness of his delivery caught attentions instantly. Speaking on his mode of operation, he says he\u2019ll \u201conly do something that I\u2019m comfortable with.\u201d \u2018How\u2019 was followed up with the cult classics \u2018David Blaine\u2019 and \u2018Paper Plans\u2019 later that year. \u2018Watching\u2019 came out in 2018 and included the epic one-liner: \u201cI copped me a lil pump, way before I turned Gucci Gang.\u201d Most recently he released his third project,\u00a0\u2018No Magic\u2019, this past summer, which saw him taking off his mask and revealing his identity. \u201cAt first I wasn\u2019t sure about music,\u201d he says by way of explanation regarding the mask. \u201cI was living another life too. Slowly but surely things started to progress for me in music and looked more promising. Taking off the mask was always going to be the next step once I was two feet in the music.\u201d Now that K Trap is unmasked, we are able to put a face to the name. But there is no\u00a0difference\u00a0in terms of his in-your-face lyricism and his trap-themed bars. The only thing is that with each project he is taking things to another level, and with his debut album on the way in 2020, the stratosphere is the limit for this rising rap star. His message for his fans? \u201c2020, just look out!\u201d Where: South London What: UK drill Get 3 Songs: \u2018Watching\u2019, \u2018Mask Off\u2019, \u2018Big Mood\u2019 Fact: The streets know the meaning, he says, of the title, \u2018No Magic\u2019. \u2013 \u2013 \u2013  \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Words:\u00a0Denzil Bell Photography:\u00a0Joel Smedley Fashion:\u00a0Zarina Shukri \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Join us on the ad-free creative social network\u00a0Vero, as we get under the skin of global cultural happenings.
