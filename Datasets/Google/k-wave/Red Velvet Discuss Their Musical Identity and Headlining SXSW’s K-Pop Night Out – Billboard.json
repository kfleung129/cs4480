    "text": "Red Velvet spoke Billboard to discuss their latest album 'Rookie,' headlining K-pop Night Out at SXSW, and what they'd like to pursue in the future. By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tTamar Herman Hours before making their SXSW debut at the fifth annual K-pop Night Out showcase, Red Velvet\u00a0lounged about The Belmont after finishing their sound check. The headliners for the event, the K-pop quintet is one of the genre\u2019s most prominent young acts, and artistic innovators leading a new wave of Korean girl groups. Later that night, they\u2019d press through technical difficulties \u2014 and member Irene leaving the stage temporarily to fix an audio issue \u2014 to perform some of their recent hits (\u201cRussian Roulette,\u201d \u201cRookie,\u201d \u201cDumb Dumb\u201d) and two B-sides (\u201cSomething Kinda Crazy,\u201d \u201cFool\u201d), all of which evoked riotous cheers from the crowd.

Their most recent EP Rookie, which showcased the group\u2019s versatility through songs like the whimsical \u201cHappily Ever After\u201d and the ethereal \u201cBody Talk,\u201d peaked to No. 1 on the World Albums chart upon its release in February. Irene, Wendy, Seulgi, Joy, and Yeri sat down with Billboard to discuss their music, performances at SXSW, and what they\u2019d like to pursue in the future. Welcome to the U.S.! How does it feel to be here at SXSW? Seulgi (through translator): It\u2019s our first time coming to Texas, and we\u2019re especially honored to perform at SXSW. Today we will deliver the best performance possible to captivate our fans. Red Velvet\u2019s only here for a short while since you\u2019re performing at KCON Mexico tomorrow, but is there anything you want to do while you\u2019re here? Yeri (through translator): I looked up online to see what there is to do in Texas and I want to eat steak if there\u2019s time. [Laughs.]  You recently released Rookie, and the single is doing really well in Korea. How does it feel? Irene (through translator): \u201cRookie\u201d is still receiving a lot of love and ranking high on Korean charts, even though we finished promoting it in February, so we\u2019re really happy for all of the love from our fans.  Wendy: We compare our lover to a rookie and we want to mesmerize people with our song. People actually loved our song and we\u2019re very thankful about it [still charting well in Korea]. Why do you think people like Red Velvet\u2019s funky, quirky style so much? Seulgi: I think, and actually heard from our fans, that listeners get energized by our songs. And because of our various music styles, everyone can find something they enjoy regardless of their age and gender. You\u2019re under SM Entertainment, which houses other popular girl groups (Girls\u2019 Generation and f(x)). What differentiates Red Velvet from other SM acts? Wendy: Each of us has our own talents and that adds up to [us] as one and that\u2019s what becomes a group, as Red Velvet. We make up songs that are different than theirs. I don\u2019t know how to explain this. Even though we do the same genres, it\u2019s different. If you listen to it, you can feel it within your heart that it\u2019s different. But each of us has different talents and we have different ways that we sing our music styles, and that adds up to one thing and that makes up Red Velvet. Red Velvet definitely already has a clear musical identity, but are there any other styles or concepts you\u2019d like to try? Wendy: Girl crush, kind of? Can you explain the idea of a \u2018girl crush\u2019 musical concept? W: Oh that\u2019s like a Korean thing? [Laughs.] I want us to wear a suit with a fedora hat. You can kind of think of [Girls\u2019 Generation\u2019s] \u201cMr.Mr\u201d but more manly. So agendered, maybe? Wendy: Yes. But then the vocal style would be sexy. You know what I\u2019m saying?  Joy (through translator): For me, maybe something like Christina Aguilera\u2019s \u201cCandyman.\u201d Seulgi:- Beyonc\u00e9! Like \u201cSingle Ladies\u201d or \u201cRun the World (Girls).\u201d I was especially very moved by the stage performances of \u201cRun the World.\u201d Beyonce is absolutely the best. I want to try new styles inspired by her. How about your favorite Red Velvet songs? Yeri: \u201cRookie\u201d is the best so far. Joy: I like \u201cRussian Roulette\u201d the most. Seulgi: \u201cRookie\u201d was the most fun project until now for me. Wendy: \u201cIce Cream Cake,\u201d because that\u2019s when Yeri came in. (Yeri [in English]: Ooh! Thank you.) Irene: \u201cWish Tree,\u201d our seasonal song that\u2019s a good fit for the Christmas season. Please listen to it. It\u2019s a great song.  Though Sistar\u2019s Hyolyn is also performing, you\u2019re the only K-pop idol group performing at SXSW alongside some hip hop and rock acts. How do you think K-pop fits into SXSW? Yeri: We heard that we are the only idol group performing at SXSW this time. It\u2019s such an honor to share the stage with the such legendary acts like Tiger JK and Yoonmirae. We will do our best to show our distinctive, youthful sound and energetic style. You\u2019re even headlining, so that\u2019s pretty exciting! Wendy: I think we\u2019re like the decorations at the end. [Laughs] The sprinkles on top. What else can we look forward to from Red Velvet throughout the rest of the year? Yeri: About a month has passed since we completed our Rookie album activities, so there are no plans yet for our next album but we\u2019re focusing on individual projects. We are also hoping to meet more of our overseas fans. Anything else you\u2019d like to say to Billboard\u2019s audience? Yeri: Our \u201cRookie\u201d song is very fun so please check it out. It\u2019s very addictive and you will be able to easily sing along. We want to come to meet our fans more often. Thank you so much for loving Red Velvet. We love you.
