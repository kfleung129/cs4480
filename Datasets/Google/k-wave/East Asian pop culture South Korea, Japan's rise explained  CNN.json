    "text": "The year was 2009, and the thudding electronic beats of Lady Gaga\u2019s \u201cBad Romance\u201d played everywhere. Around the world, people flocked to see futuristic sci-fi flick \u201cAvatar,\u201d and tuned in to watch fun-loving housemates get wild on reality television show \u201cJersey Shore.\u201d A decade on, and the English-speaking world remains dominated by American-made music, films and television. But there\u2019s been a noticeable shift: a steady rise in the influence of South Korean and Japanese pop culture exports. In 2019, Japanese consultant Marie Kondo taught us how to declutter our lives in her Netflix hit \u201cTidying Up with Marie Kondo.\u201d  South Korean pop groups BTS and Blackpink showed us big-budget, action-packed music videos \u2013 and smashed YouTube records in the process. And \u201cParasite\u201d became the first South Korean film to win a Palme d\u2019Or \u2013 and then the film\u2019s director Bong Joon-ho appeared on \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\u201d speaking mainly in Korean. That capped off a decade that\u2019s seen the rise of East Asian pop culture in the West, including the catchy \u201cGangnam Style\u201d by flamboyant South Korean rapper PSY (2012) and the glacially-slow romances in Japanese reality show \u201cTerrace House\u201d (which came to Netflix in 2015). Top English-language fashion magazines like \u201cVogue\u201d and \u201cElle\u201d now regularly feature South Korean beauty products, apparently endorsed by actresses Drew Barrymore and Emma Stone. \u201cAsia is becoming an increasingly significant cultural force,\u201d consulting firm McKinsey noted in a 2019 discussion paper. \u201cIn contrast to the past when the region was largely a recipient of Western culture with Asian citizens enthusiastic consumers of Hollywood movies and British pop music, for instance, today cultural flows go in both directions.\u201d So what changed? A decade ago, Japanese anime like Pokemon and Digimon was already a fixture in the West. Hong Kong martial arts stars Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee were household names. Analysts were already using the phrase \u201challyu\u201d \u2013 or \u201cKorean wave\u201d in Korean \u2013 to refer to the spread of South Korean fashion, beauty products, television dramas and music in other countries, especially in Asia. \u201c(People say) \u2018the East is coming.\u2019 In fact, it has been for a while,\u201d said Anthony Fung, an expert in pop culture at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. But in the past decade, East Asian pop culture \u2013 particularly from South Korea \u2013 has really taken off. Now there\u2019s not just one kung fu star or one anime, but a range of different East Asian exports. And, say experts, there\u2019s a few reasons for that. Jung-Sun Park, a professor and coordinator of Asian-Pacific studies at California State University at Dominguez Hills, says social media and the internet have \u201ctotally transformed the transnational flows of pop culture.\u201d How a boy band from South Korea became the biggest in the world \u201cThe various social media platforms have revolutionized the ways in which individuals encounter and consume pop culture and have greatly diversified the routes of pop cultural flows and influences,\u201d she told CNN. In the past, traditional media platforms like television and radio stations have controlled what we see and hear. East Asian pop culture also offers something else: diversity. Susanna Lim, a professor of Asian studies at the University of Oregon, says Western fans are demanding greater diversity than they did in the past. She points to K-pop fans as an example, noting that many are from diverse backgrounds, and may also feel marginalized by American mainstream culture. \u201cThe growing interest in East Asian pop culture reflects these changing demographics and cultural awareness in the US and the West,\u201d she said. K-pop is packed full of Western influences, so it can feel both familiar and unfamiliar to Western audiences, Lim added. Of course, there\u2019s also been a big push from governments. With a population of 51 million, South Korea didn\u2019t have a big enough market to sustain its entertainment industry, so needed to go abroad, said Fung, from the Chinese University of Hong Kong. South Korea\u2019s government has backed the country\u2019s cultural expansion, seeing it is a vehicle for soft power and a way to boost the nation\u2019s reputation. In 2010, Japan announced it would pump 19 billion yen (then equivalent to $237 million) into the creative sector in 2011 to make more money from the country\u2019s creative industries, like anime, graphic design, film and fashion. Opinion is divided over the plan\u2019s success. But to fans, the real reason Japanese and South Korean culture exports have taken off is simple: they\u2019re entertaining. As David Kim, a co-host of K-pop YouTube channel DKDKTV, said in a recent Instagram video: \u201cMy question is, why can\u2019t (K-pop) be a thing in Western culture?\u201d Western fans of K-pop and other cultural products might initially be drawn in by flashy dance moves and edgy fashion, but it\u2019s having a ripple effect in other areas. Enrollments in Japanese and Korean programs in the United States increased between 2013 and 2016, even as admissions to all other language courses apart than English declined, according to a study by the Modern Language Association of America. Enrollments for Korean language programs rose by 13.7%, by far the largest increase of any language being taught. K-pop is also boosting tourist arrivals to South Korea. According to Korean think tank Hyundai Research Institute, K-pop group BTS helped inspire an estimated one in 13 tourists that visited the country in 2017. That same report found that, if BTS maintain their popularity, they will contribute a projected 56.16 trillion South Korean won ($48 billion) to the country\u2019s economy by 2023. It\u2019s no surprise then that South Korea uses K-pop to market itself to tourists. South Korea\u2019s largest airline, Korean Air, features K-pop group SuperM in its latest in-flight video, and Visit Seoul \u2013 the city\u2019s tourism agency \u2013 has collaborated with BTS. And there are broader impacts too. Jo Elfving-Hwang, an associate professor of Korean Studies at the University of Western Australia, said that Korean Australians she had interviewed hadn\u2019t been interested in Korean pop culture, but started paying attention after being introduced to it by their non-Korean friends. \u201c(The rise of Korean pop culture) made Korea really cool,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is an interesting example of global popular culture that has been driven by external recognition of the cultural attractiveness rather than a push by local diasporas.\u201d The rise of K-pop has also had a positive impact for Asian male representation, she said. More Asian males have been brought into the public consciousness \u2013 a contrast from the past, where Asian male characters were often villains or kung fu stars, like Jackie Chan and Jet Li. \u201cI think there is absolutely a shift happening in that there is more visibility for Asian Americans, Asian Australians, Asian Europeans,\u201d she said. \u201cI think definitely it has had at least some impact, because now it is not unusual to see more Asians in the West on screen. I\u2019m quite excited about that.\u201d Experts say there\u2019s every reason to think Japan and South Korea\u2019s cultural exports will continue to have an impact in the coming decade. The big question mark is over China. Although China\u2019s rising economic and political influence has made it much more prominent on the world stage than it was a decade ago, it has barely made a dent on the West\u2019s pop culture landscape. For instance, China\u2019s highest grossing film, the 2017 action movie \u201cWolf Warrior 2,\u201d raked in over $854 million domestically, but only brought in $16 million overseas. Homegrown movies drive China's box office to record highs Fung says China\u2019s limited impact is partly because there\u2019s less of an economic need for Chinese entertainment companies to look abroad \u2013 it\u2019s the most populous country in the world, so there\u2019s already a huge domestic market. Another reason, though, is the strict control that China\u2019s Communist Party imposes on Chinese media. Regulators have banned actors with tattoos and censored song lyrics. Chinese state media outlets have also criticized male celebrities who appear effeminate. Elfving-Hwang says it\u2019s \u201charder to imagine\u201d the Chinese music industry ever having the same international appeal as K-pop. \u201cBut you never know,\u201d she said. In the next decade, Elfving-Hwang thinks East Asian pop culture will keep going strong \u2013 and she sees that as a good thing. \u201cIf K-pop can actually make people curious enough to take quite a big step like learning a language,\u201d she said, \u201cAnd then through that gain more understanding about the culture \u2026 I think that will have a really significant impact on how we can communicate in the future.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jake Kwon contributed to this report. \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network.
