    "title": "'Korean wave' sweeps Oxford English Dictionary as new words are added | CNN",
    "text": "Korean exports seem to be sweeping the world\u2019s screens, headsets and runways \u2013 and now more than 20 words of Korean origin have been added to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) in its September update. Over the past two decades, South Korea has churned out entertainment coveted by millions of fans, from K-pop \u2013 added to the OED in 2016 \u2013 to \u201cSquid Game,\u201d the South Korean fictional drama billed by Netflix as possibly its \u201cbiggest show ever.\u201d Koreans use the term \u201challyu\u201d to describe the phenomenon, which refers to the \u201cKorean wave\u201d of entertainment that has swept across Asia and now much of the world \u2013 and now this word has been added to the OED. Food is also prominent in the update, including \u201cbanchan,\u201d a small side dish of vegetables, served along with rice as part of a typical Korean meal, \u201cbulgogi,\u201d which are thin slices of beef or pork that are marinated and grilled or stir-fried, and \u201cdongchimi,\u201d a type of kimchi made with radish and typically also containing napa cabbage. 'Pandemic' is, unsurprisingly, the Word of the Year for Merriam-Webster and Dictionary.com \u201cHanbok,\u201d the traditional Korean costume worn by both men and women, \u201caegyo,\u201d a type of cuteness or charm considered characteristically Korean, and \u201cmukbang,\u201d a video featuring a person eating large amounts of food and talking to an audience, were also included in September\u2019s additions. \u201cK-drama,\u201d a Korean language television produced in South Korea, was also added. But not all of the recently added words are \u201cborrowings, reborrowings, or loan translations from Korean,\u201d the OED said, adding that several words are either new formations, or \u201cnew senses of existing English words.\u201d The interjection \u201cfighting!\u201d is used to convey encouragement, incitement, or support \u2013 much like \u201cgo for it!,\u201d the OED said. Meanwhile, \u201cskinship\u201d is a blend of the English words \u201cskin\u201d and \u201ckinship,\u201d referring to the touching or close physical contact between parent and child or between lovers or friends. \u201cWe are all riding the crest of the Korean wave, and this can be felt not only in film, music, or fashion, but also in our language, as evidenced by some of the words and phrases of Korean origin included in the latest update of the Oxford English Dictionary,\u201d the OED said in a statement. \u201cThe adoption and development of these Korean words in English also demonstrate how lexical innovation is no longer confined to the traditional centres of English in the United Kingdom and the United States \u2013 they show how Asians in different parts of the continent invent and exchange words within their own local contexts, then introduce these words to the rest of the English-speaking world, thus allowing the Korean wave to continue to ripple on the sea of English words,\u201d the OED added. \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network.
