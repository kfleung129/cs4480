    "text": "Published daily by the\n      \nLowy Institute The death of a K-pop star has focused attention on the high rate of suicide in South Korea. It was a difficult Christmas for the community dedicated to K-pop, the South Korean music genre that in recent years has become an international phenomenon. On 18 December 2017 the lead singer of influential K-pop band\u00a0SHINee\u00a0was found unconscious in a hotel, and was later declared dead in hospital. The singer, Kim Jong-hyun, better known as\u00a0Jonghyun,\u00a0had taken his own life. The tragedy shook the K-pop community, as singers, managers, and fans alike were forced to confront the reality of depression. Having spent almost ten years in the Korean music industry as a boy-band member, and later as a solo artist, Jonghyun was a part of K-pop\u2019s sweeping global popularity. His band, SHINee, helped spread the Hallyu\u00a0(Korean Wave), bringing Korean music and culture to an international audience. K-pop is recognised as one of Korea\u2019s greatest exports. In 2016, global revenue from K-pop music sales, concert tickets, and merchandise totalled\u00a0US$4.7 billion. SHINee is a part of SM Entertainment, one of the three major entertainment companies in South Korea, and their songs, such as \u201cLucifer\u201d and \u201c1 of 1\u201d, have topped charts worldwide. Jonghyun was also a popular singer-songwriter whose\u00a0hits include\u00a0\u201cShe Is\u201d and \u201cDeja-Boo\u201d. Having carved such a prominent role for himself in the music industry, Jonghyun\u2019s suicide rattled fans and put a spotlight on depression in South Korea. The circumstances around the star\u2019s death were highly publicised in\u00a0both local and international media. A suicide note that he sent to a friend was published on Instagram,\u00a0with the permission of Jonghyun\u2019s family, and shared widely. It revealed his struggle with depression and life in the public eye.\u00a0A memorial space was set up at Asan Medical Center, and K-pop idols were filmed entering the building to pay their respects. Fans were also welcome to visit the space and mourn together. Hundreds of fans and media crews flocked to the hospital on the day of Jonghyun\u2019s private funeral, when\u00a0his coffin was carried from the building by memebrs of boy bands SHINee and Super Junior. Jonghyun isn\u2019t the only Korean idol to have suffered from depression. In his 2016 mixtape, Suga, from boy band BTS, referred to his own struggles with fame and identity. In 2017\u00a0ChoA, from girl group AOA, left her band due to battles with insomnia and depression. Even after treatment, ChoA has said she never really feels\u00a0at peace. Rapper Woo Won-jae, who rose to fame on\u00a0the hip-hop program Show Me the Money, stands\u00a0out due to his dark lyrics which address\u00a0his difficulties with depression and loneliness. Depression and suicide is a critical problem in South Korea, a country notorious for having the highest suicide rate in the OECD. South Korea has almost 30 suicides per 100,000 population, in comparison to an OECD average closer to 12. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say Koreans are quite used to this issue,\u201d\u00a0says Dongmin, a recent Korea University graduate. \u201cThey don\u2019t make a big deal out of depression.\u201d There is a perception in South Korea that everyone is suffering in some way, whether due to academic stress, unemployment, or work-related pressures. \u201cMany people here in Korea suffer from depression, and some of them go to mental clinics to cure their illness,\u201d Dongmin says, \u201cbut they don\u2019t necessarily publicise it to their family and friends. It\u2019s not an encouraged behaviour.\u201d The stigma surrounding mental health only exacerbates the issue, as those struggling are unable to seek emotional support from their loved ones. Failing to discuss mental health issues with one another prevents Koreans from working together to raise awareness and promote change. Some people hope the highly public nature of Jonghyun\u2019s death will lead to a change in the country, particularly within the music industry. Yet the challenge is long-standing. \u201cThere have been many public suicides which are gossiped about but then quickly forgotten,\u201d\u00a0says Dongamin. One of the most notable public deaths was of former South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun, who took his own life in 2009. To reduce the suicide rate in South Korea, dramatic change\u00a0is\u00a0required to break public taboos around the discussion and treatment of mental health.\u00a0Recovery and treatment can only begin when Korea\u2019s apathy is turned into action.
