    "text": "China\u2019s loss is America\u2019s gain. At least that\u2019s according to the legions of Korean pop music fans in the US, who are proving to be unlikely beneficiaries in a long-running diplomatic spat between China and South Korea. \u201cChina is South Korea\u2019s biggest trading partner and many Chinese are big fans of Korean pop culture,\u201d said Ellen Kong, CEO of Elf Asia, a Hong Kong promotion company specializing in K-pop. \u201cBut the impact of THAAD has been substantial,\u201d she added, referencing China\u2019s staunch opposition to the US backed missile shield now housed in South Korea. \u201cIt\u2019s meant China is no longer a viable market for K-pop touring acts.\u201d The result according to industry insiders, has been a marked upswing in K-pop acts touring in the US. \u201cAround 8 years ago or so, it was very rare for K-pop artists to tour in the US, but now it has become quite common,\u201d said Paul Han, co-founder of allkpop, a site for K-pop gossip and news, which has 10 million monthly readers worldwide. Bigger than Bieber? K-pop group BTS beats US stars to win Billboard Music Award \u201cBack then, K-pop fans in the US used to say, \u2018I wish I could go to Korea to attend their concert,\u2019 but now since a lot of K-pop artists are now having concerts in New York and LA, it\u2019s more like \u2018I wish I lived closer to those cities\u2019 or \u2018I wish they would come to my city, instead of the same cities all the time\u2019\u201d added Han. In 2013, there were seven concert tours in the US, 14 in 2014 and 2015, then 20 in 2016. So far, there have been 14 in 2017 alone, including the recent tour announced by K-pop icon G-Dragon, from the extremely popular boy band Big Bang. And, for the first time a K-pop band has won a Billboard Music Award. BTS won the Top Social Artist Award on May 21. The seven-member band toured three cities in the U.S. in March and April and finish off their sold-out world tour in Japan this July. Q&A with SHINee: The Princes of K-pop \u201cWith groups unable to tour in China due to the fallout relating to the THAAD crisis, I believe we\u2019re going to see another record year for groups touring across the US this year,\u201d said CEO of Koreaboo, Flowsion Shekar, a popular content platform specializing in K-pop with a reach of over 50 million. Despite China\u2019s foreign ministry repeatedly denying that the country has placed restrictions on South Korea, the topic was outlined as an agenda item in diplomatic talks between the two countries during a visit to Beijing on Friday and Saturday by Lee Hae-chan, South Korea\u2019s special envoy. \u201cThe relationship between South Korea and China is quite strained,\u201d said Lee on Thursday before his departure. \u201cI believe the discussion will be focused to resolve economic, Korean wave, tourism interactions.\u201d Korean wave is a phrase commonly used to describe popular Korean culture and music. Not that North American K-pop fans are complaining. North Carolina teenager Kylie Grant is just one of thousands of fans for whom the arrival of mainstream K-pop acts couldn\u2019t have come sooner. Why South Korean companies, entertainers are getting cold shoulder in China \u201cIt was a once in a life-time opportunity I knew I would regret if I didn\u2019t take,\u201d said Grant, 19, who recently purchased tickets to K-pop boy band SHINee in Dallas. \u201cMy friends and family thought it was crazy at first, but after some convincing they all said it was kind of amazing that I would fly across the country just to see a concert.\u201d The tour was SHINee\u2019s first in North America, taking in Dallas, Los Angeles and Canada. At the weekend, the K-pop powerhouse performed in Hong Kong, and on June 11 in Taipei. \u201c\u2018The thought of going to see our fans that have been supporting us from so far away made my heart flutter a bit,\u201d said band member Lee Tae-min, 23, known as \u201cTaemin.\u201d In Dallas and Los Angeles, Lee and the rest of SHINee band members spoke English between the songs, sharing how much they appreciated fans learning Korean and their own love for American food, like In-N-Out burgers. Unlike the now typical mercurial K-pop bands, SHINee has been around for almost a decade, constantly evolving their look and sound. Fans, known as \u201cShawols,\u201d are drawn to SHINee for their dance choreography, along with their unique mix of R&B, electronica, rap and rock. In the last year, several K-pop bands disbanded for various reasons, including scandal. But, one of the reasons for SHINee\u2019s longevity, said Shekar, is the group\u2019s \u201czero controversy \u2026 Every member has held a pristine reputation and have earned themselves an incredible reputation with Korean and international fans.\u201d Los Angeles-based production company SubKulture Entertainment was able to almost sell out SHINee\u2019s US concerts by targeting fans online, like Grant who discovered SHINee through YouTube. K-pop's growing pains: Why Asia's biggest bands are splitting up \u201cOur customer base, like most millennials are very Internet savvy and acquire most of their information about K-pop via social media (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, etc.), which is where we like to focus the majority of our marketing efforts,\u201d said Subkulture Entertainment CEO Derek Lee. But now in their 20s, SHINee members are growing out of their \u201cboy band\u201d and \u201cPrinces of K-pop\u201d monikers. They are also near the age of military enlistment for South Korean males, a destiny that threatens to tear other bands like Big Bang apart. And while SHINee declined to talk about the military, they do plan to perform in the US again sometime soon. \u201cWe hope that through our tour, K-pop and K-pop concerts will continue to leave a mark on a market as big as the US,\u201d said Taemin. \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network.
