You'll be ready to trick-or-treat in no time... If you haven't heard\u00a0this viral hit then you're definitely out of the loop. Dress up as the ridiculous Japanese singer in his retro, animal print garb and draw on a skinny little mustache with some black eyeliner and you're good to go. If you need a costume for three, your friends can dress up as a pineapple or an apple. Make sure to bring pens. Dress up as everyone's favourite egg, Gudetama - Sanrio's lazy tamago who comes is all sorts of forms from an egg in shell to custard and even a sushi roll. Or just laze around with a bacon blanket. We won't judge. Probably the most predictable costume of the year, we're betting you'll see a whole squad of Harley Quinns and Jokers walking down the streets this Halloween. Gotta catch 'em all - or at least try to wear them all. If you're still riding\u00a0the Pok\u00e9mon craze then this costume is the best option for you. What's even better is that you can choose any Pok\u00e9mon you want to be. Didn't catch that Snorlax? Just dress up as one instead. Instead of dressing up as a typical black cat, switch it up and be inspired by\u00a0Hong Kong's very own Brother Cream this Halloween. A cute costume for any kid or adult, suit up as one of Hong Kong's very own icons, McDull.  Continue to ride the K-wave and dress up with a group of friends as your favourite Korean idols. Everybody appreciates a good sexy namja.
