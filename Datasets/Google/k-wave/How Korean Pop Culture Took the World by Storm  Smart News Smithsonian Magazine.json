The Korean Wave\u201d is an exploration of South Korea\u2019s growing cultural influence around the world. It will feature some 200 objects, plus digital displays and other pop culture ephemera organized into four thematic sections. One section, titled \u201cFrom Rubble to Smartphones,\u201d will examine South Korea\u2019s evolution from a war-torn country to a major international cultural influencer between the 1950s and the early 2000s. Another will use props, storyboards, posters and installations to explore the success of Korean films and TV series. This section will feature costumes from the recent streaming hit \u201cSquid Game,\u201d which became Netflix\u2019s most popular show just four weeks after its release. Museum-goers will also be able to step inside an immersive recreation of the bathroom from Parasite, the\u00a0first non-English-language film to win an Academy Award for Best Picture. Another section highlights the global popularity of K-pop music and the role of social media in helping artists reach fans around the world. Visitors can jam out to the 2012 hit song \u201cGangnam Style\u201d while admiring Psy\u2019s signature pink suit jacket. \u201cThe song and its quirky dance moves were an overnight sensation, and it became the first music video to reach one billion views on YouTube,\u201d writes the museum in a\u00a0statement. \u201cThe hugely successful video was an early reflection of hallyu\u2019s international appeal that went on to launch a global phenomenon, inspiring parodies and cover versions across the world, several examples of which, filmed across multiple continents, will also feature in this introduction.\u201d The final thematic section looks at Korean beauty and fashion, with a special emphasis on packaging design and contemporary designers. Hallyu means \u201cKorean wave,\u201d and the word describes the rising\u00a0worldwide popularity of Korean culture over the last two decades. Today, South Korea is a \u201cleading cultural powerhouse in the era of social media and digital culture today,\u201d says Rosalie Kim, the exhibition\u2019s curator, in the museum\u2019s statement. \u201cThis phenomenon has been amplified by tech-savvy and socially conscious global fanbases, further raising the profile and relevance of hallyu around the world.\u201d South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism is sponsoring the exhibition as part of a broader push to promote the country\u2019s arts and creative industries, per the statement. As BBC Culture\u2019s Christine Ro wrote in 2020, the Korean wave has been a \u201cdeliberate tool of soft power\u201d wielded by the government to help revitalize the nation\u2019s economy. \u201cSouth Korea isn\u2019t alone in this; many countries invest in cultural councils and exchanges partly to strengthen diplomatic aims,\u201d wrote Ro. \u201cBut the South Korean government\u2019s push for cultural power has had remarkably quick success.\u201d \u201cHallyu! The Korean Wave\u201d is on view at the Victoria and Albert Museum through June 25, 2023.  Get the latest stories in your inbox every weekday.
