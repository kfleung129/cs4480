To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. By Monica Kim Lee Hi stands 5 feet 1, with round, doll-like cheekbones and a slick of pigment always on her lips. Contained within her demure frame is an enormous voice, raspy yet powerful as it scales up and down experimental beats\u2014one reason why she has emerged as a leading figure in Korea\u2019s rising R&B scene. For years, K-pop has dominated the narrative, but thanks to singers like Lee, who is the costar of a recent documentary about the rise of the genre from Red Bull Sound Select and American R&B artist Gallant, the soundscape is shifting. Her delicate, fine-tuned visuals play no small part in that. Born Lee Ha-yi, the 21-year-old famously came to public attention in 2012, when she was the runner-up on season one of\u00a0K-Pop Star,\u00a0a popular TV program that was Korea\u2019s answer to\u00a0American Idol. \u201cIt was there that my dream of being a singer really awakened,\u201d she says, recalling a childhood spent sifting through her parents\u2019 stockpile of CDs, which included D\u2019Angelo, Maxwell, Brownstone, Erykah Badu, India Arie, and Alicia Keys. \u201cAnd, of course, I admired Michael Jackson and Beyonc\u00e9, the Jackson 5 and Destiny\u2019s Child,\u201d she says. \u201cThen there are artists I listen to now, like H.E.R., Teyana Taylor, SZA, Kehlani, Dvsn\u2014really, a lot of singers still influence me today.\u201d Now Lee is an influencer in her own right\u2014not just in the music industry, but also in beauty\u2014showcasing her makeup skills on Instagram and through collaborations with the likes of MAC, for which she developed a limited-edition shade of deep red lipstick. \u201cI\u2019ve loved beauty since I was young, that wide range of colors and lipsticks\u2014I love playing with lots of color,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter I became a singer, I started to focus on my skin and expressions, too, like the composition and shape of my eyebrows and other delicate details.\u201d A bit of a beauty chameleon, Lee lacks an exact signature look\u2014she\u2019ll easily trade a liquid cat-eye and matte red lip for soft nudes\u2014but there are a few elements she can\u2019t live without. \u201cFilling in your eyebrows with a gel to seal them; a natural curl and mascara on the top and bottom lashes; and contouring powder,\u201d she says. \u201cAs with all things, the base is the most important, so you have to apply foundation meticulously.\u201d In true K-beauty spirit, the rest of her routine is equally pointed and precise: A morning shower, followed by a cotton pad of essence swiped across the face. Then lip balm, hair oil, and a single sweep of a cushion brush from roots to end. After applying cream to her face and letting her hair dry, oil goes on her facade once more. Last but not least, two types of body lotion: one for a quick self-administered acupressure massage, constrained to the neck, back, forearms, legs, feet, and sides; the second, a simple moisturizing cream applied head to toe\u2014and more lip balm for good measure. \u201cIt\u2019s my must-have item,\u201d she says. \u201cIn my clothes, wallet, inside my bag, I carry it around everywhere.\u201d With Lee hard at work on her next album, odds are \u201ceverywhere\u201d will soon include North America, where R&B first originated and where she will no doubt be welcomed with open arms. \u201cK-R&B is indebted to the U.S.,\u201d she says, \u201cbut there is a certain sensibility and feeling that only Korean people have . . . [we] add a unique sensitivity to it\u2014[that\u2019s how] the new genre called K-R&B was born.\u201d By signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.
