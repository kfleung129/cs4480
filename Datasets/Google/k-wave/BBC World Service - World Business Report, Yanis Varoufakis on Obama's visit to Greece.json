    "text": " Whilst meeting the Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras in Athens, President Obama said world leaders need to pay heed to people's very real fears of economic dislocation and inequality in the midst of globalisation. Greece is in what seems like a never-ending financial crisis. It's been relying on emergency loans from other European Union countries and the IMF, since 2010. Athens says that without a cut in its debt, the country will never recover financially. Yanis Varoufakis was the Greek finance minister at the height of the crisis in 2015. He told the BBC's Alex Ritson that President Obama's visit had not filled him with optimism. (Picture: Barack Obama and Alexis Tsipras.
