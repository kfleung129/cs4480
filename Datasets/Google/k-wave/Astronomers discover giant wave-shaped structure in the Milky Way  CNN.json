    "text": "Our solar system resides in one of the Milky Way galaxy\u2019s spiral arms, and for the first time, astronomers have realized we\u2019re close to a giant wave-shaped gaseous structure that connects star nurseries. This wave \u2013 now known as the \u201cRadcliffe Wave\u201d for the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study \u2013 extends in crests that are 500 light-years both above and below the middle of our galaxy\u2019s disk. The long structure stretches for 9,000 light-years total and measure 400 light-years wide. It\u2019s the largest of its kind in our galaxy. The finding was announced Tuesday at the 235th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Honolulu. Researchers from Harvard University analyzed data from the European Space Agency\u2019s Gaia spacecraft, which has been measuring stars since 2013. Gaia\u2019s data was used to create a 3D map of the Milky Way\u2019s matter. It revealed the wave pattern in one of the Milky Way\u2019s spiral arms that is closest to our solar system. \u201cNo astronomer expected that we live next to a giant, wave-like collection of gas \u2013 or that it forms the Local Arm of the Milky Way,\u201d said Alyssa Goodman, the Robert Wheeler Willson professor of applied astronomy at Harvard University and co-director of the Science Program at the Radcliffe Institute of Advanced Study. \u201cWe were completely shocked when we first realized how long and straight the Radcliffe Wave is, looking down on it from above in 3D, but how sinusoidal [defining the shape of a wave] it is when viewed from Earth. The Wave\u2019s very existence is forcing us to rethink our understanding of the Milky Way\u2019s 3D structure.\u201d New image reveals explosive history of Milky Way's center Previously, the nurseries of star formation in this wave-like structure were thought to be part of \u201cGould\u2019s Belt.\u201d This band included regions of star formation thought to be arranged in a kind of ring around the sun. \u201cInstead, what we\u2019ve observed is the largest coherent gas structure we know of in the galaxy, organized not in a ring but in a massive, undulating filament,\u201d said Jo\u00e3o Alves, professor of stellar astrophysics at the University of Vienna and former Radcliffe Fellow. \u201cThe Sun lies only 500 light-years from the Wave at its closest point. It\u2019s been right in front of our eyes all the time, but we couldn\u2019t see it until now.\u201d And as it turns out, we actually interact with this wave. The Milky Way's black hole kicked a star out of our galaxy \u201cWe don\u2019t know what causes this shape but it could be like a ripple in a pond, as if something extraordinarily massive landed in our galaxy,\u201d Alves said. \u201cWhat we do know is that our Sun interacts with this structure. It passed by a festival of supernovae as it crossed Orion 13 million years ago, and in another 13 million years it will cross the structure again, sort of like we are \u2018surfing the wave.\u2019 \u201c The 3D map could just be the beginning for other new discoveries in our galaxy. Although we live in the Milky Way, it can be difficult to study because of gas and dust that obscures the view from our vantage point in the galaxy. This week, NASA shared a new infrared image that cuts through the gas and dust to look in detail at the center of our galaxy. The image reveals more than 600 light-years and allows astronomers to better study the formation of massive stars and the diet of the black hole at the galactic center. The perspective was possible because of the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, or SOFIA, the world\u2019s largest airborne telescope. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to see our galactic center in detail we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d said James Radomski, a Universities Space Research Association scientist at the SOFIA Science Center at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center in California\u2019s Silicon Valley. \u201cStudying this area has been like trying to assemble a puzzle with missing pieces. The SOFIA data fills in some of the holes, putting us significantly closer to having a complete picture.\u201d \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.
