(KOIN) \u2014 Ava has had a decorated tenure\u00a0with Mountain Wave Search and Rescue. But after 10 years and nearly 100 rescue missions, Ava is calling it a career, trading in searches for walks, games and plenty of treats. Becky Irving has been partners with Ava since Ava was 16 weeks old. She said she had two other search and rescue dogs before Ava. She said she had to guide those two during missions. But not for Ava. \u201cI don\u2019t have to help her,\u201d Becky said of Ava. \u201cShe figures it out and gets it done.\u201d And she got it done for years. In 2012, Ava found a missing bow hunter on a snowy day in Ripplebrook. When she found him, his fire had gone out and he was running out of wood. \u201cHe was happy to see a dog come and get him,\u201d Becky said. Ava\u2019s most notable find came just over a year ago. It was typical Ava. A toddler had gone missing in Portland in February, 2017. Ava was the second search dog deployed on that day \u2014 the first had tracked the toddler\u2019s scent, but the trail had gone cold. Ava then took over, figured it out and got it done. \u201cAll of a sudden (Ava) just started dragging me so I\u2019m trying to keep up,\u201d Becky told KOIN 6 News last year. \u201cShe whipped around the corner of the building into this blackberry pile and basically I think she tried to avoid (the toddler) \u2026 As she did that, I looked down and there he was.\u201d The toddler was found hidden in the blackberry bushes. Mountain Wave S&R gave Ava a big steak as a reward. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing way to go out for a dog who\u2019s retiring to have such an incredible find,\u201d Becky recalled. Ava\u2019s work is not done yet, though. She still has to teach her apprentice, Quint, a black Belgian sheepdog. Quint is fast, but could use some of that innate skills that made Ava so good. \u201cHis nickname is Q flash,\u201d Becky said, \u201cand that\u2019s because he\u2019s like a bolt of lightning.\u201d Still, Becky is going to miss Ava as her partner. \u201cI have a bond with this dog,\u201d Becky said, \u201cI don\u2019t have to ask her, she just knows.\u201d Happy retirement Ava! pic.twitter.com/H4g2xP6hx4\u2014 Mountain Wave SAR (@MountainWaveSAR) April 16, 2018 Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc.

Although we\u2019re still several weeks away, Black Friday is approaching fast, so it\u2019s a good idea to get ahead of the curve and check out early deals. Amazon sells nearly every consumer product you can think of. And if you\u2019re looking to save, this is a great time to shop. If you have a Squishmallow fan in your household, act fast\u00a0because there\u2019s a Squishmallow Advent this year that\u2019s going to sell out soon. ",
