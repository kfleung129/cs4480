By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJeff Benjamin After snatching their second No. 2-peaking K-Pop Hot 100 hit with \u201cMr. Chu\u201d in April,\u00a0Apink return with a complex new single. On the surface, \u201cLuv\u201d is a peppy pop track that recalls \u201990s hip-hop production \u2014 think early\u00a0TLC\u00a0and\u00a0Will Smith\u00a0\u2014 but its lyrics speak on longing for a lost lover and reminsicing of the love (or \u201cluv\u201d) once shared.

Despite the glossy production and funky dance breaks, the girls are singing about lost love, rather than their signature cheery lyrics.  Showing a new side of themselves lyrically, Apink\u2019s members remember time spent with their ex-lovers and the safety felt with them while wondering if they reminisce over such feelings as well. Melody-wise, \u201cLuv\u201d has a brightness to it with a hint of melancholy in the girls\u2019 voices.

While main vocalists Eunji and Bomi have almost always handled the choruses, member Chorong\u00a0gets a chance to shine on the final section. K-Pop\u2019s Next Wave: Apink & 9 More Artists to Watch The accompanying video plays more to the sorrowful side of the song as the girls longingly sing to the camera with crystal stickers stuck near their eyelids, looking a bit like tear drops. Like any Apink visual, there\u2019s loads of glam shots and cute dance moves, but it\u2019s all presented with a fall-themed color palette with whites, grays, black and beiges instead of the usual pinks, blues and yellows we\u2019re used to seeing from the band. Mixing a sad subject with a vintage, throwback beat makes \u201cLuv\u201d a rather multidimensional track while showing that Apink can make a few tweaks to their usual formula and still provide the aspects that help them continue to stand out from other acts.
