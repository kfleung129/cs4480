    "text": "LOUISVILLE, KY (WAVE) - The former bookkeeper for St. Gabriel the Archangel Church and school was sentenced on Tuesday to six months home detention and ordered to pay $83,191 in restitution after an embezzlement case. Tammy Goodlett, 49, admitted in court to defrauding St. Gabriel, according to a release from the office of the United States Attorney for the Western District of Kentucky. [PREVIOUS: Federal indictment for embezzlement returned against ex-church bookkeeper] Goodlett was indicted for wire fraud after she transferred funds from St. Gabriel to her personal accounts. Additionally, she used the parish's credit card for personal expenses, including concert tickets, and manipulated financial records to make it appear that she had paid her daughter's tuition at St. Gabriel School. The fraud ran from August 2010 to August 2013. Goodlett has paid $11,757 in restitution and owes the church $71,429.18. The home detention is part of a three year probation term.
