In the music video, the singer is slickly dressed, exuding his tantalizing charisma while flashing hip-thrusting action.  Meanwhile, \u201cLa Song\u201d is a hypnotic, Latin-flavored dance cut that moves Rain away from his typical musical motifs. It\u2019s a bombastic production with a full-on banging beat, trombone-driven melody and a repetitive chorus highlighted by grungy vocals and rapping. The video features Rain in a grimy neighborhood, flaunting his fancy footwork.  Among 10 tracks, all co-written and co-composed by Rain, other notable tracks include woozy club banger \u201cWhere are You Going, Oppa,\u201d featuring HyunA, and a sweet serenade to his beautiful woman, titled \u201cMarilyn Monroe.\u201d The album pours out Rain\u2019s sonic experimental tendencies as well as his oozing pride and confidence as a 13-year K-pop veteran.
