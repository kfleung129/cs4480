By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tTamar Herman Back in 2009, then-13-member Korean group Super Junior became one of that year\u2019s biggest success stories when its single \u201cSorry Sorry\u201d went viral. Over the next few years, the team became one of K-pop\u2019s most prominent performers, and gained an international following around the globe.

Now industry seniors who focus on a variety of entertainment fields, ranging from acting to MCing to\u00a0music video producing, the boy band recently saw a career renaissance with their latest single, \u201cLo Siento.\u201d   A Latin / K-pop collaboration that features Dominican-American singer Leslie Grace and production duo Play-N-Skillz, the group\u2019s April-release showed that Super Junior still has what it takes to lead K-pop\u2019s way\u00a0into new markets: The single went to No. 13 on the Latin Digital Song Sales chart, the first ever Korean song to appear on a Latin music-associated Billboard chart. In an industry where, until recently, careers for idol\u00a0pop acts rarely exceeded a decade, SuJu has once again reasserted their worth as one of the most impactful Korean artists internationally. Super Junior\u2019s career growth has chronologically been in-line with the waxing and waning of K-pop\u2019s popularity globally: \u201cSorry Sorry\u201d was one of several hits in 2009 that spurred new interest in Korean pop culture internationally, fronting\u00a0Hallyu or the Korean wave, in the late \u201800s and early \u201800s. Now\u00a0\u201cLo Siento\u201d comes at a time when more Korean music than ever before is appearing on American\u00a0charts.  \u201cWhen we first debuted, this word \u2018K-pop\u2019 it wasn\u2019t such a big phenomenon as it is now,\u201d group leader Leeteuk (Park Jungsoo) tells\u00a0Billboard\u00a0ahead of their performance at KCON 2018 NY on June 23. \u201cBut when we started to get really popular with \u2018Sorry Sorry,\u2019 K-pop as a whole became such a huge sensation. We want to continue to grow as a group, so that when the public thinks \u2018K-pop,\u2019 Super Junior becomes a household name that is very much relevant to \u2018K-pop.\u2019\u201d  The rise of \u201cDespacito\u201d and other Spanish-language music in the global mainstream made Super Junior and their label, SM Entertainment, believe that the time was right for a Latin pop-inspired track. Performed in Korean, Spanish, and English, \u201cLo Siento\u201d is the most expansive crossover with the Latin world that K-pop has seen as of yet. \u201cBecause it\u2019s something new, there may have been some things that weren\u2019t perfect,\u201d reflects\u00a0Leeteuk. \u201cBut as we try new things, we feel, as a group, that we\u2019ll continue to grow and become a lot stronger.\u201d According to Grace, who performed with Super Junior at the east coast\u00a0KCON event last weekend, \u201cLo Siento\u201d gave her the opportunity to, \u201cLive firsthand the fact that music has no barriers,\u201d and get an eye-witness look at what K-pop and its global audience is like. She performed alongside Super Junior throughout the Latin American stops of their recent Super Show 7 world tour, during which she had her own set midway through each concert.  While talking, it\u2019s clear that Grace and the six members of Super Junior at KCON \u2014 the group\u2019s seventh currently active member Kim Heechul was unable to attend \u2014 have learned much from one another, despite the language barrier; during the interview, barely a sentence gets out of anyone\u2019s mouth without Grace or a member of Super Junior commenting on one another\u2019s response, often poking fun at one another and referencing inside jokes. According to the six, Grace even has a favorite Super Junior song:\u00a0\u201cOne More Chance,\u201d off of last year\u2019s Play album. Co-written by Lee Donghae, the Super Junior member cites her enthusiasm for the song as one of the motivators behind his desire to keep writing music for the group. \u201cThe members really liked this song, Leslie actually says it\u2019s her favorite song as well, and the fans really enjoyed it, so it makes me feel like I need to keep continuing to work really hard and write more, better songs,\u201d Lee explains.   According to Leeteuk, Super Junior feels an obligation as a veteran act to keep pushing forward with their career in new and novel ways, in order not only to remain relevant, but also to continue propelling K-pop\u2019s growth for the next generation of younger K-pop stars. \u201cNot much has changed since our debut days and the debut of current idols,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we look to them, we think that we need to try harder as well, because these kids look to us and think, \u2018Oh, we want to succeed like Super Junior.\u2019 And so in order to keep that, we have to continue to succeed as a group as long as possible.\u201d Though all of Super Junior\u2019s members are well in their early or mid-30s, the group has no plans of slowing down anytime soon.\u00a0\u201cRather than it being a long time for us having been around, we think that there\u2019s even a longer time for us to continue to perform together as a group,\u201d says\u00a0Leeteuk. The idea of moving forward with their career while still maintaining their typical Super Junior style and exuberance radiated\u00a0from the team throughout KCON 2018 NY, where they were the closers of the first night\u2019s concert\u00a0at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey. \u00a0With a set that incorporated a medley of their hits and their newer songs, Super Junior\u2019s six members showed their consummate skill as performers to finish off the show in a high-energy manner that got the whole audience excited. They may no longer be juniors anymore, but as the crowd danced and cheered along to the inspirational lyrics of concert closer \u201cMiracle\u201d \u2014 the ebullient pop track opens with the declaration, \u201cLife couldn\u2019t get better\u201d \u2014 it was apparent\u00a0that the 13-year-old act is very much still one of K-pop\u2019s super stars.
