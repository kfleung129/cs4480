BULACAN, Philippines \u2013 \u201cBest of Best\u201d is a straightforward, but definitely apt title for the recently concluded concert featuring 4 popular K-Pop groups. \u00a0Hallyu, the Korean wave, is a formidable force of global cool, and 4 of its stalwarts arrived on our shores to great anticipation. (READ:\u00a0In Twitter pics: Super Junior, Girls\u2019 Generation in \u2018Best of the Best in PH\u2019 concert) Super Junior and Girls\u2019 Generation (a.k.a. SNSD) are considered veterans of this scene, and were de facto headliners of this concert. Red Velvet and BtoB, though relatively newer than their abovementioned cohorts in the Korean pop music machine, were also much-awaited and have their own contingents of avid followers.\u00a0\u00a0(\u2018Best of the Best PH\u2019 K-Pop concert: 7 things we\u2019re looking forward to) Throngs of youngsters flocked to Manila\u2019s outskirts \u2013 not seeming to mind the distance from their homes. They came to profess their love with screams and banners. Just like that, the whole arena was turned into a deafening wall of sound. The already palpable energy skyrocketed as Girls\u2019 Generation started to perform a set of \u00a0memorable singles spanning their career.        Despite performing as an eight-piece this time around after the controversial departure of member Jessica Jung, songs such as old-time favorites \u201cGenie\u201d and \u201cGee\u201d and the sultry \u201cHoot\u201d were still well-received. The fans sang along in unison as the members danced in hypnotic synchronization. Pumped up by the spirited reception, Super Junior even asked for louder screaming, with Leeteuk trying to compete with incessant shouts of \u201cMabuhay!\u201d They did not perform their whole set as a group though, as Cho Kyuhyun sang solo.      Their signature single \u201cSorry, Sorry\u201d was notably absent from the set, and with the lack of an encore, the crowd departed the venue a tad bit disappointed. Earlier, Red Velvet kicked off the concert with cutesy and saccharine songs such as \u201cIce Cream Cake\u201d and \u201cCandy.\u201d      BtoB, all dressed in black, captivated the crowd with their infectious beats and pop-and-lock dance moves.      Two short and sweet hours might have left the fans wanting, and it\u2019s fair to assume that anticipation for the next one won\u2019t be cooling any time soon. \u2013 Rappler.com All photos by Paolo Abad/Rappler Paolo Abad is a film/television editor and motion graphic designer.
