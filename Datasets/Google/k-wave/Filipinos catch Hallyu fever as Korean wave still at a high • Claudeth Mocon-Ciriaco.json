    "text": "AMBASSADOR of South Korea Han Dong-man considers the growing\nfondness of Filipinos for Korean popular culture, known as hallyu or Korean\nwave, will help strengthen the relationship of his country and the Philippines. \u201cI would like to ask you to continue [the] solid ties\nbetween the Philippines and Korea,\u201d Han said during the 2019 K-pop Friendship\nConcert on March 7 at the SM Mall of Asia Arena. Aside from K-pop, he observed that the local Korean wave has\nstrongly influenced the lives of Filipinos in the form of Korean \u201cnovelas,\u201d\nfood and cosmetics, among many others. The Korean envoy also took notice that the \u201cwave\u201d has\nrapidly spread and continues to make inroads in many places across the country. In his speech before a mammoth crowd of more than 3,000, he\ninsisted that South Korea is still the country\u2019s top source of foreign\ntourists. Han said that in 2017, 1.6 million South Korean visitors\ncame to the Philippines. About 100,000 of them have decided to permanently\nreside here. When it comes to trade, his country maintains its position\nas the Philippines\u2019s fourth-biggest partner, which has contributed $15 billion\nin trade volume. He also extended his gratitude to the Filipinos for the\nfriendship binding their countries, as both will celebrate 70 years of\nbilateral relations between them. The ambassador ended his speech by saying, to the crowd\u2019s\ndelight: \u201cMahal na mahal ko kayo! Mabuhay!\u201d FOR the country\u2019s part, National Archives of the Philippines\nExecutive Director Victorino M. Manalo said his agency would continue\npartnerships with the Korean embassy and the Korean Cultural Center in the\nPhilippines. Newly appointed Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor\nBenjamin Diokno also graced the occasion together with his wife Jo Ann, who\nadmitted to be a K-pop and K-drama fanatic. Meanwhile,\u00a0the embassy\u2019s Ministry of Culture, Sports\nand Tourism First Vice Minister Kim Yong-sam expressed his belief that\nPhilippines is an attractive market to Korean entertainment companies. \u201cProfessionals in the K-pop industry probably found the\ncultural solidarity between the Philippines and [South] Korea very attractive\nand more marketable,\u201d Kim said, as he explained the reason more Korean artists\nare coming to the country, holding concerts and fan meetings. That night, they were entertained by K-pop groups April,\nNoir and NCT Dream. These past years have seen Filipinos welcoming a throng of\nvisiting Korean stars. When 2019 kicked in, K-pop girl groups Momoland and\nBlackpink held respective shows on Philippine shores. In February\u00a0actor Park Hyung-sik held a fan meeting\nafter he was selected as a model for a local clothing brand. Top-tier actor So Ji-sub left fans in awe with his sheer\nrapping skills during his \u201cHello, Manila\u201d fan meet-and-greet on March 16. Park Ji-hoon and Bae Jin-young also met their Pinoy fans\nrecently. Actor Park Bo-gum is set to arrive in April.
