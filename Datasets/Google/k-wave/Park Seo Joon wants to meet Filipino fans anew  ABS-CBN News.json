The 31-year old actor, known for recently starring in the series \"Itaewon Class,\" made the statement in an interview with local lifestyle publication Metro.Style. \"If this situation will be resolved as soon as possible, if there are still people who support me, I hope we can meet up soon,\" Park said in the video, addressing his Filipino fans. \"I'm also hoping for that and I hope you stay healthy until then,\" he added.

When I am in Korea, I don't feel the support that much. But when I went there (Philippines), I had an amazing experience,\" he said.

Aside from \"Itaewon Class,\" Park is notable for starring in the dramas \"She Was Pretty,\" \"Hwarang,\" \"Fight For My Way,\" and \"What's Wrong with Secretary Kim.\" The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted countries to impose travel restrictions and prohibit mass gatherings, leading also to the cancellation and postponement of concerts and fan meets by \"Korean wave\" artists in the Philippines.
