Driven by South Korean entertainment companies seeking fresh markets for their superslick music stars, and lapped up by a Spanish-speaking youth market that adores K-pop\u2019s lavish production values and infallibly upbeat message, a Korean wave is sweeping through Central and South America, attracting large audiences and inspiring cultish devotion. \u201cSo many [K-pop] acts are making South America and Latin America a priority on their touring,\u201d Jeff Benjamin of Billboard\u2019s\u00a0K-Town column told TIME. \u201cThese fans will come out.\u201d Some 13,000 fans showed up at a Super Junior concert in Lima in April; five months previously, Big Bang attracted an audience of 14,000, dancing and singing along to what were surely incomprehensible Korean lyrics to most (albeit with the odd Spanish shout-out or English chorus). There\u2019s a shopping center in the Peruvian capital with entire floors dedicated to South Korean music, cuisine and clothes. On YouTube, K-pop videos with lyrics translated into Spanish notch up millions of views, as fans in Peru and throughout the Hispanophone world log on for their K-pop fix. In other words, South Korean popular music \u201chas reached a certain critical mass and it\u2019s become a niche in and of itself, everywhere,\u201d says Mark Russell, author of Pop Goes Korea: Behind the Revolution in Movies, Music and Internet Culture. (MORE: Seoul Music \u2014 The World Is Finally Ready for K-Pop) That niche \u2014 an amalgamation of spectacular entertainment and relentless optimism \u2014 resonates with teenagers in South American nations. The values these stars represent are almost \u201cConfucian,\u201d says Professor Patrick Messerlin, a French economist who has produced an economic analysis of K-pop and who earlier this year addressed a cultural forum in Seoul on the music\u2019s globalization. In his research, Messerlin found that \u201cK-pop performers deliver a sense of modesty and restraint,\u201d and \u201cinsist on working hard and learning more\u201d during public appearances, something Western pop artists do not do. Their music represents a \u201cnew, colorful and cheerful start,\u201d and not \u201can old order,\u201d something that will easily appeal to millions of young Central and South Americans, living where economic challenges are rife and nondemocratic regimes common. K-pop\u2019s positive energy is a world away from the introspective, jaded and at times downright depressing style of much Anglophone rock, indie and emo. \u201c[The Koreans] say, \u2018We understand your problems,\u2019\u201d Messerlin explains, \u201c\u2018We went through it too,\u2019\u201d referring to the Korean War and the economic crash of the late 1990s.

K-pop songs \u201care beautiful, are decent,\u201d says Jenii Ramirez, an 18-year-old K-pop fan from Colombia, where TV station Caracol has been broadcasting a K-pop talent show and where K-pop concerts in the capital,\u00a0Bogot\u00e1,\u00a0lure audiences of at least 5,000. The singers, Ramirez says, have \u201cdedication and are taught to fight in life, understanding that dreams are attainable.\u201d The timing of K-pop\u2019s Latin push is, of course, no accident.\u00a0From 2008 to 2011, Korean music exports around the world more than doubled, but there is anecdotal evidence that the markets of its traditional East and Southeast Asian heartland are becoming saturated. The M!Countdown Halo Indonesia concert, slated for early July, was canceled because of \u201clocal circumstances.\u201d Another concert in Thailand lost its main sponsor days before the event because of weak ticket sales. The sheer flood of K-pop artists has simply watered down the music\u2019s appeal. Tastes, too, are maturing, with singer-songwriters and alternative bands making inroads into markets traditionally dominated by saccharine pop. In South America, though, decades of conflict, coups and revolution mean that people have had their fill of edginess, authenticity and angst. \u201cIn Chile, we don\u2019t have anything like K-pop. Songs here mostly have political and social relics, though we have Latin rhythm,\u201d a young woman from Santiago, who gathers with friends in a park every week to practice the latest K-pop dance moves, told the South Korean Yonhap News Agency. \u201cThe Korean songs make me dance and smile. What else is needed?\u201d It seems that K-pop\u2019s ability to dazzle is in no danger of diminishing just yet. An earlier version of this article misstated the capital of Colombia. It is Bogot\u00e1, not Santiago. MORE: Trend Alert \u2014 K-pop Meets Country Music and New Jersey ",
