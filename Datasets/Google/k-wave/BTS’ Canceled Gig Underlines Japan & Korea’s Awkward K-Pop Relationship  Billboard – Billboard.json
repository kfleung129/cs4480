Fashion taste aside, what the stories are largely failing to recognize is the ongoing, politically driven tension that has plagued Korean acts in Japan for years, with this being the latest stumble in an already\u00a0awkward relationship.

In the early 2000s, solo diva BoA became the first Korean singer to top the charts in the island nation with her Japanese debut album Listen to My Heart. This paved the way for second-generation K-pop boy bands (like\u00a0TVXQ!, BIGBANG and SHINee) and girl groups (Girls\u2019 Generation and Kara) to hit new heights in the\u00a0market and become regular fixtures on the Japanese media scene \u2014 hitting a new\u00a0jackpot when it came to overseas earnings by the\u00a0early 2010s. Largely, though, many groups (particularly\u00a0TVXQ!) were considered to have worked from the bottom up in the industry rather than riding an already-popular trend.   Still, with an idol scene all its own, Japan had\u00a0seemingly struggled to balance the popularity of Korean artists compared to its domestic acts. In 2011,\u00a0thousands gathered in Tokyo to protest the Korean wave in Japan after an actor said he felt \u201cbrainwashed\u201d by the amount of K-content on a popular TV network and was subsequently fired. By 2013,\u00a0the\u00a0Wall Street Journal was reporting on small but \u201chostile demonstrations against the country\u2019s Korean residents\u201d\u00a0staged every weekend across the country. Around this time, K-pop acts began promoting in Japan less frequently when it appeared that broadcasters had a general sense to slow down on K-pop. It\u2019s only been with the recent success of new-generation leaders like BTS and TWICE that it seemed like the time for K-pop\u2019s Japanese comeback. It\u2019s important to acknowledge that the icy relationship is also largely rooted in long-standing political history. During World War II, the Japanese empire advanced throughout southeast Asia, occupying all of Korea and parts of China. With Japan\u2019s notoriously brutal rule, there is\u00a0still unresolved issues between the Japanese and Koreans over wartime incidents, such as the compensation\u00a0for South Korean women trafficked to Japanese army brothels (known as \u201ccomfort women\u201d) as well as\u00a0Seoul\u2019s refusal to let the \u201cRising Sun\u201d\u00a0flag (a symbol considered to embody the mind-set of the former Japanese empire)\u00a0fly at naval review.  Korea has made a point not to welcome Japanese media as well. After the Japanese rule ended in Korea in 1945, punishment laws and restrictions were enacted to bar\u00a0music, videos, games and more from other countries \u2014 with a major focus on Japan \u2014 which gave South Korea no legal access to Japanese products until the \u201990s.\u00a0Korean radio and TV stations still cannot broadcast Japanese music or dramas even as minor steps to acknowledging the country have come via the popular singing competition\u00a0Produce 48, which saw\u00a0K-pop hopefuls and Japanese idols competing for a spot in a new girl group.  Despite all this, K-pop is still hot in Japan and arguably hitting\u00a0another high. Earlier this week, TVXQ! was announced as the No. 1 touring artist in the country \u2014 beating all Japanese and international artists \u2014 drawing an audience of nearly\u00a01.3 million in 2018, according to\u00a0Japan\u2019s\u00a0Nikkei Entertainment magazine.\u00a0Meanwhile, TVXQ!, SHINee, BTS, TWICE, EXO and\u00a0iKON\u00a0have all hit No. 1\u00a0on Japan\u2019s main Oricon\u00a0Albums Chart just this year alone \u2014 the highest amount of Korean chart-toppers since 2011. Earlier this week, rumors swirled\u00a0in Asian media that BTS and TWICE (who have three members of Japanese descent) would not be invited to Japan\u2019s prestigious and highly rated year-end music festival Kohaku Uta\u00a0Gassen\u00a0despite their success in the market. BTS set a new, first-week record for\u00a0Korean-artist album sales with their\u00a0Face Yourself\u00a0LP, while TWICE scored\u00a0two No. 1s on the Billboard Japan Hot 100 chart. Still, the issue\u00a0was mainly chalked up to the recent tensions over a South Korean supreme court ruling that\u00a0Japan\u2019s\u00a0Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp. needs to compensate\u00a0four\u00a0Koreans for\u00a0forced labor during World War II, a decision Japan denounced, according to Reuters,\u00a0as \u201cunthinkable.\u201d BTS\u2019 T-shirt incident certainly didn\u2019t help matters, but it\u2019s hardly the sole reason for this cancellation among issues that are largely rooted in long-standing political and cultural stances between countries.\u00a0In fact, if it was the only issue, BTS\u2019 previous Japanese television appearances (including a December 2017 performance on Japan Music Station Super Live) would have logically been canceled too. To those watching the situation for longer than BTS\u2019 rise to prominence, it is yet another slip in an ongoing awkwardly tense situation where culture and politics far outweigh a fashion item.
