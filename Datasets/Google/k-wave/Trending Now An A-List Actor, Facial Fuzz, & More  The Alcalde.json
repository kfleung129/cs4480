Put him in Gregory Gym and you get full-on fan pandemonium. As of presstime, the star of The Notebook was filming an untitled Terrence Malick film in Austin, popping up on South Congress, the Drag, and yes, even on campus\u2014much to the delight of Longhorns.\u00a0 Catching a glimpse of Gosling has become somewhat of a campus-wide obsession. Website the Digital Texan even created a guide to his favorite Austin haunts for those feeling a bit stalker-ish. (Hole in the Wall and Guero\u2019s Taco Bar are on the list.) \u201cI\u2019ve been faking a British accent since I got to college.\u201d Thanks to a new free iPhone app, Whisper, Longhorns are sharing their deepest secrets\u2014from the innocuous to the raunchy\u2014anonymously with others on the Forty Acres. The app features confessions posted within a mile of the center of campus, and lucky for students with something to get off their chests, it doesn\u2019t track or store data about its users. Popular \u201cwhisper\u201d topics include relationships, spirituality, and self-esteem. The mustache trend is growing\u2014bad pun intended. Whether it\u2019s a handlebar or pencil, it seems there\u2019s a lingering love of facial hair on campus following \u201cMovember,\u201d an event each November where men grow mustaches to raise awareness for men\u2019s health. And this trend isn\u2019t limited to men: mustaches can be found on jewelry, clothing, and more at various retailers. Gangnam Style, anyone? The catchy dance-pop single by artist Psy of South Korea has garnered more than 8 million views on YouTube and inspired many students to break out some crazy dance steps, including Psy\u2019s go-to move: riding an imaginary horse. The Internet sensation\u2014which inspired many a Sixth Street-costume on Halloween\u2014is one of several Korean pop, or K-pop, hits to make it big this side of the Pacific, a phenomenon now known as the \u201cKorean wave.\u201d Top, photo by Brenda Avila.
