Jo Lawson-Tancred, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 11, 2022 With no shortage of world class museums, London usually boasts a good roster of unmissable exhibitions. For the art crowds that flock to the U.K. for Frieze Week, the city is putting its best foot forward with a bumper offering of Modern and contemporary art exhibitions. Fairgoers who need a break the frenzied bustle and want to see more of what London has to offer outside of Regent\u2019s Park and pop-up tents will no doubt feel spoilt for choice. Here is a round-up of nine of London\u2019s must-see museum shows this week.  \u201cCarolee Schneemann: Body Politics\u201d installation view at the Barbican Art Gallery, 2022. Photo: Lia Toby/Getty Images. The first U.K. survey of radical American artist Carolee Schneemann, who died in 2019, introduces a whole new audience to her transgressive feminist practice. The Barbican Art Gallery has ample space to house more than 300 objects, including large-scale installations, that give a comprehensive overview of just how varied Schneemann\u2019s output of films, paintings, assemblages, performances, scrapbooks and costumes was over her 60-year career. As the title promises, visitors will learn how Schneemann\u2019s body was often her most enduring medium in a series of works that still serve today as bold challenges to a male-dominated art world. \u201cCarolee Schneemann: Body Politics\u201d, Barbican Centre, Silk Street, EC2Y 8DS.

This exploration of South Korea\u2019s vast and multifaceted international cultural influence takes its name from the 1990s phenomenon of \u201challyu\u201d, or \u201cKorean wave,\u201d which refers to the global popularity of Korean culture. An overview of the country\u2019s modern history leads us from war through military rule and into an era of rapid industrialization. With objects ranging from a 1980s sculpture by the video art pioneer Nam June Paik right through to many viral sensations from very recent memory, including K-Pop superstars, the hit Netflix drama Squid Game and Bong Joon-Ho\u2019s Oscar-winning film Parasite, the exhibition proves that this mania shows little sign of slowing down. \u201cHallyu!

For her first solo exhibition in London, the Sudanese artist Kamala Ibrahim Ishag, now in her 80s, returns to a city that has been woven into her practice since the start. The most historic works on show date back to the 1960s, when Ishag was a student at the Royal College of Art, while other objects relate to a period of self-exile in London during the 1990s and 2000s. Sudanese life, history, spiritualism and culture are the primary themes running through her art, specifically as those subjects relate to the experiences of women. Among the newest pieces are two paintings, Bait Al-Mal (2019) and Blues for the Martyrs (2022), which both reflect on the devastating loses of the Khartoum Massacre on June 3, 2019. \u201cKamala Ibrahim Ishag: States of Oneness,\u201d Serpentine South Gallery, Kensington Gardens, W2 3XA.

The latest artist to take on the Turbine Hall at Tate Modern, one of London\u2019s hottest annual commissions, is the Chilean artist and poet Cecilia Vicu\u00f1a. Using the same ancient Andean-influenced methods, her works range in scale from the tiny sculptures that make up the Precarios\u00a0series to her vast textile installations, including Quipu Womb, an exploration of feminine energies which was recently acquired by the Tate. This latest commission,\u00a0Brain Forest Quipu, uses found objects like plant fibre, rope, cardboard and wool to reflect on the destruction of the rainforest both as a driver of the climate crisis and as an act of violence against indigenous communities. \u201cHyundai Commission: Cecilia Vicu\u00f1a,\u201d Tate Modern, Bankside, SE1 9TG.

In another of many firsts for London this week, the Slovakian abstract sculptor Maria Bartuszov\u00e1 receives her first substantial exhibition in the UK, just coinciding with the inclusion of her work in the \u201cMilk of Dreams\u201d curated exhibition at the 59th Venice Biennale. Giving a sense of the breadth of her exploration into sensual, suggestive and organic forms, more than 80 plaster works have been staged beside bronze casts and aluminum reliefs. The show also sheds light on how Bartuszov\u00e1\u2019s life was affected by totalitarianism and the Cold War, crucial context that highlights the considerable struggles that she overcame to establish herself as a pioneering woman on the international art scene. \u201cMaria Bartuszov\u00e1,\u201d Tate Modern, Bankside, SE1 9TG.

In celebration of the centenary of the birth of one of the greatest 20th-century British artists, the National Gallery has brought together more than 65 of his best known works from the 1940s up to the 2000s, including portraits of his children, various lovers, the financier Jacob Rothschild, artist David Hockney, performer Leigh Bowery and Queen Elizabeth II. The location is especially apt because Freud had a special pass to enter the National Gallery during closing hours, sometimes even visiting in the night, and many of his historical influences, including Holbein, Rubens and Vel\u00e1zquez, can be found just a short walk away. \u201cThe Credit Suisse Exhibition\u2014Lucian Freud: New Perspectives,\u201d National Gallery, Trafalgar Square, WC2N 5DN.  Still from Christopher Kulendran Thomas\u2019s film The Finesse (2022). A new film, The Finesse, produced in collaboration with Annika Kuhlmann, is the centerpiece of Christopher Kulendran Thomas\u2019 solo show at the ICA, a variation of which is also running at the KW Institute for Contemporary Art in Berlin. Existing across multiple screens and a projection, the work takes us back to the early years of the internet, when the Tamil Liberation movement set up an alternative, cooperative global economy during the Sri Lankan Civil War. By combining archival footage with A.I.-generated avatars, the show prompts us to imagine radical alternative uses for technology in the present day. \u201cChristopher Kulendran Thomas: Another World,\u201d ICA London, The Mall, SW1Y 5AH.

A new immersive installation by Zadie Xa continues the artists long time interest in her country of heritage, Korea. Housed within a traditional \u201chanok\u201d architectural structure, a range of sculptures, paintings and textiles revive many of the traditional Korean legends, ideologies and Buddhist shamanic practices that were left behind during the country\u2019s rapid industrialization of recent decades. Among the highlights are the \u201cAnimal Guide\u201d marionettes, including tigers, foxes and seagulls, who each have their own spiritual and cultural resonances. \u201cZadie Xa: House, Gods, Animal Guides and Five Ways 2 Forgiveness,\u201d Whitechapel Gallery, 77-82 Whitechapel High Street, E1 7QX.

The huge impact of Surrealism on art is well known, from Dal\u00ed\u2019s clocks to Max Ernst\u2019s experiments with frottage, but although the Surrealists were very interested in creating uncanny objects, their influences on design remain an area that has been under-explored. In a major new survey, the Design Museum brings together examples of interiors, fashion, film and photography\u2014including the work of fashion photographer Tim Walker, design Christian Dior and musician Bj\u00f6rk\u2014to show how the same preoccupations with dreams, the absurd, subversion, and desire have tantalized and amused creatives throughout generations. \u201cObjects of Desire: Surrealism and Design 1924\u2013Today,\u201d Design Museum, 224-238 Kensington High Street, W8 6AG.
