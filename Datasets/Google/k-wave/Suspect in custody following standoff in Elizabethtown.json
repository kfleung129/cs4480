    "text": "ELIZABETHTOWN, KY (WAVE) \u2013 A suspect who prompted a standoff involving Kentucky State Police was taken into custody. After more than four hours, a K-9 officer bit the suspect, Robert May, in a tree line behind a home he was believed to have broken into. Trooper Jeff Gregory, the spokesman for the Elizabethtown post, said the situation began after an undercover trooper witnessed an accident involving a stolen vehicle. KSP said the stolen vehicle, driven by May, hit another vehicle, then hit a house and reportedly caused a gas leak around 2 p.m. Monday. As troopers pulled up to the scene Gregory said the vehicle that hit the home fled. The trooper got out of his vehicle to check on the woman in the vehicle May wrecked into and she reported she was not injured. After checking on her the trooper began to chase after the fleeing vehicle. With troopers in pursuit, May abandoned the vehicle and fled on foot through a field. According to a police report, he then went into the garage of a home in the 100 block of Evergreen Trail, in the Cedars subdivision. The owner of the home confronted May and he told the homeowner he needed a glass of water. The homeowner told May to leave at which time the report said he tried to steal a van inside the garage, but was unable to find the keys. The report said May was then removed from the vehicle by the homeowner and he told the homeowner he was going inside the home. The resident tried to flee and got into a struggle with May. The homeowner sustained a torn earlobe, which required stitches, but was able to escape. For hours KSP believed May was still inside the home and Gregory said troopers established a perimeter around the house and shut down the subdivision. With assistance from the KSP K-9 unit troopers eventually located him near a creek bed in the tree line behind the home. May was taken into custody and charged with burglary. Prior to Monday, May's most recent charge was on Aug. 15, 2014 for theft by unlawful taking.
