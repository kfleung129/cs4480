    "text": "BETA Oct 24, 2018 \u2022 2 min read  BTS is, undoubtedly, the biggest group in the world right now, conquering one nation after the other with their irresistible K-pop beat and incredible choreographies. The group is currently busy with its world tour, which has just completed its North American and European dates, but even if the seven members of BTS are far from home they never forget their home country, South Korea, or its capital. And that\u2019s exactly why they want you to come and visit the many wonders Seoul has to offer. The seven Billboard-winning artists are Seoul\u2019s Honorary Tourism Ambassadors, and their latest campaign in collaboration with Visit Seoul (the city\u2019s official tourism agency) has just been released. With the title \u201cLive Seoul like I Do,\u201d it aims to show tourists, fans and everyone in between BTS\u2019 favourite spots around the city. BTS are musicians, so it makes perfect sense that the way they\u2019re showing what they love about Seoul is a playlist\u2014 each member has his own Seoul playlist centred around a particular theme, all presented as video commercials which are already trending all over YouTube. RM, the group\u2019s leader, shows you around \u201cExtreme Seoul,\u201d like Mount Bukhansan, a favorite destination for climbers; Jin explains all the activities lovers of \u201cHistoric Seoul\u201d can do, like watching traditional martial arts; Suga is in charge of \u201cFashionable Seoul,\u201d which brings visitors right in the middle of the city\u2019s shopping districts; J Hope stays on brand with his \u201cK-Wave Seoul\u201d playlist, which shows you how you can learn to dance like a K-pop star and where to find the best K-pop goods. Jimin helps you discover \u201cRelaxing Seoul,\u201d for example by kayaking at sunset on Hangang river; V opens the doors of \u201cExclusive Seoul,\u201d where you can have your own custom-made traditional Korean clothing; and finally, the group\u2019s youngest member Jungkook takes charge of everyone\u2019s favourite part of a trip, food, with his \u201cDelicious Seoul\u201d playlist. And since BTS are so well-known around the world, there\u2019s also a competition\u00a0designed exclusively for people outside of South Korea\u00a0\u2013 if you complete your own Seoul playlist, you can get a chance to win a three-night stay in the city, and visit it following one of the boys\u2019 personalised routes. If you\u2019d like to see more campaign content or enter the competition, you can do so by visiting the official website here.
