    "text": "greek firm k-studio takes advantage of wood\u2019s versatile nature to build the barbouni restaurant on the beach of costa navarino, greece. the structure begins with heavy timber log piers and columns laid out on a regular grid that support an elevated platform, allowing the ocean to seep underneath during high tide. back along the brush, the covered spaces nestle against the land, including the kitchen, storage, and bathroom areas.\u00a0 clad in vertical wooden louvers, the enclosed spaces continue the repetitive rhythm of material as seen throughout the building. the public seating area exists in an open floor area on the ocean side of the structure.\u00a0  image \u00a9 yiorgos kordakis (also main image) | all images courtesy of k-studio   piers protrude into robust columns along the perimeter of the footprint supporting a floating open timber canopy where a series of hanging fabric sheets forms a fluid three-dimensional roofscape that sways freely with the breeze. these create a sense of form in the ceiling and help to filter direct sunlight into the dining space below, allowing only flickering moments of fleeting rays to reach the hardwood floor below. the kinetic nature of the ground (water) and ceiling create an ideal and natural environment in between for a social culinary experience.  side elevation from the public approach image \u00a9 yiorgos kordakis image \u00a9 yiorgos kordakis ceiling fabric are hung on tensile members stretching across the outer frame image \u00a9 yiorgos kordakis entrance, with kitchen on the left and restrooms to the right image \u00a9 yiorgos kordakis filteres light reaches the ground image \u00a9 yiorgos kordakis open seating area enjoys vies of the ocean image \u00a9 yiorgos kordakis image \u00a9 yiorgos kordakis image \u00a9 yiorgos kordakis image \u00a9 yiorgos kordakis ceiling view image \u00a9 yiorgos kordakis image \u00a9 yiorgos kordakis hanging lights utilize the same material as the structure image \u00a9 yiorgos kordakis image \u00a9 yiorgos kordakis view from the land image \u00a9 yiorgos kordakis floor plan / level 0   project info:   name: barbouni location: pylos, costa navarino, greece designed by: k-studio photographer: yiorgos kordakis status: completed a diverse digital database that acts as a valuable guide in gaining insight and information about a product directly from the manufacturer, and serves as a rich reference point in developing a project or scheme.
