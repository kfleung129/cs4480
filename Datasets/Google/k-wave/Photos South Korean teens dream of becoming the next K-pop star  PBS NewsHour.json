Up by 7:30 a.m. for school, followed by hours of voice training lessons, piano lessons, dance lessons and a private English tutor session, she is on a determined path to K-pop stardom. And in South Korea, Kim is not alone. DEF Dance Skool in Seoul, where Kim takes her dance classes, is just one of thousands of schools in the country that nurture the next generation of K-pop stars. In 2013, DEF had approximately 1,000 students, half of whom are trying to break into the top agencies. Kim Si-yoon, center, takes part in a dance class at DEF Dance Skool in Seoul Nov. 11, 2014. Photo by Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters A recent survey of pre-teens in South Korea showed that 21 percent of kids wanted to be K-pop stars like Psy when they grow up \u2014 making it the most popular career choice. In college, pop music is one of the most coveted majors. Korean pop culture, often dubbed Hallyu (Korean word for \u201cKorean Wave\u201d) has been around since the late 1990s, born with popular TV dramas, reality shows and the music industry that constantly produces boy bands and girl groups who have been hits across much of South East Asia. In the past few years, reality shows looking for the next K-pop stars have been the craze, usually starring top judges from the \u201cBig Three\u201d talent management companies. Reuters photographer Kim Hong-Ji followed the aspiring wannabe 9-year-old, as well as a popular girl group named \u201cGfriend\u201d as they prepare and perform a big show.
