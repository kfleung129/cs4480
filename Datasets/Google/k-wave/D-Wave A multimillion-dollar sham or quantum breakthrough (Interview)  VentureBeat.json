    "text": "Canadian startup D-Wave\u00a0is so far ahead of the rest of us that employees refer to IBM\u2019s Watson \u2014 and the rest of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers \u2014 as \u201cclassical.\u201d That\u2019s because D-Wave is the first and so far only commercial quantum-computing company. It\u2019s also one of the most controversial companies in existence, with many scientists skeptical that D-Wave\u2019s computer architecture really pulls off quantum computation. D-Wave\u2019s senior executives paid me a visit at the VentureBeat offices. Don\u2019t miss the full interview below. Some of the leading experts have publicly denounced D-Wave as a classical computer dressed up by its research team to appear to be far more impressive than it actually is.\u00a0Anthony Leggett, a physicist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a Nobel laureate in physics, is one of many high-profile critics who have voiced concern. D-Wave has made claims that \u201chave not been generally regarded as substantiated in the community,\u201d he told\u00a0IEEE Spectrum\u00a0in 2009. Founder Dr. Geordie Rose\u00a0unveiled D-Wave\u2019s first proof-of-concept processor in 2007 at a high-profile event at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif. As a science journalist for\u00a0Nature recalls, this company seemed to come out of nowhere, and most of the academic world thought it was crazy. Classical computers run in binary 1s and 0s, but a quantum computer is comprised of quantum bits or \u201cqubits,\u201d which can carry far more information.\u00a0D-Wave hopes that this new computing dynamic will give us the capability to determine a variety of possible solutions simultaneously and save energy by speeding up the computing process by many orders of magnitude. The founders have dedicated the past year trying to solidify its claims. But the critics continue to raise concerns after D-Wave raised $30 million in October 2012\u00a0from the CIA, Amazon founder\u00a0Jeff Bezos, and other investors \u2014 or when the company sold a quantum computer to Lockheed Martin for $10 million in March. Most impressive of all, in May, Google and NASA announced plans to boot up a quantum computer at NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif. To mark the announcement, Google released a short video explaining what quantum computing actually is. To watch it, skip to the bottom of this post. Also in May, a company in Ontario, Canada utterly dismissed D-Wave by claiming to be on the brink of a scientific breakthrough that is \u201cbigger than the moon landing.\u201d Executive-in-residence of the Institute of Quantum Computing Rob Crow told us\u00a0that\u00a0\u201cwe are trying to be the first to build the quantum computer.\u201d Last month, D-Wave\u2019s chief executive Vern Brownell and chief scientist Eric Ladizinsky visited to discuss how quantum computing could some of the world\u2019s thorniest computing problems.\u00a0Here are excerpts from that interview. VentureBeat: What is quantum computing? Vern Brownell:\u00a0Quantum computing uses the laws of quantum mechanics to directly do a computation. The promise of quantum computing is that it can speed up classical algorithms. We use the term \u201cclassic\u201d to refer to virtually everything in the world today \u2014 these are all classical computers as they are not using quantum mechanics. There are problems that could take all the time in the universe and you still couldn\u2019t solve them \u2014 but you could with a quantum computer. We are at the dawn of the quantum-computing industry right now. VentureBeat: You\u2019ve had a long career in technology and finance. What inspired you to join D-Wave? Brownell: I joined D-Wave four-and-a-half years ago after running technology for Goldman Sachs and working in various engineering management roles. I believed then, and certainly now, that this technology is going to change the world at a faster rate. It\u2019s incredibly complicated and a huge opportunity. I also recognize that there is some controversy around quantum computing. But we are off to a great start with customers like Google and Lockheed Martin. When I joined the company, I thought, \u201cThis is a big swing \u2014 it\u2019s either a crater or the best thing to happen to computing in 20 years.\u201d Now, I\u2019m far more confident. We are proven that this quantum computer exists. This is a tremendous opportunity for our investors and corporate partners. VentureBeat: How does the technology actually work? Brownell: The system at its lowest level is a semiconductor chip. It runs at these very low temperatures. It needs to tap into that quantum mechanical effects. A shielding surrounds the machine that is the size of a fingernail. Eric Ladizinsky:\u00a0This is not another supercomputer. It\u2019s akin to discovering fire or electricity. The quantum computers use physical phenomenon that seems like magic. The same physical object can live out many possibilities. Here\u2019s an example I use: Imagine you\u2019re at the Library of Congress and surrounded by 50 million books. I put an X in one of those books. Go and find the X. It would be near impossible if you were to look at one book sequentially. You would be acting classically. That is the way that processors work today. The trick is to talk to all of those shelves at once, and have one of those shelves raise its hand when it recognizes the X. VentureBeat: What types of problems will we solve with a quantum computer? Ladizinsky: We can solve very hard problems \u2014 those problems that scale exponentially with a number of variables. Genomic matching is a good example \u2014 you have to take a genome and match it against a certain pattern. It can be done by a quantum computer much faster than a classical computer. For financial services, we could use the computer to value risk and look at what could happen to the firm\u2019s portfolio or balance sheet. We are really in this for the types of problems we can solve; we are trying to move science forward. There are so many problems that are beyond the capability of classical computers today. VentureBeat: What\u2019s the go-to-market strategy? Brownell:\u00a0We don\u2019t intend on giving exclusivity to any company for this machine. Our philosophy as we build the business is that we\u2019re partnering with large companies initially to develop the technology. For instance, we are working with Google on machine learning applications. With Lockheed Martin, we\u2019re doing software verification. We are looking for the leaders in teach of the spaces that we\u2019re working in. We\u2019ll develop joint intellectual property and then open it up to everyone else.
