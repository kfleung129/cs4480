Actress Song Hye Kyo is a living witness who has walked the same path as Korean dramas, which are a central part of Hallyu.\u00a0At the same time\u00a0Korean dramas swept through Japan and China, Song Hye Kyo became recognized overseas for various dramas ranging from KBS2\u2019s \u201cAutumn in My Heart\u201d in 2000 to tvN\u2019s \u201cEncounter\u201d that ended earlier this year. It is partly due to the steady creation of quality content that \u201cK-dramas\u201d emerged as a brand in itself, but the stellar actors played a central role in its rise. The term Hallyu came to be, and Song Hye Kyo was one of the first actors to be included in it.\u00a0In fact, Song Hye Kyo proudly topped the K-drama category in the \u201cHallyu Diagnosis, We Asked 100 Experts\u201d survey conducted by Sports Seoul last month. When asked about how she\u2019s doing recently, the actress answered, \u201cI\u2019ve been meeting up with people I couldn\u2019t meet when I was busy shooting a drama, and I\u2019m\u00a0resting while going on vacation. I\u2019m also reviewing offers for my next project.\u201d Asked about what the title \u201cHallyu star\u201d meant to her, she replied, \u201cI think it serves to promote a new image and culture of Korea. It is a proud title that can also be a heavy burden.\u201d Song Hye Kyo is well-known for promoting Korea overseas.\u00a0She has been contributing guidebooks to\u00a0Korean independence movement sites overseas\u00a0like Shanghai with Professor Seo Kyung Duk and donated 10,000 copies of Korean and Chinese guidebooks to the Hangzhou Temporary Government Memorial Museum to mark the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the Provisional Government of Korea. She is also focusing\u00a0her efforts on providing Korean language services to world-famous museums including the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Museum of Toronto. Song Hye Kyo mentioned her interest in language and history while talking about how she changed\u00a0through Hallyu. She\u00a0said, \u201cMy interest in language has grown. While communicating with overseas fans, I thought that the first thing they needed was a language [that could be mutually understood], and I\u2019m\u00a0continuing to do my best to learn [languages]. My interest in history has increased as well. As I have been working overseas, I feel a lot of responsibility as a Korean actor.\u00a0I am making various efforts to convey our history and culture.\u201d There\u00a0were times when Song Hye Kyo was moved by the enthusiastic response from fans.\u00a0she said,\u00a0\u201cI feel honored and grateful that people of various nationalities love me and my work. That\u2019s also my driving force.\u201d Then she added,\u00a0\u201cI was surprised to learn later that overseas fans were\u00a0doing volunteer work together\u00a0as \u2018Song Hye Kyo\u2019s fans\u2019 and making joint donations. I\u2019m so grateful, and\u00a0it remains a\u00a0memory I\u2019m very proud of.\u201d When asked about her expectations about the future growth of Hallyu, the actress stated, \u201cIt would be important to make various\u00a0new points of contact based on a cultural understanding of each other. I think we can expand\u00a0Hallyu through active exchanges, such as working with local production companies and artists.\u201d Song Hye Kyo\u00a0has also engaged in activities in China.\u00a0She participated in Chinese films such as \u201cThe Grandmaster\u201d (2013) and \u201cLove and Let Love\u201d (2017) and attended the Hong Kong Gold Merit Film Awards as an award presenter this year.
