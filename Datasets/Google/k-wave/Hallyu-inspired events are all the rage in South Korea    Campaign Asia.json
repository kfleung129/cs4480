    "text": "Korea Tourism Organization uses its cultural influence to draw in events. About 10 years ago, at the cusp of the global reach of Korean dramas, Korea Tourism Organization (KTO) realised the value of its hallyu offerings. The term refers to the \u2018Korean wave\u2019 driven by pop culture and entertainment. These days, hallyu is not limited to pop culture but encompasses a lifestyle around fashion, make-up, and social media. It\u2019s become a \u2018way of life\u2019 or something to aspire to for fans of the movement. While KTO has matured its hallyu marketing over the years, the meetings and events market is catching up. The Korea Mice Bureau\u2014an events arms under KTO\u2014recently launched a support program to incorporate hallyu in corporate meetings and incentives. The program was rolled out in August. Under the program, delegates can choose from various hallyu offerings including attractions (K-pop dance school, SM Entertaintment Museum, etc), merchandise and opt for K-pop entertainment. This will serve as additions to the standard stock of offerings such as welcome ceremonies at the airport, gala receptions, and traditional Korean souvenirs. \u201cEver since we've updated our support system which highlights hallyu content, we're constantly receiving inquiries regarding K-pop performances or hallyu experiences,\u201d said Chulbeom Park, director of the corporate & incentive team for KTO. For instance, a large incentive group from Indonesia arriving this month requested for a K-pop performance at their gala dinner. Indonesia is cited as a \u2018rapid growth\u2019 market for hallyu according to the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency\u2019s annual hallyu index. the fanchant for sorry sorry is so crazy. the song that started the hallyu wave in Indonesia \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc99 #AsianGameswithSJ pic.twitter.com/rCiV9dvzYr On top of that, KTO recently won a bid to host a general assembly for a multinational direct sales company in 2019. One of the biggest factors that drew the decision was the exclusive K-pop performance included in the new support program. \u201cBy utilising hallyu, not only can we differentiate Korea from other countries but we are also able to show Korea's charm as a destination for corporate meetings or incentive travel,\u201d said Park. \u201cIt is unique cultural content that is from Korea alone.\u201d In June, KTO appointed South Korean boy band, SHINee as the \u2018Korea MICE Honorary Ambassador\u2019 to draw in fans from Southeast Asia and China \u2013 the two main markets for South Korea. On top of that, roadshows were held in the region to show off film locations used in popular Korean dramas. \u201cHallyu is already popular with people all over the world. But countries that have more access to hallyu content such as Southeast Asia, Japan and China are more responsive to this campaign,\u201d said Park.
