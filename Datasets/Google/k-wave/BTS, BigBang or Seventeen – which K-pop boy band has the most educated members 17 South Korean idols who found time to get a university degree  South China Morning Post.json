    "text": "Everyone knows education is important, whatever career path one wants to take. Even in the world of K-pop, getting a solid schooling is a big deal, with Korean entertainment companies actively encouraging idols-in-training to get ahead academically as well as artistically \u2013 whether as a security net, or simply for personal growth and fulfilment. As a career in the entertainment industry isn\u2019t as stable as a day job, most idols climb up the academic ladder after graduating from high school, whether by taking up short courses and language classes to attending scholarships and pursuing doctorates. Which just begs the question \u2013 which K-pop stars are the smartest, most-educated, and who found time to get a degree while reaching for superstardom? BTS BTS is well known for advocating education, and encourages its \u201cArmy\u201d of fans to stay in school and learn new things. Do the boys they practice what they preach? Graduating with a major in film studies from Seoul\u2019s Konkuk University in 2017, Jin is currently attending Hanyang Cyber University for graduate studies.

Meanwhile maknae (youngest member) Jungkook is now attending Global Cyber University for broadcasting and entertainment like his hyungs. Nu\u2019est\u2019s and Seventeen\u2019s 95-line It was announced earlier this year by Hanyang University that Nu\u2019est\u2019s JR, Minhyun, Baekho and Ren have enrolled as freshmen, alongside their hoobaes S.Coups and Jeonghan of Seventeen, in the university\u2019s Institute for Future Talents. The labelmates will be taking up the institute\u2019s practical music course in the K-pop division. BigBang Aside from their hit songs and outstanding K-pop legacy, some BigBang members take pride in their educational attainments. Taeyang held a Bachelor\u2019s degree in theatre and film before receiving his Master\u2019s degree in producing performances and images in 2016 at Daejin University. He also wrote a thesis titled \u201cThe Influence of BigBang\u2019s 2015 World Tour on the Sustainability of the Korean Wave\u201d, which is available online through the National Library of Korea. Members T.O.P and G-Dragon also both have Master\u2019s degrees, in theatre and film from Dankook University and retail and distribution from Sejong University, respectively. Girl\u2019s Day\u2019s Sojin Girl\u2019s Day\u2019s Sojin clearly has a practical mind, completing her degree in mechanical engineering from Yeungnam University. The group\u2019s leader and lead vocalist initially faced a backlash about her acceptance into the university, however she soon proved that she deserved her place. During her college years, she was one of eight women in her major consisting of 1,000 students.
