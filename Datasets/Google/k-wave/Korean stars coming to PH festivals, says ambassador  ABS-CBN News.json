South Korean Ambassador to the Philippines Han Dong-man bared on Thursday plans to bring Korean artists to local festivals in an effort to strengthen cultural ties between the country and South Korea. \"We have many plans in local areas. You have wonderful festivals,\" Han said in a press conference at the Mall of Asia Arena for the 2019 K-POP Friendship Concert in Manila. \"We will combine your local festivals with also K-pop... bringing Korean artists in the local areas,\" said Han. The K-POP Friendship Concert in Manila is among activities lined up this year in celebration of the 70th anniversary of bilateral relations between the Philippines and South Korea. Relations between the two countries began after the Philippines provided military assistance to South Korea during its war with North Korea in 1949. An orchestra concert in June will be held to honor Korean War veterans, the ambassador said, mentioning former president Fidel Ramos, who fought in the Korean War. The Philippine government will likewise hold events in Korea such as exhibits on Philippine mythological creatures, said National Archives of the Philippines Executive Director Victorino Mapa Manalo. \"We hope to develop with them a kind of cultural gain,\" Manalo said.
