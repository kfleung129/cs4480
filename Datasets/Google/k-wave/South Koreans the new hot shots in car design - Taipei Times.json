    "text": "In today\u2019s auto industry, where famed Japanese quality and durability are increasingly a given, design is king and, among designers, South Koreans are hot property. From General Motors\u2019 (GM) bold Chevrolet Camaro to the quintessential British gentlemen\u2019s Bentley, more top models carry the flair and signature of a group of designers from South Korea, which some have dubbed \u201cAsia\u2019s Italy\u201d for its impact on car design, fashion and aesthetics. As competition in the industry becomes ever more cutthroat, partly as gaps in quality and technology narrow, automakers need bolder, edgier designs to differentiate. From a global talent pool, South Koreans stand out. Photo: Reuters Designers, including Sangyup Lee, Jinwon Kim and Jay Jongwon Kim, are gaining influence at automakers in the US and Europe, and even at Toyota Motor, as well as, of course, at Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors. Theories for this South Korean wave vary: from Hyundai\u2019s rise and the nation\u2019s work ethic, to a societal emphasis on external beauty \u2014 South Korea has a thriving cosmetic surgery industry \u2014 and the impact of a 1990s comic book and TV series called Asphalt Man, which starred local heartthrob Lee Byung-hun as a young car designer. The aspiring fictional designer inspired \u201ca lot of kids, including me, at the time,\u201d said Sangyup Lee, who is in charge of exterior design and advanced design at Bentley\u2019s main studio in Crewe in northwest England. Photo: Reuters Four years ago, Sangyup Lee led a South Korean-Russian-Brazilian team that redesigned the new Camaro for launch by GM in 2009. He later moved to Volkswagen and then to the German group\u2019s Bentley unit. Another member of the Camaro team was Steve Kim, a South Korean who is a director at GM\u2019s design studio in Seoul. The two used to work in the basement of Sangyup Lee\u2019s house in a Detroit suburb, often late into the night tossing around ideas and filling up sketchpads to conjure up the new Camaro. \u2018KOREAN MAFIA\u2019 At GM, the Detroit automaker that bought failed Daewoo Motors in 2002, close to three dozen South Koreans are among several hundred professionals working at the main US studio in Warren, Michigan \u2014 and are dubbed the \u201cKorean mafia\u201d or \u201cK-team.\u201d Tim Lee, GM\u2019s global manufacturing chief and China unit chairman, says most global brands are now equally capable on quality and technology. \u201cWhat sets us apart? Great design and [economies of] scale,\u201d he said, adding that a successful automaker has to offer more car for the customer at affordable prices. At Toyota, Jinwon Kim led the design of the FJ-Cruiser, an edgy sport utility vehicle. Mercedes-Benz designer Hubert Lee, US-born but who grew up in Seoul, masterminded the styling of the CLS luxury coupe, and Jay Jongwon Kim is a rising talent at Opel, one of the design brains behind the Monza concept car that won plaudits at this year\u2019s Frankfurt auto show. \u201cKoreans are extremely good designers, well trained and disciplined,\u201d said Chris Bangle, a former BMW design chief who now runs a design consultancy in Italy. Bumsuk Lim, a South Korean professor of car design at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California \u2014 widely regarded as the Harvard of auto design \u2014 says the rise of South Korean designers is a result of a turn in the global industry. \u201cIn most mature markets people have moved on and cars are generally nothing more than a means of transportation,\u201d he said. \u201cIn [South] Korea and, increasingly, China, people still dream of owning cars and they\u2019re considered a status symbol,\u201d making car design a desirable profession. In a typical class of 12 to 15 students at the Art Center, more than half are Asians, and half of those are South Koreans, said Bumsuk Lim, who previously worked at GM and Honda Motor. GM\u2019s Steve Kim said that economic power shifts mean the next wave of designers is likely to emerge from China and Southeast Asia. A trailblazer for today\u2019s Korean design talent was John Chun, a Korean War veteran who in the late-1960s designed Shelby Cobras, tricked-out performance variants of the Ford Mustang. Chun, who was also a consultant to Hyundai and worked for Tonka Toys, died in July, aged 84. A couple of decades later, Art Center\u2019s Lim and Bentley\u2019s Lee came of age, paving the way for the current generation of Korean designers, though Bangle, the ex-BMW design chief, said the world is still waiting for South Korea to produce the likes of Japan\u2019s Ken Okuyama, who designed the Ferrari Enzo, and Shiro Nakamura, Nissan Motor\u2019s chief designer. Beyond an innate design talent, South Koreans\u2019 success owes much to the nation\u2019s famed work ethic and tenacity, Bangle said, recalling how Jay Jongwon Kim, an industrial design student, turned up unannounced at BMW\u2019s Munich studio one day in 2006. With no appointment, Jay Jongwon Kim paid his own way to Germany armed only with the address of BMW\u2019s headquarters, a portfolio of designs and a hunger to succeed. Once he had located the design studio, he had to beg reluctant receptionists to call a designer whose name he had found on the Internet. The student, who barely spoke English, let alone German, was eventually allowed in and gave the first of half a dozen presentations that day, first at the MINI studio and then at the main BMW studio to Bangle and current BMW design chief Adrian Van Hooydonk. Six months later, Kim was back at BMW, this time with an appointment, to present to Bangle a scaled-down model of a design he had shown earlier. He gave a dazzling presentation, complete with lights and music, and was offered an internship on the spot. That led to a formal job offer seven months later, which was scuppered by the 2008 global financial crisis. Undeterred, Kim secured a position at Mercedes-Benz\u2019s studio in Yokohama and later moved to GM\u2019s Opel, where his work on the Monza concept hints at the design language for Opel\u2019s next generation of cars. A key member of GM\u2019s \u201cKorean mafia\u201d in Michigan is Christine Park, who was lead interior designer for the Cadillac XTS full-size sedan launched last year to help revive the storied brand. Park, now Cadillac\u2019s lead exterior designer, says the success of her compatriots coincides with the rise of South Korea\u2019s fashion and architectural industries as the economy has prospered. She says her parents and grandparents are part of Korea\u2019s lost generation for whom life was a tough slog through Japanese occupation, World War II and the Korean War. \u201cThey had to worry about whether they had enough to eat day to day,\u201d said Park, a South Korean who was educated in California. Parents wanted their children to become lawyers, doctors or engineers, she added. \u201cNow, art is very much celebrated,\u201d making car design a more desirable career choice, she said. \u2018CAR CULTURE\u2019 Bentley\u2019s Lee said South Koreans are also playing catch-up with developed car markets as they lacked a \u201ccar culture.\u201d The 44-year-old said that, unlike some of his peers today, his family did not have \u201ca big garage full of hot-rod cars.\u201d Similarly, Kim at Opel, the son of a rice miller, said he rarely saw cars on the streets of Buan when he was growing up. From the age of 12, Sangyup Lee attended \u201cart cram school\u201d in the evenings in Seoul, determined to gain entry to Hongik University, a leading art school. He went on to study sculpture at Hongik and then car design at Art Center, before joining GM in 1999 after a stint at Porsche and Pininfarina, an independent Italian design studio. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a strong automotive tradition in Korea, so most of us are very hungry and willing to work hard\u201d to gain the knowledge and expertise in car design, Lee said. \u201cThat makes us flexible and versatile.\u201d The biggest challenge for South Korean designers now is consistency, moving from one-off hits to developing a lasting legacy that is \u201cthe definition of good designers,\u201d Patrick le Quement, Renault\u2019s design chief who retired in 2009 after 22 years, said in an e-mail exchange. \u201cDesign is like F1 racing, it\u2019s good to win a race, but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll become world champion. There are drivers who made a habit of winning and those that won occasionally, for lack of talent, concentration and dedication,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very impressed by the overall quality of young [South] Korean designers. Consistency is the sign of real talent,\u201d he said. NOT ALL BAD:\n                                        Nvidia is still Morgan Stanley\u2019s top pick in the semiconductor sector, and 95 of analysts have a buy-equivalent rating on the company                                        Investors who snapped up shares of Nvidia Corp at the bottom of last month\u2019s swoon were given a harsh reminder of the multiple forces pushing and pulling on the chipmaker\u2019s business prospects.\r\nWhat looked like a prescient bet last month \u2014 the stock surged 14 percent over 15 trading days \u2014 turned sour last week as shares tumbled on new US chip rules on China, a move that threatens a chunk of the one-fifth of Nvidia\u2019s revenue that came from that country last quarter.\r\nIt was another harsh reminder for Nvidia fans that for all the hype around its position as a \u2018URGENT ORDERS\u2019:\n                                        C.C. Wei said that while inventory control might be healthier than expected, it is unclear whether the recovery would be a \u2018sharp rebound\u2019                                        Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC, \u53f0\u7a4d\u96fb) yesterday said that revenue this quarter would expand about 11 percent sequentially, supported by strong demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and 3-nanometer chips.\r\nTSMC has seen nascent signs of stabilizing demand for computers and smartphones in the past few months, which has helped drive down customer inventories to healthy levels this quarter and heralds \u201chealthier growth\u201d for next year, it said.\r\n\u201cWe are receiving some urgent purchase orders asking for more chips to meet demand,\u201d TSMC chief executive officer C.C. Wei (\u9b4f\u54f2\u5bb6) told investors. \u201cThat gave us a hint that inventory control has already become healthier Nvidia Corp is using Arm Holdings PLC technology to develop chips that would challenge Intel Corp processors in PCs, ratcheting up competition between the two semiconductor makers, people familiar with the situation said.\r\nNvidia, whose artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator chips already dominate that market, is attempting to make central processing units (CPUs) for PCs, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.\r\nThe CPUs would support Microsoft Corp\u2019s Windows operating system and go on sale as soon as 2025.\r\nIntel\u2019s main rival in PCs, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD), is also working on Arm-based processors, according to The US yesterday unveiled a list of 31 technology hubs that it is to create as part of the vast investment scheme that US President Joe Biden hopes will help him win re-election.\r\nUS Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said that the centers would create jobs and boost national security and the economy.\r\nThe investments \u201cfurther underpin our ability to compete, and frankly, outcompete the rest of the world,\u201d she said.\r\nThe hubs were chosen from among 400 candidates and would compete for grants of as much as US$75 million.\r\nThey were created under the CHIPS and Science Act, a law passed last year ",
