Asia Times Covering geo-political news and current affairs across Asia Asia Times\u2019 Managing Editor Patrick Dunne thought he had escaped the continent when he flew to Calgary, Canada, on a family visit last week \u2013 only to find his eight-year-old daughter Amara singing in a language he did not recognize. \u201cI thought she was speaking in tongues,\u201d Dunne recalled. \u201cThen I realized she was repeating lyrics from the K-pop song \u2018Likey\u2019 by Twice.\u201d His daughter told him that at school, she and her friends occupy much of their free time doing K-pop dance moves. \u201cYes,\u201d Dunne mused. \u201cK-pop has made it to Canada.\u201d Indeed. For decades, K-pop and its wider trend, hallyu (\u201cThe Korean Wave\u201d \u2013\u00a0 comprising music, TV dramas and film) flooded across Southeast Asia, East Asia and parts of the Middle East and Latin American. However, the saccharine charms of perfectly choreographed pretty-boy and pretty-girl bands were largely resisted by Western audiences, even though the phenomenon was widely reported. Artists with apparent breakthrough potential, such as Rain (\u201cBi\u201d), Girls Generation and the Wonder Girls never quite made it in London or New York, while quirky ironist Psy \u2013 who was, anyway, a virtual anti-K-pop artist \u2013 proved to be a one-hit wonder overseas with the now-immortal \u201cGangnam Style.\u201d Now, however, the K-wave has \u2013 finally \u2013 crashed upon Western shores. With a vengeance. Spearheading the tsunami is BTS \u2013 the boy band whose collective faces are almost as globally recognizable as Kim Jong Un\u2019s. According to the\u00a0International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, the organization which represents the recording sector worldwide, BTS was the number-two global artist in 2018 behind Drake. Ticketmaster voted their four-continent world tour \u2013 which sold out both London\u2019s Wembley and California\u2019s Rose Ball \u2013 the hottest concert ticket of the year, while Spotify named them 2018\u2019s second-most streamed artists. \u00a0They even addressed the United Nations. \u201c2018 was the breakout year that BTS became the Asian-version of Beatlemania,\u201d said Bernie Cho, president of Korean music artist and label services agency DFSB Kollective. \u201cIt\u2019s been a bit surreal to see a K-Pop band like BTS neck-and-neck on international music charts with the likes of Drake, Lady Gaga and Queen. It\u2019s hard to believe that BTS concert tickets are now more expensive than Elton John, Taylor Swift, and The Eagles.\u201d How did BTS do it? Everyone has an opinion.

Mark Russell, the author of \u201cK-Pop Now,\u201d suggests BTS arrived in a market that was just maturing. \u201cAny time a new genre is rising, it is a series of steps to grow the fanbase and develop the connections,\u2019 he said. \u201cA lot of people nibbled at it \u2013 you had the Wonder Girls and Girls Generation \u2013 it is a whole process of growing any market.\u201d Others cite musicality and the heartfelt messaging behind BTS\u2019s songs. \u201cI am 63 and I am a fan \u2013 I am going to their concert because I really sympathize with what they are saying when they are singing,\u201d gushed Choi Jungwha, head of the Corea Image Communication Institute, or CICI. \u201cTheir songs are what I feel \u2013 their sincerity!\u201d While all K-pop acts have leveraged social media \u2013 most notably by using YouTube as a distribution mechanism to cross borders while building a visual as well as aural brand \u2013 BTS have deployed weapons-grade social media skills to connect with their millions of fans, the BTS \u201cArmy.\u201d \u201cThey show their daily lives on vlog so there is no barrier \u2013 it is as if we are friends or family,\u201d Choi said. \u201cBTS have all these \u2018Army\u2019 members who translate into many languages every aspect of their daily lives, which is shared on social media. Other bands did not do that.\u201d Production values are stratospheric. \u201cWhen you see their vlog \u2013 aesthetically it is so well done, so beautiful, it is almost perfection,\u201d Choi said. But why did other K-idol bands not break through before? After all, multiple BTS selling points \u2013 pinpoint dance choreography, hyper stylish threads, flawless complexions and cutesy good looks \u2013 were typical of their predecessors. One commentator, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of his comments, suggested that the K-poppers who came prior were too carefully curated by the Seoul-based entertainment agencies that incubate talent using a factory-style training process, and usually supply groups with songs and music. \u201cThe Wonder Girls and Rain did not write their own music and their life experiences were all about being trainees [in the hands of the management companies which mold the stars], so though they made great music, when they were thrust into an interview situation, they had nothing to talk about,\u201d the source said. \u201cFans actually want humans: K-pop acts came across as too robotic and over rehearsed\u00a0\u2026 they are so trained, it is hard for them to be natural and normal.\u201d BTS, however, are actual singer-songwriters. \u201cMaybe people were waiting for someone like The Beatles who wrote their own songs and built their own brand,\u201d said Park Ye-seul, who operated Seoul\u2019s K-Pop Academy, an experience center, in 2018. \u201cThe runaway success of BTS is in many ways, a rebellious proof of concept that K-Pop needs to evolve beyond the \u2018pretty boy-band\u2019 stereotype,\u201d said Cho. \u201cBTS Army fans around the world are very loud and very proud of the fact the band members are not management manufactured idols but actually socially aware, outspoken artists.\u201d That presents a challenge\u00a0to other K-popsters. \u201cJust looking good is not good enough, fans and critics want more,\u201d Cho added. \u201cIdols, for better and not for worse, now have to be \u2018artists.\u2019\u201d K-pop, with its multiple cultural influences and high-tech distribution and marketing, may be poised as a global cultural norm for the 21st century. \u201cK-pop is a global cultural appropriation machine that takes in other cultures\u2019 systems and turns them into new things, with no allegiance to the original,\u201d said Michael Hurt, a visual sociologist and research professor at the University of Seoul. \u201cIt if sounds good, who the hell cares where it came from? If you want to mix rap, jazz, RnB and rock it does not matter \u2013 it is a hyper-modernity kind of thing.\u201d The combination of BTS\u2019 staggering success and the maturing market for K-pop means that other Korean acts are also capturing bridgeheads in Western markets. Just days after BTS announced their sell-out world tour, the debut mini-album by fellow label members TXT (\u201cTomorrow by Together\u201d) topped the iTunes Top Album charts in 49 countries, including Australia, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden and the US. This year, one of the biggest music festivals in the world, California\u2019s Coachella, will be headlined by Korean girl group Blackpink. And K-music extends beyond idols; Blackpink will be joined at Coachella by two other Korean acts. One is Jamba Nai \u2013 an experimental, punky-looking alternative rock band that wields Korean traditional instruments. The other is Hyukoh \u2013 an indie rock band that sings in Korean, English and Chinese. According to Cho, Korea is the world\u2019s biggest market for \u201cindie music\u201d \u2013 not a genre, but a descriptor of artists not represented by the big three global labels, Sony, Universal and Warner. The market is pioneering creative new sales concepts. For example, Korea, once known as a market where digital music had killed physical sales, has now reverted. In 2018, BTS were the first Korean act ever nominated for a Grammy in the \u201cBest Recording Package\u201d category. Their fanatical Army don\u2019t just buy digital music, but CDs too \u2013 which are so well designed, they become collectors\u2019 items. \u201cAlthough the CD packaging design was impressive, CD sales were even more impressive,\u201d said Cho.\u00a0\u201cLast year, BTS collectively sold over 600,000 CDs in the US \u2013 second only to Eminem, who amassed over 750,000 CD sales. What\u2019s more impressive is that BTS sold over 1.4 million CDs in Korea in just one week \u2013 nearly the same amount the best-selling CD in the USA sold in an entire year.\u201d And there are other revenue streams. For decades Korean products, from smartphones to cosmetics, have been promoted across Asia by K-pop idols in commercial endorsements. The emergence of K-pop stars in Western markets suggests lucrative new brand-to-band commercial ties. Kia Motors is sponsoring Blackpink, Hyundai Motor are in bed with BTS. And of course, Brand Korea scores collateral benefits. \u201cK-pop is a gateway drug to Koreana in general,\u201d said Hurt. K-drama and K-pop music videos \u201care very influential in introducing people to other layers of the K-cake,\u201d he added. Thanks to K-pop, the K-fashion, K-cosmetics, K-cuisine and K-tourism sectors have all benefited. But not every fan is ultra-engaged. Back in snowy Calgary, Amara Dunne has not analyzed K-pop too heavily. \u201dI saw some friends working on dance moves and wanted to try it too,\u201d the eight-year-old said of the lure of K-pop. \u201cIt\u2019s cool!\u201d 1 Comment I do not even understand how I stopped up here, but I assumed this submit was good. I don\u2019t understand who you\u2019re however definitely you\u2019re going to a well-known blogger if you happen to are not already \ud83d\ude09 Cheers! You must be logged in to post a comment.
