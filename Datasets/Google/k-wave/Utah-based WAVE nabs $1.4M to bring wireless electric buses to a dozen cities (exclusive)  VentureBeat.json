Learn More  If batteries weren\u2019t so expensive, most cities would have invested in electric buses by now. Batteries are also notoriously heavy, and slow to recharge. But a new startup called WAVE has developed a wireless transfer system that can be used by by bus manufacturers to operate electric buses with vastly reduced battery sizes. WAVE, which is one of Utah\u2019s hottest startups, is powering the state\u2019s first wireless electric bus. The research was conducted at Utah State University (USU), and is now being commercialized, after a successful on-campus test run. The company exclusively told VentureBeat that it raised a $1.4 million round of venture funding to bring WAVE to more cities across the country. To date, it has raised roughly $7.8 million, a sum that also includes city contracts. The funding for the initial research came from a federal grant, and USU holds an equity stake in the company. WAVE\u2019s technology works by transferring power through the air. Charging pads are embedded in the road, which removes the need for on board power storage. Wireless electric transfer is not new, but only in recent years has the technology developed to the point where it can be used for urban transportation. As WAVE\u2019s chief scientist Hunter Wu explains in the video below, the company uses \u201chigh frequency magnetic fields to jump through an air gap and transfer large amounts of electric power.\u201d At the VCIR Fall conference in Park City, I met with the team behind WAVE. The founders are already in the market for further investment. They are currently in talks with a number of city transit authorities, including New York, Seattle, and Monterey. The company\u2019s cofounder and head of sales Wesley\u00a0Smith expects that wireless electric buses will be implemented in about 10 more cities by the end of 2014. Smith told me that it\u2019s a far cheaper and more environmentally friendly option. Diesel buses are cheap to acquire, but expensive to operate, with diesel prices at $3 per gallon. Meanwhile, electric power is selling at 12 cents a kilowatt hour, which roughly equals $0.65 per gallon. Cities can choose to equip a new bus with WAVE\u2019s technology, or convert a retired city bus. \u201cThat\u2019s the most sincere form of reuse and recycle,\u201d said\u00a0Mike Masquelier, the company\u2019s chief executive, in an interview. \u201cThese buses won\u2019t end up in a landfill somewhere.\u201d Kickstart, a Utah-based seed fund, led the most recent investment in WAVE.\u00a0Clarke Miyasaka, who works for Kickstart, was one of the first people to ride in one of WAVE\u2019s wireless electric buses. He told me that the experience isn\u2019t any different to a typical bus ride, except it\u2019s \u201cfar quieter.\u201d Kevin Jessing, who works at\u00a0Utah Governor\u2019s Office, added the technology has been vetted, and he\u2019s confident it\u2019s \u201csafe for passengers.\u201d For this reason, WAVE\u2019s team is confident that they won\u2019t experience pushback from city regulators. In the future, WAVE plans to partner with companies making electric delivery trucks, and enter that highly lucrative market. The company is also rapidly hiring, and is moving into a larger facility in Salt Lake City.
