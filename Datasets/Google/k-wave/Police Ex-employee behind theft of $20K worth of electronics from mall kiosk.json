    "text": "LOUISVILLE, KY (WAVE) - A Louisville man is accused of participating in the theft of $20,000 worth of electronics and accessories from a retail kiosk at Mall St. Matthews. According to an arrest warrant, Jaquez D. Robinson, 18, and two co-defendants accessed a Sprint kiosk at the mall at 6 a.m. on February 26, 2015. Police said one of the Robinson's accomplices had been fired from the business the previous day. [SLIDESHOW: Mugshot Roundup - March 2015] The warrant states that the former Sprint employee was able to use his thumbprint to access a safe in the kiosk because his profile had not been removed from the store's computer system. He was able to remove the cabinet keys from the safe. Police said that after the cabinet doors were unlocked, the trio took 29 phones, tablets and accessories worth approximately $20,000 and left the mall without paying for the items. The incident was captured on surveillance video. Sprint employees recognized their former co-worker from the video. He was questioned by police and told them Robinson was also involved. Robinson is charged with theft by unlawful taking. Copyright 2015 WAVE 3 News. All rights reserved. ",
