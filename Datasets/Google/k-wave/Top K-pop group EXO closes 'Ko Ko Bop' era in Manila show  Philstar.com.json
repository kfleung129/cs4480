EXO was back in town as the headliner of South Korean music program MBC Show Champion in Manila last Sunday, only few days away before its highly-anticipated comeback on November 2. Last April, the boys of EXO were in the country for their concert \u201cElyXiOn.\u201d  Members Xiumin, Suho, Baekhyun, Chen, Chanyeol, D.O., Kai and Sehun sent fans cheering loudly and waving their lightsticks and banners passionately the moment the K-pop stars took the stage. EXO performed tracks from its fourth studio album \u201cThe War\u201d and repackaged album \u201cThe Power of Music,\u201d which were both released in 2017. Filipino EXO-Ls were in for a treat as they witnessed the group\u2019s 70th performance of its hit song \u201cKo Ko Bop.\u201d The reggae and EDM hybrid track has always been EXO\u2019s staple in every performance since its release last year.  EXO also staged the equally-impressive B-side tracks \u201cWhat U Do\u201d and \u201cBoomerang,\u201d which showcased the group\u2019s outstanding vocal abilities. The night would not be complete without the group\u2019s performance of \u201cPower\u201d\u2014a song about how music brings people together. But as the fans bid farewell to the The War-The Power of Music era, they are more than ready to welcome a new one.
