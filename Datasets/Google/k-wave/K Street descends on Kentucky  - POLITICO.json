Washington lobbyists, many of them former McConnell aides, were packed in among members of his current Hill staff and local volunteers at a Best Western meeting room Saturday morning to hear \u201cthe boss,\u201d as many still call him, whether they still work for him or not. \u201cA lot of what you see is the \u2018Mc-family,\u201d\u2019 said Hunter Bates, a former McConnell chief of staff who is a co-founder of Republic Consulting, a boutique lobbying firm with offices in Kentucky and Washington. ( Also on POLITICO: GOP gains steam) \u201cIt\u2019s the extended McConnell family all coming together at crunch time both to do everything that we can to help, but also to celebrate what we believe will be his biggest and greatest victory in his career.\u201d McConnell, hoping to be the next majority leader if Republicans take the Senate, is in the final stretch of a tight race against Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes. Cutting checks won\u2019t help him now, but volunteers on the ground can \u2014 knocking on doors to get out the vote. It\u2019s become a veritable ritual: When leaders of either party find themselves in tight races, friends on the Hill and K Street parachute into a state with which they may have no other connection to help get voters to the polls. So while McConnell is making his closing argument to voters, including that he\u2019s a Kentuckian through and through, he\u2019s counting on Washington storming the Bluegrass State to get him across the finish line. ( POLITICO\u2019s polling center) \u201cAt headquarters we\u2019ve gradually run out of things to do. We\u2019ve raised all the money we can raise. We\u2019ve bought out all the TV time we can buy and radio time and dropped all the mailing pieces we can,\u201d McConnell told the crowd Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s all in your hands.\u201d The mass of McConnell supporters in the state this weekend spanned the gamut from his chief of staff, Sharon Soderstrom, to at least one former member of his security detail. Nearly all of McConnell\u2019s current staff is here for the final push, including policy adviser and counsel Brendan Dunn and senior policy adviser Neil Chatterjee. Former McConnell staffers-turned-lobbyists and consultants are also out in force. Among the dozens who have traveled to Kentucky for the election are David Schiappa, former parliamentarian and floor manager for the Senate GOP, of the bipartisan lobbying firm the Duberstein Group; Megan Hauck, former McConnell health policy adviser, who co-founded the boutique firm Nathanson+Hauck; and Lanier Swann Hodgson, who handled conservative third party and business outreach for McConnell and now is director of state and federal affairs for UNC Health Care. ( POLITICO\u2019s 2014 race ratings) Despite holding the rally at the \u201cWorst Western,\u201d a nickname many have given it for its lack of amenities, like working showers, the event has an almost family reunion-like feeling as volunteers fresh off their flights shake hands and hug others who\u2019ve been here for weeks. Gone are the suits and ties and pearls. Those mainstays of the inside-the-Beltway Republican wardrobe have been replaced by \u201cTeam Mitch\u201d T-shirts, jeans, sneakers and fleece jackets as they prep for a day of door knocking and attending chilly McConnell campaign events. \u201cA lot of us have done it for every campaign,\u201d said Jon Deuser, a former McConnell staffer and lobbyist at the Smith-Free Group, a small bipartisan lobbying firm. Deuser, who served as a driver to McConnell and later as a legislative aide, recalled how there were just six or seven D.C. staffers when he first volunteered on his 1990 reelection campaign. \u201cIt seems to have gotten bigger each time because the races have gotten bigger as he\u2019s grown in seniority and up the leadership ladder,\u201d Deuser said. Over his nearly 40-year career, McConnell has had close races before, including his 2008 race against Bruce Lunsford in which there was a similar \u201call hands on deck\u201d call through the Kentucky Republican\u2019s extended network. The feeling of a mini-Washington also comes from McConnell\u2019s own campaign staff. His personal office chief of staff Josh Holmes stepped down from that position last August to focus exclusively on the GOP leader\u2019s reelection. More recently McConnell spokesman John Ashbrook decamped for Kentucky this fall to help with the campaign\u2019s messaging. Former McConnell chiefs of staff, including Bates; Billy Piper of Republican lobbying firm Fierce, Isakowitz & Blalock; and Kyle Simmons of the recently formed Simmons & Russell Group have also been informally advising senior campaign staff like Holmes with regular calls. Follow @politico  \u201cIt\u2019s an all-hands-on-deck moment, and there\u2019s just a lot of enthusiasm behind it,\u201d said Steven Law, a former McConnell staffer who is a board member of the pro-McConnell super PAC Kentuckians for Strong Leadership. \u201cOne thing that you consistently hear from former McConnell staffers is how proud they are to have worked for him and the personal affection they have for him. People want to show up.\u201d In a political environment where incumbents are regularly pilloried for their ties to Washington and lobbyists, McConnell was unapologetic for the wave of out-of-state supporters coming in to help him at the end. \u201cI\u2019m just grateful for the help,\u201d McConnell said after a rally with Kentucky Republican Rep. Andy Barr in Mount Sterling. \u201cI think this is a national race with a lot of interest from people not only inside the state but around the country.\u201d Further, McConnell pushed back against his opponent, Grimes, for criticizing out-of-state United Mine Workers of America members coming to support him. \u201cI think she shouldn\u2019t demonize the UMWA people coming from Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio,\u201d McConnell said. And heading out on the campaign trail is hardly a Republican-only phenomenon. Democrats also have a history of flying across the country to help their former bosses, particularly when top party officials like former Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota and current Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada were in trouble. Daschle lost his 2004 reelection bid while Reid was able to fend off Republican Sharron Angle in 2010. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things that you work for the person because you believe in them and so with that when they are in for a tough reelection you want to do everything you can to make sure they get reelected,\u201d said Penny Lee, a former senior adviser to Reid, who volunteered during his last campaign. \u201cI have done everything from knock on doors to stuff envelopes to write thank-you notes. \u2026 It\u2019s not necessarily the intellectual exercise that they need. They just need bodies.\u201d While his campaign believes McConnell will win, it isn\u2019t leaving anything to chance. A NBC/Marist poll out Sunday showed McConnell beating Grimes, 50 percent to 41 percent. For weeks D.C.-based McConnell volunteers have flown in to help staff campaign events, canvass and door knock in an unprecedented effort to beat Grimes. The jobs aren\u2019t glamorous \u2014 most would spend this chilly weekend door knocking in key counties. The McConnell operation dedicated significant resources to design a sophisticated GOTV app that volunteers have downloaded to their phones. Others have helped bolster the crowds for McConnell\u2019s seemingly endless series of campaign stops around the state. Malloy McDaniel of Blank Rome Government Relations helped organize a \u201cBluegrass Blitz\u201d that coincided with McConnell\u2019s coal bus tour. Downtowners like Justin Rzepka and Michael Dean of NCTA, Frank Cavaliere of Microsoft, Bill Bailey of the Walt Disney Co., Keith Murphy of Viacom and Myriah Jordan of Facebook all sported \u201cTeam Mitch\u201d T-shirts as they smiled for an Instagram photo while in the state supporting McConnell. Over the past several weeks, others, like former McConnell chief of staff Piper, have been a near omnipresence on the campaign, traveling with McConnell on his coal bus tour, which focused heavily on Eastern Kentucky. \u201cAfter working for him for almost 20 years, it was literally coming home again,\u201d Piper said. \u201cIt\u2019s so invigorating because it reminds you why you are trying to do what you are doing in Washington.\u201d Follow @politico  Link Copied \u00a9 2023 POLITICO LLC ",
