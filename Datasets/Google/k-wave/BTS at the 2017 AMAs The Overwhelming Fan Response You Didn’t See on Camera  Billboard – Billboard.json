    "text": "BTS fan reactions from inside the 2017 American Music Awards at Microsoft Theater show how K-pop listeners are not only embracing the music and its stars, but Korean culture at large. By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJeff Benjamin BTS\u2018 history-making performance of \u201cDNA\u201d at the 2017 American Music Awards dazzled everyone from Jared Leto and The Chainsmokers to the millions of viewers at home,\u00a0but this\u00a0important mainstream-music moment also stood out for what\u00a0happened in the audience \u2014 specifically,\u00a0with their loudest fans.

And when it came to supporting the guys at the AMAs, they did everything to make sure the guys felt right at home, including a\u00a0K-pop performance tradition.  While it may not have been\u00a0audible to viewers watching through television or streams, the moment the opening notes of \u201cDNA\u201d began,\u00a0Los Angeles\u2019\u00a0Microsoft Theater was flooded\u00a0with fans screaming out the band members\u2019 names. This was the beginning of what is known as a \u201cfan chant,\u201d which\u00a0fans in Korea use as a way to actively support their favorite artists\u2019 performances on television and in concerts. Typically, the louder the fan chant, the more popular the act is and it helps\u00a0audiences at home get a sense of what acts they should be watching. Read the Translated Lyrics to BTS\u2019 \u2018DNA\u2019 Here While U.S. audiences have possibly seen\u00a0this sort of chanting during\u00a0K-pop concerts here or festivities like KCON, BTS\u2019 ARMY was in full force on Sunday night,\u00a0supporting the band with their loudest chants\u00a0yet. Take a look at some fan-shot footage here: I\u2019ve been to a lot of concerts and award shows but never in my life have I experienced anything like this: @bts.bighitofficial killed it last night \u2014 @mrgeorgealiaga A post shared by Samantha Alaimo (@samantha_alaimo) on Nov 20, 2017 at 11:25am PST Watching the video, quickly, you\u2019ll hear the theater filled with spectators rhythmically\u00a0hollering the band members\u2019 full names (\u201cKim Namjoon! Kim Seokjin! Min Yoongi!\u201d), and emphasizing key phrases from the song both in English (\u201cThis love! Real love!\u201d) and Korean with strict precision. Fans know when to chant, when\u00a0to scream and when to be quiet; essentially changing the definition of what many Westerners would consider as appropriate audience participation.  There are set lyrics for fans to chant (sometimes created by the record label, sometimes crafted by the fans), and a quick YouTube search will get you all caught up on when and what to shout for K-pop artists\u2019 lead singles and any other songs they perform on TV.  Not only was BTS\u2019 performance of\u00a0their Korean-language hit on a major-network award show an\u00a0indication of K-pop\u2019s palpable crossover in America, but also how Korean culture at large is also making its way here. Fans are not only embracing the music and its stars, but the aspects that make the entertainment business specifically Korean. While\u00a0audience screams for boy bands like One Direction, *NSYNC and Backstreet Boys were likely also ear-splitting, the unique way in which BTS\u2019 fans supported them on such a huge television broadcast showed a deeper\u00a0connection and respect with the band\u2019s culture. These fans clearly watch the guys\u2019 domestic performances and\u00a0see the way Korean\u00a0fans\u00a0support, recognizing that\u00a0BTS see this as a way to connect with fans on stage. With this action, it\u2019s clear the U.S. fans wanted\u00a0to make the guys feel just as supported in this foreign country. While there has been talk for years\u00a0about the \u201cKorean wave\u201d hitting stateside \u2014 and its impact can certainly be felt in the beauty and food world \u2014\u00a0the country\u2019s most famous export in K-pop seems like it will undoubtedly be most the significant (and certainly the loudest)\u00a0way for broader aspects of Korean culture to make an impact in America. ARMY is a clear example of this, but as BTS\u2019 star rises here, it will be important to see the other ways they are influencing their passionate fans.
