By \n\n\tLee Hyo-won SEOUL \u2013 A digitally remastered version of Oldboy will be released in South Korean theaters on Nov. 21, exactly 10 years after its original release in 2003. Under the auspices of its director,\u00a0Park Chan-wook, the film\u2019s visuals have been revamped with color correction and elimination of scratches and dust. The editing and audios remain the same.  Q&A:\u00a0Korea\u2019s Park Chan-wook on Making His Hollywood Debut \u2018Stoker\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s very old, as it was made during the analog age. It was a pity to see dusty, streaked prints being screened all over the world. I\u2019ve wanted to make a digital version for a long time,\u201d Park was quoted as telling Yonhap News.  Considered a crown jewel of Korean New Wave cinema, Oldboy won the Grand Prix at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival with high praise from jury head Quentin Tarantino, and it helped establish Park\u2019s reputation in the international film scene. Spike Lee is helming the U.S. remake of Oldboy. Based on a Japanese graphic novel, it is the second installment in Park\u2019s Vengeance Trilogy. It is about a middle-aged man who is held captive inside a motel room, oblivious of the reasons why. When released 15 years later, he embarks on a vengeful quest for his captor\u2019s motives.
