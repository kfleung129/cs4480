    "text": "Discover Thomson Reuters By Reuters Staff 3 Min Read SEOUL (Reuters) - In the early hours of a freezing Christmas Eve, 62-year-old Lee Myeong-sook queues up in Seoul\u2019s ritzy Gangnam area for a chance to buy a t-shirt, or maybe even a toothbrush, branded with the logo of K-Pop boyband BTS. The rest of the district is all but deserted, but a huge line of fans of all ages and nationalities is building up around her outside the pop-up shop \u201cHouse of BTS\u201d, dedicated to the seven-piece behind \u201cBoy With Luv\u201d and other hits. K-Pop management agencies, including BTS\u2019 Big Hit Entertainment, have been expanding their retail operations to capitalize on a merchandising boom - this is the band\u2019s first outlet in Seoul with others popping up as far afield as Mexico. \u201cI want to buy some cushions, dolls, badges, things like that today, and notebooks to give to my friends,\u201d said Lee, who waited in line with her 35-year-old daughter. Branded jackets sell for 299,000 won ($257) alongside socks, sleep masks and other merchandise linked to the band which has spearheaded a wave of Korean pop music and become the first group since the Beatles to have three number one albums in the United States in less than a year. Analysts say demand for the gear is growing as the popularity of K-Pop bands spreads beyond the domestic market across other parts of Asia and into the West. Japanese fans outside the store told Reuters they had flown in because the Gangnam store \u201chad more stuff\u201d than the three BTS stores in their own country. About 1,500 fans or more visited the store during a single day last week. \u201cI\u2019m hoping to buy whatever I can,\u201d said Rebecca Mould, 25, originally from the U.S. city of Boston, a BTS fan for about two years on her first visit to the store. \u201cI already have a lot, so whatever else there is...\u201d Big Hit - an unlisted company with investments from South Korea\u2019s STIC Investments and China\u2019s Legend Capital - has launched an app called Weply to sell \u201cmerch\u201d to fans worldwide. It has also partnered with Line Friends, an affiliate of South Korea\u2019s top internet firm Naver, to sell goods linked to the \u201cBT21\u201d animated characters designed by members of BTS. \u201cThe constant derivation of new products seem to contribute a lot (to sales),\u201d said Han Sang-woung, analyst at Eugene Investment Co Ltd, who estimated agencies\u2019 merchandise profit margins at around 20%.
