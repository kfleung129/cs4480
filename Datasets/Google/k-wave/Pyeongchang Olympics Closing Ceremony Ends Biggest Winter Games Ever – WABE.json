Bill Chappell\n| NPR February 26th, 2018 The 2018 Winter Olympics\u2019 closing ceremony is being held on Sunday at the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium. Christian Hartmann / REUTERS The Winter Olympics closes the door on the Pyeongchang 2018 Games, with a big party and a last farewell from the 2,920 athletes who competed on ice and snow in South Korea. The number of athletes set a new record; so did the number of nations \u2014 92 \u2013 represented. Pyeongchang organizers promised that the Olympic Stadium, which seats 35,000, will be \u201cfilled with the roar of compliments and the applause of friendship.\u201d The two-hour ceremony started at 8 p.m. on Sunday night in South Korea \u2013 6 a.m. ET Sunday in the U.S. It began with a segment called \u201cCountdown: Dream for Tomorrow,\u201d featuring performers paying tribute to the athletes. Even as it celebrates the achievements of the past three weeks, the ceremony also looks ahead to Japan \u2014 Tokyo is slated to host the Summer Olympics in 2020 \u2014 and to China. In 2022, Beijing will become the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympic Games. At Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium, the order of entry is the same as in the opening ceremony, when the U.S. entered the Olympic Stadium 26th. Visiting delegations are ordered according to the alphabet of the host nation. The host delegation always enters last. Team USA follows countries whose names begin with \u201cM\u201d \u2014 so, after Malta and Mongolia \u2013 and before the Bs, such as Bermuda and Belgium. Cross-country skier Jessie Diggins is the U.S. flag bearer. Ceremony Program Guide and Timeline: Opening acts: first 16 minutes It all starts with a montage of the achievements and notable moments of the Winter Games in Pyeongchang, in a four-minute video piece. Then, the Korean national flag and anthem are presented, followed by a six-minute meditation and celebration of hallyu \u2014 the \u201cKorean Wave\u201d that represents the country\u2019s progress on the international economic and cultural scene in recent decades. In this section, guitarist Yang Taehwan, 13, plays a variation on \u201cWinter\u201d from Vivaldi\u2019s The Four Seasons. And then, from the program: \u201cOn the sloped stage reflecting the image of a guitar, loop dancers perform a mesmerizing dance that defies gravity. Geomungo players perform together with the band Jambinai. Korean dancers present a modern interpretation of a traditional dance while a solo dancer performs Spring Dance of Nightingale.\u201d \u2026 which leads to \u201cThe Light of Harmony and Solidarity: The lighting of the Prayer Pagoda unites everyone in the spirit of harmony and solidarity.\u201d This section of the ceremony features a unique musical instrument called the geomungo, which dates to the 4th century. From the program guide: \u201cThe round front plate of the instrument represents the sky, and the flat bottom part represents the earth; the instrument\u2019s five Notes \u2014 gung, sang, gak, chi, and wu \u2014 symbolize the Five Elements. It has been traditionally played from a sitting position, but now it can be played from a standing position. Made of paulownia wood with twisted silk strings, the geomungo used in the Closing Ceremony are also carved with the traditional arabesque design.\u201d Parade of nations Starting 16 minutes into the program, the Parade of Nations celebrates the athletes who competed and tried to live their dreams over the past 17 days. The oldest athlete at these Olympics: Canadian curler Cheryl Bernard, 51. The youngest: Chinese halfpipe skier Wu Meng, 15. Remembering those not here At 36 minutes in, the ceremony continues a tradition that started at the Rio 2016 Games, of providing a moment for everyone present to remember those who cannot join us. In the Korean version, called \u201cA Journey to Remember,\u201d there are three sections: \u201cTurtle and Kkoktu: Along with kkoktu puppets, the Turtle embarks on a journey across life and death. With the Turtle in the middle of the procession, the kkoktu puppets holding dandelions enter first, and they are followed by the dancing kkoktu puppets. \u201cThe Time Tunnel: The Turtle journeys through the Time Tunnel, the boundary between life and death. \u201cEternal Remembrance: The kkoktu puppets dance and bid farewell to the Turtle who is on his way to the heavens. Soon, the Turtle flies free into the sky.\u201d Victory ceremonies, and more From 8:43 p.m. \u2013 9:03 p.m. KT, the Olympics holds two medal ceremonies, announces new members of the International Olympic Committee athletes\u2019 commission and recognizes volunteers. Medals are presented for the men\u2019s and women\u2019s mass start cross country ski races, in which Iivo Niskanen of Finland and Marit Bjoergen of Norway accepted gold. Second hour: K-pop time We can\u2019t explain it better than the ceremony guide, although we could quibble with the second point: \u201cThe singer CL enters the stage singing her song, \u2018The Baddest Female\u2019, with 20 dancers holding torches, representing passion and the venturing spirit. She also sings 2NE1\u2019s hit song \u2018I Am the Best\u2019 to convey the message that everyone is a winner.\u201d The first song asks, \u201cWhere all my bad girls at?\u201d We\u2019ll consider that rhetorical, because CL seems to have all the answers. The crowd is into this. The transition begins The Greek national anthem is played, and the national flag of Greece is raised. This is part of the tradition of retracting the Olympic spirit from one host and extending it to another (or at least, we think that sounds good). Next, the Olympic flag is lowered and the Olympic anthem is performed. Next time in China In 2022, Beijing will become the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympic Games. It\u2019s traditional for the host cities to focus on the next edition of the games they just held, so rather than touting Japan, China gets a boost here. Beijing\u2019s section of the program includes some reminders that China has pandas. Whales are also repping China, it turns out. The video montage ends with Chinese President Xi Jinping issuing a message of warm welcome. Then graphics in the stadium show Olympics past \u2014 and everything is assembled into an invitation to come to China. And that brings us to: Speeches Lee Hee-beom, the president and CEO of the Pyeongchang Organizing Committee, speaks; so does IOC President Thomas Bach. It\u2019s been fascinating to watch the way South Korea and North Korea have interacted in the cause of the Pyeongchang Games, from the visit of Kim Yo Jong to cheer squads and athletes and staff. Bach says, \u201cWe are embracing these new horizons.\u201d To prove he\u2019s down with these horizons, Bach takes a break to pose for one of the most improbable photo ops ever: alongside a North Korean, the Tongan Olympian Pita Taufatofua (shirtless, as is his wont, on this 26-degree night), and an assemblage of colorful mascots. Bach then declares the Winter Games \u201cclosed.\u201d He adds, \u201cThank you all, and bye-bye to Korea.\u201d Not all of these North-South interactions have taken place only at a high level: We spoke to a South Korean police officer last night who was very excited because she got the chance to speak with North Korean people visiting Pyeongchang. She described them as very polite and nice to talk to. EXO Time The band EXO was listed to perform earlier in the program; not sure if it\u2019s a printing error or a schedule change, but they\u2019re here now and doing their thing. Building on a traditional gong and an electronic drum, EXO\u2019s Kai sings against a backdrop of drawings by the artist Seonglip. The rest of EXO \u201cappear riding on four-wheelers and singing their song \u2018Growl\u2019 with 43 dancers\u201d \u2014 as you do. After that, they do \u201cPower,\u201d with its eponymous refrain. If you\u2019re curious: \u201cChrome-plated four-wheelers equipped with searchlights represent the future of K-pop as the genre lights a way for the world.\u201d \u201cFarewell from a snowflake\u201d Yes, there is a segment in the ceremony titled \u201cFarewell from a Snowflake.\u201d Internet, start your engines. As part of a gift from Pyeongchang, 10 Soohorang white tiger mascots follow a large present that\u2019s escorted by a snowmobile (yes, a snowmobile). We like this kind of stuff \u2014 maybe you do, too: \u201cThe surface is decorated with embossed carvings of traditional patterns, and each edge is also decorated with the traditional accessory called norigae.\u201d Then we see the return of the five children from the opening ceremony: When the children open the present, it reveals a snow globe. The organizers capitalized it: \u201cSnow Globe\u201d \u2014 an obvious ploy to get everyone on board with this imagery. Aside: Personally, we find it unsettling to see multiple iterations of Soohorang all over the place. We enjoy being convinced of the Olympic mascot\u2019s mythic and unique status. The snowflake, it turns out, is lit: 400 performers come in holding LED balls in their hands, followed by giant balloons that refer to the globe. In case you\u2019re starting to understand things, there are also balloons that resemble Winter Olympics athletes. None of this is quite as restful and calm as we had imagined in reading it. The show is building toward a conclusion, rather than tapering. Party time From the program: \u201cWith the EDM thumping under the brightly lit sky, DJ Raiden begins the party on the ground, joined by all the athletes for the finale of the ceremony. Raiden is followed by Martin Garrix, and the performers present the LED balls to the athletes. Raiden re-enters as DJ and continues the final segment of the closing.\u201d The athletes get out on the floor and dance. And that wraps things up. With the Olympic flame extinguished, the athletes leave the stadium and say \u201cAnnyeong\u201d to the Pyeongchang Winter Games.
