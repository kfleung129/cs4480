    "text": "Planetary scientists have pretty much stopped haggling over whether Voyager 1, the space probe launched in 1977 to explore Jupiter and Saturn, has finally entered interstellar space. The tough little ship is still going strong, but there isn\u2019t exactly a signpost that marks the heliopause\u2014the place where particles streaming from the Sun bang into the thin gas that lies between the stars. As a result, there\u2019s been some confusion about when the spacecraft actually crossed that invisible boundary\u2014though there\u2019s no confusion over the fact that it did. (There\u2019s no confusion either about whether it\u2019s left the Solar System: despite last year\u2019s breathless headlines, it hasn\u2019t. Comets in the Oort Cloud, which are definitely under the Sun\u2019s gravitational influence, are much farther out than the heliopause.) But the fact that Voyager 1 is now firmly in interstellar space is evident just by the change in its surroundings, says Don Gurnett, of the University of Iowa, whose plasma wave instrument aboard the probe is the final arbiter. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely quiet out there,\u201d Gurnett says. \u201cThe magnetic fields are constant, the flux of cosmic rays is constant\u201d\u2014a sharp contrast to the turmoil of the so-called termination shock, where particles racing outward at a million m.p.h. (1.6 million k/h) slam into the relatively stationary particles that make up the interstellar medium. But the comparative quiet of distant space does not mean there\u2019s nothing going on out there. At this very moment, in fact, as Gurnett explained at a talk at the American Geophysical Union\u2019s annual meeting in San Francisco this week, the sparse interstellar gas is reeling from a powerful blast of solar particles that smashed into it last February. The eruption began its life as a coronal mass ejection or CME, a huge burst of hot plasma fired into space during a solar storm. When they hit the Earth, CMEs can disrupt electronic communications and even cause blackouts. Their impact further away is much greater, causing a kind of cosmic tsunami\u2014huge pressure waves that make the interstellar gas vibrate like a ringing bell. Indeed, a recording the spacecraft made and NASA released reveals that the phenomenon even sounds like a bell. \u201cThis shows us how much influence the Sun can have on the surrounding area,\u201d says Caltech physicist Ed Stone, who has been the Voyager project scientist since 1972, \u201cand it\u2019s very likely to be the same with other stars.\u201d Voyager detected its first cosmic tsunami back in the 1990\u2019s when the impact of a CME colliding with the heliopause created a blast of radio waves. They\u2019re too faint to be picked up from Earth, says Stone. \u201cYou need to be out by Saturn, at least, to detect them.\u201d By 2012, the spacecraft was close enough to the heliopause to experience a later tsunami directly, recording a steep increase in the density of the gas it was flying through. It felt another in 2013, and the probe is now in the midst of its third, which was still going nine months later\u2014a period during which Voyager 1 traveled a quarter of a billion miles (.4 billion km). No one knows how far into space the tsunami will travel before it fades out, says Gurnett. \u201cI\u2019m guessing it could be another hundred astronomical units or more.\u201d That, by the way, is a whole lot. An astronomical unit is the equivalent of the distance between the Earth and the sun\u2014or 93 million mi. (150 million km). A hundred of those is 9.3 billion miles\u2014or 15 billion km. Voyager 1 is currently at 130 A.U., or about 12 billion miles; it will have to reach 21.3 billion just to catch up with the outer reach of the tsunami\u2014a journey that will take decades. Stone, Gurnett and the other Voyager scientists won\u2019t have to wait that long for another big event, however. The Voyager 2 probe, which lagged behind its sister ship so it could take a look at Uranus and Neptune, is currently at 109 A.U. from the Sun, and approaching its own rendezvous with the heliopause. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping it will happen in the next couple of years,\u201d says Stone. If it\u2019s hard to imagine what it\u2019s like for Stone to watch the Voyager probes continue to make discoveries more than four decades after he took over the project, he offers a single, simple word of explanation: \u201cWonderful.\u201d Contact us at letters@time.com.
