    "text": "The K-pop legend returns after five years with an album to appeal to today's youth and the 30- to 40-year-olds. By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tJeff Benjamin Following his groundbreaking start with Seotaiji and the Boys\u00a0in the \u201990s, Seotaiji\u00a0has remained an important musical figure in Korean music with his experimental rock- and metal-inspired albums. The 42-year-old introduced Quiet Night,\u00a0his ninth solo album and first in five years, via \u201cSogyeokdong,\u201d\u00a0a collaboration with\u00a0IU\u00a0on vocals that revealed K-pop legend\u2019s new sonic muse as \u201980s-inspired new wave and synth-pop. The track acted as an accessible, dreamy first taste to the LP that feels like a deep exploration into the world of old-school synthesizer sounds.

Still, it\u2019s a big treat to get two different takes of one of the best songs to come out of Korea this year.  Quiet Night then moves\u00a0into second single \u201cChristmalo.Win\u201d that feels like the type of track Tim Burton\u00a0would feature on his next film. Possibly taking an inspiration from Burton\u2019s beloved 1993 film\u00a0The Nightmare Before Christmas,\u00a0the track mentions aspects of Christmas and Halloween (Santa, trick-or-treating and Christmas wine) with even a few Halloween Town-esque voices cackling and squawking over the spastic synth-rock production. The twisted-holiday theme is kept in the epic, nine-minute accompanying video that features a little girl in a world of witches, devils and haunted pumpkins looking to find Santa Claus.   Album closer \u201cThe Christmas Miracle\u201d is the last reference towards holidays on the album as the longest song of the album concluding the disc with a soothing mix of piano, woodwinds, jinging bells and synth squishing. But that\u2019s not before other spectacular synth standouts including \u201c90s ICON,\u201d a rushing, woozy mix of ominous synths and strong piano melodies centered around a chorus where Seo Taiji\u2019s vocal tiptoe from note to note. The new-wave influence is probably best heard in \u201cFighter of the Forest,\u201d that appearas to include a sample of\u00a0Matt Wilder\u2018s \u201cBreak My Stride,\u201d a top 5 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in the early \u201980s. With the K-pop market flooded with K-pop idols and hip-hop stars,\u00a0Seo Taiji asfound a way to tap into the youth consciousness while still providing music that can be enjoyed by an older generation, taking the latter back to a time when maybe they too were inundated and in love with pop music.
