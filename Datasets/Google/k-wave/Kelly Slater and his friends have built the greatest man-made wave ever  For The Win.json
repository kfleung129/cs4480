    "text": "The man-made wave is something that\u2019s been a staple at water parks for years, but it was a gimmick, something for kids and tourists and never viewed as a real substitute for high-level surfers. Kelly Slater has spent the last decade with a team working on creating an artificial wave that manages to approximate the real thrill of surfing. It looks like they got there. If not there, then really, really close.  The video doesn\u2019t go into much detail about how the wave is created, but for now, it\u2019s cool to know they\u2019ve done it. This will change the game in surfing, in how the greats can train. No matter the swell or weather conditions, they will have a wave. This is amazing.  Slater was eliminated from Billabong Pipe Masters on Thursday by Mick Fanning in the quarterfinals, but he\u2019ll take \u201ccreated the greatest man-made wave ever\u201d as a consolation I\u2019m sure.
