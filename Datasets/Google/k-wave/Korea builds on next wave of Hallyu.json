Luxury goods maker LVMH is the latest company  to bet on South Korea's \"cool\" \u2013 its private  equity arm unveiled plans last week to invest up to $80  million in YG Entertainment, who manages K-Pop stars  including superstar rapper Psy. The investment is the largest by a global fund  and will help accelerate YG's move into fashion. The firm,  one of Korea's top talent agencies, aims to launch a  clothing label with Samsung Group and to enter the  cosmetic business with China's Huanya Group. Read MoreWhat do South Korea and India have  in common? YG shares have surged 25 percent since  LVMH's interest first emerged earlier this month, bringing the  firm's market capitalization to $730 million and underscoring the  power of Hallyu in corporate Korea. \"Right across the board, with consumer and cultural  products [in South Korea] there is a huge outward wave of  interest coming from the outside, which is turning into money,\"  said Tony Michell, managing director at Korea Associates Business  Consultancy. \"From an advertising point of view K-Pop stars in Southeast  Asia have become hot property, and we think it gives a kind of PR  effect to Korea, as behind that comes everything related to  Korean fashion and that goes from cosmetics and other things  positioned in the dramas or associated with Korea,\" he  added. Read MoreChoinomics - Breakthrough for South  Korea? Korea's \"cool\" factor reached fever pitch in  2012 when pop sensation Psy released the mega-hit 'Gangnam  Style,' a catchy rap song with horse dance moves that became a  worldwide hit. The video has garnered over 2 billion views  to date online, making Psy the most famous K-Pop  singer globally and raising the genre's  profile. Since then, there has been renewed interest in all other  aspects of Korean culture, spanning music, TV shows, video games,  fast food and consumer products. Some experts are tipping the start of the next  wave of Hallyu, this time driven by China. According to CLSA,  China's Tencent's decision in March to invest half a billion  dollars in CJ Games, a unit of Korean media firm CJ E&M, is a  big deal for the firm and a ringing endorsement for  K-culture. Read MoreFood and fashion:How K-drama is  influencing Asia The investment gives China's largest online-games and  social-networking company a 28 percent stake in CJ Games, one the  most successful game developers in Korea. \"Hallyu will continue to gain momentum and CJ E&M is at the  forefront of this wave,\" Seungjoo Ro, an analyst at CLSA, said  in a report this week. \"Demand is high in China and will unlock  much awaited earnings expansion for CJ's media and films.\" Strong government support CLSA says the Korean craze looks sustainable for now, thanks to  the strong support from the government, which has invested  billions in the K-Pop phenomenon, including launching a $1  billion investment fund to support the pop industry in 2005. Read MoreThis is big business in Korea (and it's  not K-pop) The country last year raked in $5 billion from its pop-culture  exports, and the government aims to double this figure by 2017.  Meanwhile, inbound tourist arrivals jumped 8.3  percent on year to a record 12.2 million visitors in  2013, statistics from the Korea Tourism Organization (KTO) show. \"Currently, the government's budget for culture/media is around  5.3 trillion won ($5.2 billion), or about 1.4 percent of  government spending. The goal is to increase this budget to 7.8  trillion won by 2017, or 2 percent of the government's budget,\"  Ro said. \"This will make Korea the second highest cultural  spender behind France,\" he added.
