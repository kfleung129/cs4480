    "text": "Advertisement July 3, 2020 | 4 min read Listen to article\n                 \n4 min Streaming platforms like Hong Kong-based Viu have been investing in drama content, particularly Korean drama (K-drama), amid increased interest across the world in Korean cultural properties. The \u2018Korean Wave\u2018, or \u2018hallyu\u2018 is credited with spreading a host of fashion and makeup trends. Korean dramas are often marked out by high production values, attractive casts and complex storylines. \u201cThe shows are melodramtic but they all resonate well with our viewers, who circulate them on social media,\u201d says Virginia Lim, the chief content officer for Viu, speaking during The Drum\u2018s Can-Do Festival. \u201cViu has worked closely with the top five South Korean broadcasters (SBS, KBS, NBC, CJENM and JTBC) to secure more than 90% of Korean entertainment content. We bring to our viewers the freshest Korean content in as fast as four hours from Koreans telecasts with local language subtitling. It\u2018s our promise to bring to our viewers the most and best of Korean content.\u201d As countries across Asia Pacific went into lockdown, a Media Partners Asia report on online video streaming found that overall average weekly viewing minutes across Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand increased by 60% between January and April this year. The same report found that Viu had a 274% increase. According to Lim, more than 50% of viewers are watching or have watched its original series Pretty Little Liars and Korean drama A World of Married Couple. A World of Married Couple has achieved the highest ratings in the history of cable TV in Korea. \u201c\u2018A World of Married Couple\u2019 was first premiered on Viu with subtitles in six languages and it has become the most-watched drama series on Viu since the lockdown started. Some of the shows currently trending on our platform include our very own Thai drama, My Bubble Tea and Korean dramas, like Good Casting, Oh My Baby, Sweet Munchies,\u201d explains Lim. \u201cThen in June, we launched the second season of The Bridge, a Viu original in collaboration with HBO Asia. In July, we will also be launching popular Korean dramas like To All the Guys Who Loved Me, Flower of Evil, Train and The Good Detective.\u201d Even though production budgets have been slashed because of the coronavirus-related downturn, Viu is continuing to develop and monetise existing and potential relationships with brands to help them understand that in the streaming world, primetime can be anywhere. According to Lim, Viu uses content discovery strategies and machine learning to help brands to reach a specific audience defined by their interests, rather than the timeslot. For example, in Thailand, where the Viu original series My Bubble Tea was filmed, Viu worked with AP Honda to get the star actor Mean Phiravich to act as a rider to deliver bubble tea on a Honda motorcycle. \u201cIn Singapore, for example, our campaign with title sponsor FWD Insurance for our original No Sleep No FOMO highlighted the importance of insurance coverage as part of our travel plans. This ties in with exactly what No Sleep No FOMO is about \u2013 experiencing the unexpected,\u201d explains Lim. \u201cThese are some examples that we had done. Another example is in Indonesia. Indonesia, the brand Ponds celebrated mother\u2018s day by highlighting how Indonesian women always radiate positive energy with an inspiring mom story placed with Glow, a Viu original series.\u201d Post-pandemic, Lim says Viu will continue to invested in content and strive to become the content platform with the most \u2013 and best \u2013 Korean shows on the market. She points out that streaming was gaining ground on live television before the pandemic, and believes this will only continue. \u201cThe pandemic, if anything, may just have accelerated these changes in viewing habits. Online streaming is here to stay. Streaming will be the norm moving forward, if anything. Viewers today want to be able to access content when they want it, where they want it and not be controlled or limited by a fixed time slot schedule,\u201d she says. Lim spoke with The Drum\u2019s Shawn Lim as part of The Drum\u2018s Can-Do Festival, an online event celebrating the positive energy, innovation and creative thinking that can make the marketing community such a powerful force for good.
