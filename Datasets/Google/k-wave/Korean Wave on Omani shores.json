    "text": "Muscat \u2013 Korean culture has taken over the world by storm. Korean language, cuisine, fashion, music, TV series and movies have a significant influence on youngsters in many parts of the world. Referred to as the Korean Wave, it has spread far and wide since its origins in 1990s, influencing teenagers and young adults from Asia to Africa to Europe.\nThis global phenomenon reached Omani shores, too, some time ago and is now deeply entrenched in some sections of youngsters, both citizens and residents, who embrace many aspects of Korean culture. It\u2019s not uncommon to find millennials watching K-drama, dancing to K-pop tunes, even actively learning Korean.\nThe heightened emphasis on delivering high-quality products has enabled Korean brands and the entertainment industry to provide premium quality products and content to the rest of the world and attract new customers.\nKnown for affordability and fast fashion, Korean clothes have evolved rapidly and now compete with some of the top international brands. Bold yet balanced, colourful yet tasteful, Korean fashion has created popular trends. The clothes of popular K-pop and K-drama artists are influencing the rest of the world, redefining fashion standards, breaking barriers and making South Korea a fashion destination for many.\nThe influence of Korean fashion is reflected in the way the youth of Oman are dressing, as can be seen at popular hang-outs of hipsters. Ankle-length pants, baggy pants, oversized shirts and bucket hats \u2013 all influenced by Korean fashion trends \u2013 are in clear display.\nFatma al Saadi was inspired to adopt Korean fashion because of its simplicity and uniqueness. \u201cThe beauty of their fashion is that it immediately makes you think of Korea, and their contemporary style is rarely seen in western films and pop music,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI also feel that Korean culture has a few similarities to Omani culture,\u201d Fatma claimed.\nBesides fashion, youngsters in Oman are increasingly developing a keen interest in K-drama and films. Korean series and films, including Train to Busan, Crash Landing on You, Parasite and Squid Game, have been lapped up by young people in Oman and created viewership records.
