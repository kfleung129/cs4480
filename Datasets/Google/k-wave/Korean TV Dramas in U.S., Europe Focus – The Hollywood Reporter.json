By Lee Hyo-won, Georg Szalai \n\n\tApril 5, 2016 3:44am On March 27, Wolmido Island off the coast of Incheon, South Korea, hosted a feast featuring 3,000 fried chickens and 4,500 cans of local beer. It was a corporate event for the 6,000-odd employees of a Chinese cosmetics company, part of a weeklong themed trip inspired by the smash hit Korean TV soap My Love From Another Star. Chicken and beer are the daily staples of the series\u2019 heroine, who, as the title suggests, falls in love with a beautiful (though anti-social) alien. Since it began broadcasting in China in 2014, the fantasy romance from Seoul Broadcasting System (SBS) has been credited for a 200 percent spike in annual Korean beer exports to the middle kingdom.  Korean TV dramas and entertainment programs have long been a hot commodity across Asia and have inspired cult followings across South America, the Middle East and even parts of Africa. International sales of Korean shows generated $180 million for broadcasters and producers in 2009 and have since enjoyed an annual average growth rate of 13.8 percent, according to the Korea Communications Commission. Now the U.S. and European industries are looking to catch the Korean wave. Last month, ITV Studios licensed Korean supernatural cop drama Who Are You for a remake, the first time a Korean fiction series has been licensed for the U.K. The original series stars So E-Hyun as an elite policewoman who, after awakening from a six-year coma, finds she can see and speak with ghosts. She\u2019s teamed up with a skeptical junior detective (played by TaecYeon). The ITV deal was the latest European license for a Korean drama struck by by Eccho Rights, the Swedish rights group that has found a lucrative side business in selling shows form new boom territories (South Korea, Turkey) to European broadcasters. Eccho previously signed a deal with Endemol Shine in Italy to develop a local version of Korean series Ice Adonis, about a woman who is betrayed by her stepsister and loses everything. The show has already been successfully adapted for Ukrainian TV, where it was a ratings hit in 2015. \u201cKorean dramas have storylines that are quite original. They are not afraid to make surprising twists and turns, and they are very cleverly done in general,\u201d said Nicola Soderlund, managing partner at Eccho Rights. \u201cThe pacing also helps. They are not as slow as is very often the case in other territories.\u201d In 2014, ABC greenlit an adaptation of My Love From Another Star, handing out a remake script commitment with a penalty attached. Park Ji-eun, creator of the original series, was on board to executive produce, but the show didn\u2019t make the cut for the following TV season.  ? The same was true for ABC\u2019s planned remake of time travel thriller Nine: Nine Time Travels, CBS\u2019 medical drama based on the Korean series Good Doctor and CW\u2019s U.S. version of Oh My Ghostess, a rom-com series with a supernatural twist (shy girl gets possessed by spirit of virginal ghost determined to get laid). \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that these American remakes aren\u2019t immediately happening,\u201d said Korean pop culture critic Kim Bong Seok. \u201cKorean dramas remain a niche genre outside of the country. Series like My Love From Another Star feature elements of fantasy that appeal to Asian viewers, while their conservative depictions of romance and family values and the toned-down violence resonate with Middle Easterners. The melodrama seems to strike a chord with telenovela-watching South Americans.\u201d For an American audience, however, Korean TV can be an acquired taste. \u201cKorean dramas focus\u2026less on the over-sexualization you see in Western entertainment, and there is much less violence,\u201d said Park. A full season for a Korea show is often just 16 episodes, which can also make it a challenge for American networks looking to stretch a narrative to fit their 26-episode season. \u201cThe milestone to say the Korean industry has achieved global status is getting some remake done in the U.S. None of them really passed the initial pilot stage,\u201d said\u00a0Suk Park, co-founder and president of DramaFever, a video streaming site specializing in Korean TV series that has licensing deals with all three major Korean TV networks. \u201cIn Western countries, [the audience for Korean dramas is] still much more of a pure online base.\u201d  Angela Killoren, COO at CJ E&M America, explained: \u201cThe real popularity of K drama started from just the original dramas being made accessible online. Then people started hearing about these incredible numbers \u2014 millions of people a month out of the U.S. and all these countries outside Korea watching, and people were very intrigued.\u201d And that has led to interest in remakes. But that audience watching Korean shows online is already substantial \u2014 and growing. According to a November 2014 consumer research report by Korea Creative Content Agency USA, approximately 18 million people were watching Korean dramas in the U.S. through DramaFever. Earlier this year, Warner Bros. acquired the streaming site, buying out previous owner Japan\u2019s SoftBank. Viki, another streaming service specializing in Korean drama, recently picked up U.S. rights to another hit series, Descendants of the Sun, which DramaFever also offers. The larger-than-life romance, currently airing on Korean Broadcasting System 2 , has sold to 32 territories and counting, including the U.K., France, Italy, Germany and Spain. John Duncan, co-director of UCLA\u2019s Center for Korean Studies, sees a parallel between the growth in online niche markets for Korean series in the U.S. and the similar 1980s U.S. subculture around Japanese animations. \u201cKids today, even in remote parts of the U.S. where there aren\u2019t Koreans, are downloading Korean films and dramas,\u201d he told The Korea Times.  \u201cHere in Hollywood, the hunt is on for new stories,\u201d Killoren\u00a0said. \u201cThere are these stories coming out of Korea showing that they do have global appeal, which has people looking. And a lot of people we talk to in TV, when they watch them, they say they are also into these dramas and binge-watch. One of the writers we work with, she started really getting into this drama herself and said, I need to adapt this.\u201d Added Park: \u201cEveryone [in the business] is looking for different stories. There is sort of a sense of general fatigue and that the same stories have been told the same way over and over again.\u201d? Why hasn\u2019t there been a major remake of a Korean drama in the U.S. yet? \u201cA lot of people are watching the originals, but people also watch a lot of stories in their own language, and that becomes this source of remakes potentially,\u201d said\u00a0Killoren. \u201cThat said, there is a lot of competition, and a lot of things go into development and don\u2019t necessarily come out. We\u2019re still waiting for our first real Korean drama to hit the main stage, but we are pretty hopeful that that\u2019s going to happen very soon.\u201d Korea\u2019s non-scripted television has been more successful. NBC picked up Grandpas Over Flowers, a senior citizen travelogue reality show, making it the first non-scripted Korean format to be adapted by a U.S. network. William Shatner, Henry Winkler, George Foreman, Jeff Dye and Terry Bradshaw signed on to star in the U.S. version, entitled Better Late Than Never, and traveled through major cities in Asia. Parts of the U.S. show were shot in Korea last summer. The actors visited traditional \u201cjjimjilbang\u201d spas and viewed the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea before moving on to Japan and Hong Kong. \u201cHollywood is always looking all over the for fresh ideas and proven shows,\u201d said\u00a0Keo Lee, development executive at 3AD, a film and TV production company that is trying to bring Korean formats to the U.S. \u201cBecause of the cultural and industry differences, it is a challenge to adapt shows. It\u2019s not easy, but multiple parties are trying, and sooner or later it\u2019ll happen.\u201d  Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Send us a tip using our anonymous form.
