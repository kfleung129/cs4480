    "text": "MANILA, Philippines \u2014 Behind impeccably choreographed dance steps, catchy tunes and charming fan services, there are massive expectations placed on idols of the ultra-competitive K-pop industry.  That\u2019s why 2PM\u2019s Nichkhun Horvejkul and former U-Kiss member Alexander Lee Eusebio\u2014both part of the so-called second-generation K-pop\u2014have this to say to younger idols: don\u2019t stress yourselves too much. \u201cThe young kids keep getting better and better,\u201d Nichkhun said during the exclusive press conference of tvN\u2019s \"One Night Food Trip\" Friday. The Thai-American celebrity added: \u201cI just want to tell them now this is a very stressful time for them because a lot of [groups] are coming out within a year and just a lot more competition and you know I just hope for the best for them.\u201d Currently, K-pop is dominated by groups such as EXO, BTS and Bigbang despite the group\u2019s hiatus due to South Korea\u2019s mandatory military enlistment policy. Newer groups such as Blackpink, Twice, Seventeen, GOT7, among others are also contributing to one of the country\u2019s major exports. Both Nichkhun and Alexander noted that there was lesser competition during their time. \u201cIt would be just us (2PM and U-Kiss), Shinee, 2AM.\u201d Alexander, for his part, advised newer K-pop stars to \u201cstay true to themselves and don\u2019t be mayabang (arrogant).\u201d He added that he is proud of the boy group BTS, who recently performed at the 2018 Billboard Music Awards and bagged the Top Social Artist recognition for two years in a row. 2PM was formed in 2008 under JYP Entertainment. Aside from Nichkhun, the current members are Jun.K, Taecyeon, Wooyoung, Junho and Chansung. U-Kiss, on the other hand, was established by NH Media in 2008. The group is known for their breakthrough hits such as \"Man Man Ha Ni\" and \"Bingeul Bingeul.\" Alexander left the group in 2011 and has since become a solo artist.
