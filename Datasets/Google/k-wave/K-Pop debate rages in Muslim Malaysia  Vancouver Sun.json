    "text": "While the West has become a target of the Islamic extremists, the Far East has faced far less criticism and outrage. But an event last week \u2014 somewhat overlooked in the West because of the Paris attacks \u2014 has sparked fresh, heated debate over the clash of cultures, this time between one of Asia\u2019s most-westernized countries and another where the mainstream culture remains staunchly observant to its majority Muslim faith.

During the show, the singers invited several fans onstage to meet the group. Three fans wearing head scarves were invited to act out scenes from a Korean drama. During the skits, the girls shared hugs with the singers; one girl was cuddling with one idol while another received a kiss on her forehead. A video of that was posted onto YouTube on Jan. 10. It quickly went viral in Malaysia, triggering outrage among the country\u2019s religious conservatives. Malaysia \u2014 which has civil laws strictly outlining what\u2019s not appropriate in terms of public displays of affection \u2014 moved quickly. The country\u2019s Federal Territories Islamic Religious Department, charged with maintaining religious moral standards, said last Wednesday the three girls will be given a week to turn themselves in. If they do not do so, warrants for their arrest will be issued, the department\u2019s director said. The concert\u2019s organizers are also being investigated.

The furor exposes the extent to which Korean pop culture (popularly dubbed K-Pop) has swept traditionally conservative Southeast Asia and the complexities within Malaysian society in terms of religion\u2019s role in government. The movement known as Hanryu \u2014 or Korean Wave \u2014 has seen Korean pop music and television drama dominate the airwaves in many markets. While K-Pop has a growing and loyal following among young Europeans and North Americans, places like China, Japan, Australia, Vietnam, The Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia have borne the brunt of this cultural phenomenon. Different countries have had different reactions to this onslaught of pop-culture glitter. Chinese fans have, for the most part, embraced it. Japan is so taken by its impact that Tokyo launched a counter-offensive in its \u201cCool Japan\u201d movement to promote its own pop cultural assets. But it is in Southeast Asia \u2014 especially in Muslim countries like Malaysia \u2014 where the rise of such pop cultural influence has drawn the most opposition from social conservatives. Malaysia\u2019s own definition of its relationship with the Muslim faith has been complex. Government leaders often tinker with their wording when it comes to the question whether Malaysia is an official Islamic state. What is not up for debate, however, is that Islam plays a dominant role in Malay culture, where more than 60 per cent of the population is Muslim. That\u2019s why Malaysian law, while derived from British common law, has a distinct local flavour. And it is also why the state has agencies that work to preserve the adherence to Islamic norms in Malaysian society.
