    "text": "Vulture This article originally appeared in\u00a0Vulture. There\u2019s a song near the end of rising South Florida rapper XXXTentacion\u2019s just-released 17\u00a0called \u201cCarry On,\u201d where the 11-track mini-album\u2014a ramshackle mix of half-conceived folk musings and confessional depression raps\u2014drops both its amateurish singer-songwriter contrivances and conventional hip-hop rhyme patterns in favor of raw emotion: \u201cTrapped in a concept, falsely accused, was used and misled / Bitch, I\u2019m hoping you fucking rest in peace.\u201d It\u2019s more than just your average jilted breakup rap. The person XXXTentacion is talking about\u00a0is an ex-girlfriend who accused the rapper, born Jahseh Onfroy, of punching, kicking, strangling, and imprisoning her while she was pregnant, charges he will stand trial for this fall. In spite of those allegations, and an interview on BMX star Adam22\u2019s \u201cNo Jumper\u201d show in which he detailed beating a gay juvenile detention center cellmate half to death and smearing the blood on his face because he caught the kid glaring, the rapper was recently selected for XXL\u2019s 2017 Freshman List, which celebrates young hip-hop talent poised for superstardom. (Past honorees include J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar, and Chance the Rapper.) 17 is presently on pace to bow out shockingly close to the top of this week\u2019s Billboard 200 chart. While he sat in prison for the domestic-battery charge last year, XXXTentacion\u2014that\u2019s \u201cex, ex, ex, tentaci\u00f3n\u201d\u2014gained a following as his breakneck trap brawler \u201cLook at Me!\u201d took clubs and concerts by siege. Elsewhere, Florida rapper Kodak Black logged hits in \u201cSkrt\u201d and \u201cTunnel Vision,\u201d which laced sublime tracks with stark dispatches from his life in and out of jail on robbery and drug-possession charges. (His \u201cNo Flockin\u2019\u201d\u00a0introduced the rhyme flow Bronx star Cardi B used for her smash hit \u201cBodak Yellow.\u201d) This year Kodak awaits trial for a 2016 sexual-assault charge. A second similar incident from February has yet to reach the courts. Kodak\u2019s latest, Project Baby 2, a bleak collection of musings on love and hopelessness, is No. 2 in the country this week. While X and Kodak shine on the album chart, Texas teen rapper Tay-K has crept halfway up the Hot 100 with \u201cThe Race.\u201d It bluntly recounts the time the 17-year-old rapper and murder suspect clipped his ankle monitor and tried to outrun the cops: \u201cFuck a beat, I was trying to beat a case / But I ain\u2019t beat the case, bitch, I did the race.\u201d A court case used to be an imposing obstacle for an artist\u2019s growth, a setback artists fought for their lives to overcome, but in 2017, assault and battery cases don\u2019t seem as damaging. In the same way that selling drugs sharpened Jay-Z and Snoop Dogg\u2019s bona fides in the \u201890s and getting shot nine times transformed 50 Cent from neighborhood rabble-rouser into a spokesperson for the streets in the aughts, proof of a young rapper\u2019s reckless abandon now grows his legend and emboldens his authenticity. Would Tay-K\u2019s song, or incarcerated New York rhymer Bobby Shmurda\u2019s shoot-em-up anthem \u201cHot Nigga,\u201d connect if every word didn\u2019t feel lived? Would XXXTentacion\u2019s mix of speaker-busting punk-rap and sad-sack campfire songs ring true if he seemed at all concerned for his own well-being? Rap fans have a peculiar outlook on heroism because hip-hop culture exists as a monument to black inner-city craftiness in the face of crumbling infrastructure, tightening gang presence, and hyperactive policing. Injustice begat mistrust, which tripped off a thousand cat-and-mouse games between law enforcement and inner-city entrepreneurs, ranging from simple music and movie bootlegging and loose-cigarette and unlicensed-alcohol sales all the way up the chain to coke and crack manufacturing and distribution. Good and evil seemed porous and nebulous to a generation that grew up in the shadow of government neglect and police misconduct. Police could be seen harassing unarmed citizens; kingpins handed out turkeys at Thanksgiving. Gangsta rap made folk heroes out of men and women who risked their safety to bend the rules and prosper as outlaws. The greats presented crime as a political act, a means of leveling a playing field that always operated on a severe tilt. They gave voice to the struggles of the disadvantaged and illuminated a way out for the daring. Harsh nationwide response\u2014presidential rebukes, steamrolling CDs, obscenity trials\u2014steeled fans of the music to criticism to a degree we\u2019ve never quite recovered from. To love rap is to crusade for its honor, to suspend disbelief and enjoy it free of moralizing. This complex makes it tough to challenge the stuff even now; many a valuable talk on rap misogyny and homophobia has been derailed by passing the blame up the chain of command to America at large, instead of reckoning with the role of artists and fans in coddling social ills they, admittedly, didn\u2019t invent. Comedian Eric Andre caught hell on Twitter this month for asking why people who hate racism entertain music that promotes sexism. It\u2019s not a crazy question, but the timing never works. There\u2019s always a bigger concern eating up attention. While we hem and haw about how to even talk about rappers with open murder, battery, and sexual-assault cases, their success seems to render the conversation moot. Music fans\u2019 mantra about compartmentalizing craft and crafter\u2014\u201cYou gotta separate the art from the artist\u201d\u2014offers catchy, consequence-free support and promotion of artists who deserve more scrutiny. It has allowed decades of talented but abusive men to be celebrated as geniuses while the troublesome aspects of their lives languished in the back pages of history. It is not a noble thought process; it is apathy disguised as passing concern. The furthest the dialogue about XXXTentacion got was a handful of thinkers and long reads asking if he should be famous or not. While those gears turned, the powder keg personality set out on a volatile tour. At one stop, an opener got beat up in the crowd. Another saw X punch a fan in the face unprovoked. At a third, the rapper got knocked out cold and carried off in the middle of his own set. The whole tour was called off before I could check it out in NYC. A consequence of centering a movement in unchecked male aggression is that it eventually becomes impossible to control, and to my eyes and ears, rap has been quietly spiraling toward a disaster for a while now. I distinctly remember the moment it became appropriate to mosh at a rap show, because it seemed to happen all at once. I caught a Diplomats show in Times Square in 2010 and watched one of a then-emergent A$AP Mob dive off the stage, accidentally spear the glasses off the guy standing next to me, and then offer to step outside if the kid was upset enough to fight. The same year I saw Odd Future turn the Studio at Webster Hall into pandemonium during their first show in the city. The next year, I caught a headline set by A$AP Rocky at CMJ\u2019s Fader Fort that ended abruptly with a stage manager getting jumped and sent to the hospital for stitches. Rap shows and rock shows have always run a little rowdy, but it wasn\u2019t until recently that you could ever mistake the energy of one for the other. Rap shows got buck, but you watched where your hands and feet went so you didn\u2019t get snuffed for stepping on kicks or breaching certain personal space boundaries. At a lot of rock shows, that kind of reckless jostling was the point. Nowadays, rappers pause shows to encourage fans to brace themselves for moshing. This isn\u2019t to say that \u201crap is the new rock\u201d because the two scenes have shared players for years. The Beastie Boys were a hardcore band before they landed on beats and rhymes, and the trio returned to those roots throughout their career. The early \u201890s saw Chuck D pop up on a Sonic Youth song and KRS-One on an R.E.M. one. Living Colour, Faith No More, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers were heralds of a rap-rock revolution at the end of the \u201880s that Rage Against the Machine, Limp Bizkit, and Korn would warp through the late \u201890s and beyond. The last bit should be a point of concern in examining the current rap landscape. Nu metal operated on a few core misunderstandings of rap in the same way a few key figures circling the rap mainstream are misguided in lionizing rock stars. The worst of it mistook rap for an art of baseless defiance and aggression, rather than a pointed shank forged out of disenfranchisement. In the space of a single year, Limp Bizkit devolved from scuzzy empowerment anthems to gibberish about sticking cookies up assholes. Even Rage, the most eloquent and pointedly political act on the scene by a country mile, saw its message grossly reduced to simple brutality in crowds screaming along to \u201cKilling in the Name\u201d: \u201cFUCK YOU, I WON\u2019T DO WHAT YOU TELL ME!\u201d The whole scene folded in a frenzy of grabbing hands and flying fists, as Woodstock \u201899 burned down, killing the \u201890s as dead as Altamont did the \u201860s. As powerful and vibrant of a culture as hip-hop is, we\u2019re always just one horrific event away from stifling nightlife reform. The repercussions for violence at a rap show trickle down to everyone, as New York showgoers can attest after a May 2016 shooting inside an Irving Plaza gig featuring Brooklyn rapper Troy Ave led to tightened security measures at shows and heavily armed guards at Governors Ball this summer. The more of a threat of violence that a rap show presents to a venue, the less of them they\u2019re likely to book. It doesn\u2019t matter how hot your single is if you\u2019re seen as a security risk. We owe it to the women who say they\u2019ve been hurt by these artists to stop offering them space in interviews to trash their accusers before everyone gets their day in court. We owe it to the (increasingly) young fans of these guys\u2014who place their safety in the hands of both artist and venue at every concert\u2014to ensure that the performer onstage isn\u2019t acting against the best interests of his audience (as the Houston rapper Travis Scott does when he goads fans to jump off venue balconies and ignore festival partitioning at his shows). The current climate of simply shoveling more money and clout at rappers with dangerous tendencies and hoping they\u2019ll straighten themselves out is untenable. Labels need to do more training. Fans need to do more soul-searching. We need to ask more questions. Inaction is an action. History is watching.
