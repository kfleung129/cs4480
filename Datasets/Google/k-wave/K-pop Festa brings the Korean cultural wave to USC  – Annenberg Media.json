(Photo by Michael Chow) After a year of planning, USC hosted the first ever K-pop concert held at an American university last Friday. K-pop Festa brought Hallyu, or the spread of Korean culture, center stage with an all-day event featuring performances by popular soloist Kim Sejeong and rookie boy group Kingdom, as well as an academic forum exploring the global K-pop phenomenon. The event was a collaboration between the Annenberg School of Communication, the East Asian Studies Center, the Korean Cultural Center in Los Angeles (KCCLA), the Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism and Korean Foundation for International Cultural Exchange (KOFICE). The idea to first bring a K-pop concert to campus began with Hye Jin Lee, a clinical assistant communications professor at Annenberg who organized the event. \u201cI just wanted to have an event on campus that not only helps us to think about how K-pop is changing American pop culture in general, but to think about new ways to do music concerts on campus,\u201d she said.

Since K-pop is getting mainstream, she believed it could engage the entire USC community. \u201cK-pop is not limited to international students or Asian American or Korean American diasporas,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt\u2019s gradually more widely accepted, so I wanted to test it out, what it would be like to see K-pop concerts on campus.\u201d That afternoon, USC Annenberg hosted an academic forum featuring a panel of graduate students and Dom Rodriguez, the Senior Vice President of SM Entertainment USA. The panel explored what makes K-pop universally appealing. \u201cIt\u2019s everything that happens after the song is released that makes it special,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cIn K-pop, every song has a journey.\u201d Outside the panel, students and non-USC K-pop fans flocked to McCarthy Quad to line up for the concert early. Some hoped to find a friend so they could sneakily cut in line. Other students skipped classes to get in line at 1 p.m. By sunset, the line snaked around the Center for International and Public Affairs and tailed off midway through Alumni Park. Many fans waiting in McCarthy Quad use KCCLA\u2019s merchandise fans as a way to shield their face from the sun. (Photo by Michael Chow) To Caleb Huang, a senior studying international relations, the length of the line was impressive. \u201cWhen I started listening to K-pop, it was getting popular, but it still wasn\u2019t as popular as it is today,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when I went around the line to see how many people wanted to go in and watch the concert, it feels like here, in 2022, K-pop has come a long way since then.\u201d For fans who didn\u2019t want to wait, there was another way to skip the line: become a volunteer. Katelyn Hsu, a sophomore studying human biology and human development and aging, volunteered for the event after her friend\u2019s professor mentioned the opportunity in class. \u201cI\u2019ve usually gone to K-pop events just to watch them perform,\u201d Hsu said, \u201cso I kind of wanted to see how a big event on this scale was managed.\u201d Hsu\u2019s duties included checking USC students\u2019 QR codes and supervising the ADA seating section to ensure people seated needed accommodations. Before any spectators came inside, she could watch all of the performers warm up, including Sejeong. \u201cIt took me a second to recognize it was her warming up,\u201d Hsu said. \u201cI talked to the person next to me and she said, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s Sejeong.\u2019 It was surreal, to say the least.\u201d The program for K-pop Festa\u2019s concert kicked off past 6 p.m. with welcoming introductions from KCCLA and Professor Lee. Then, 12 U.S. finalists for the K-Pop Cover Dance Festival competed for a chance to go to the championships in Seoul. Each finalist was judged by Kingdom, who applauded them for their exceptional performances. Ultimately, the Chicago-based group Prism Kru won first place with their performance of \u201cMaverick\u201d by The Boyz.

Their set ranged from powerful and up-tempo songs to sentimental ballads, coupled with sharp dance moves and well-trained vocals. The energy of their performance was memorable, even to fans who only heard of them recently. \u201cIt was really cool to see Kingdom! I was excited to see their historical costumes, and their choreography was on point. Their movements and expressions were so powerful,\u201d Hsu said. Members of Kingdom leap synchronously, demonstrating their sharp choreography. The boy group performed \u201cAscension,\u201d \u201cEternity,\u201d \u201cBlack Crown,\u201d \u201cThe Song of Dann (Promise)\u201d and \u201cBlinder.\u201d (Photo by Michael Chow) After Kingdom\u2019s performance ended with \u201cBlinder,\u201d the anticipation in the crowd buzzed again. Students in the front row started chanting: \u201cKim Sejeong! Kim Sejeong!\u201d Then, against a backdrop of a field of pink flowers, Sejeong emerged onstage to the crowd cheering. Rather than opening energetically, Sejeong sang a sweet rendition of \u201cFlower Way.\u201d Because she had been acting in K-dramas like \u201cUncanny Counter\u201d and \u201cBusiness Proposal\u201d back-to-back, it had been months since Sejeong was last seen singing onstage. But for Huang, who has followed Sejeong since she was part of girl group I.O.I., it was as if she never took a break from singing. \u201cI\u2019m so used to seeing her on screens, like in music videos and on TV shows,\u201d Huang said. \u201cBut seeing her sing in person was surreal, like I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m seeing her so up close.\u201d Kim Sejeong sings \u201cLove, Maybe\u201d from the soundtrack of her drama, \u201cBusiness Proposal.\u201d She also sang \u201cFlower Way,\u201d \u201cSkyline\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s Go Home.\u201d (Photo by Chloe Chen) As Sejeong sang her versatile set of songs, her fans swayed and sang loudly along to the music, waving their flashlights and merchandise fans. Throughout the concert, Kingdom and Sejeong interacted with fans\u2019 heart gestures and shouting. The emcee even encouraged them to say \u201cfight on!\u201d to the crowd. That moment was memorable for Hsu. \u201cThe idols obviously always can\u2019t talk to everyone [in English],\u201d she said, \u201cso I think that was nice of them to try and be inclusive by acknowledging everyone as a USC Trojan.\u201d Kim Sejeong and the K-pop Festa emcee enthusiastically throw up victory signs and tell the audience, \u201cFight On!\u201d (Photo by Chloe Chen) These moments of genuine interactions between fans and artists are what makes K-pop so special. \u201cK-pop Festa was definitely successful in showing the uniqueness of K-pop and the culture of fan and idol interactions in the K-pop fandom,\u201d Huang said. Videos and pictures of these interactions were uploaded to Twitter and Instagram under trending phrases like \u201cKim Sejeong USC\u201d and \u201cKingdom USC\u201d that weekend. These posts helped Lee realize K-pop Festa\u2019s impact. \u201cThe excitement from students and TikTok comments who were jealous that we were able to do it just got me like, \u2018Wow, we were able to do something very meaningful,\u2019\u201d she said. Fans hold up signs, phones, cameras and light sticks to show their support for both Sejeong and Kingdom. (Photo by Michael Chow) In a time where anti-Asian hate crimes persist, Lee wanted to highlight the uniqueness of K-pop communities and celebrate Asian-ness. \u201cK-pop is truly global in the sense that it involves labor from so many countries, but it\u2019s also a cultural product from Korea and Asia,\u201d she said. \u201cThis event was really for the students, especially for the ones\u2026whose interest and whose culture have been ignored.\u201d At the end of the night, illuminated by multicolored lights, Sejeong performed \u201cLet\u2019s Go Home\u201d as a celebratory farewell to the crowd. Despite the upbeat encore, the farewell felt bittersweet to the fans. But unlike Sejeong, K-pop Festa itself has yet to go home. \u201cI\u2019m planning to do something again next year, but only if I get help,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWe got to do this again, especially for prospective students going to USC.\u201d 1 2 3 4 5 About Annenberg Media\n\n \u2022 \n\nContact Us \u2022 Get Involved uscannenbergmedia.com \u00a9 2023 USC Annenberg Media uscannenbergmedia.com \u00a9 2023 USC Annenberg Media ",
