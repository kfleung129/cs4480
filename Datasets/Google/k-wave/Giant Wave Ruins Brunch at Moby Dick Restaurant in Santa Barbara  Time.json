    "title": "Giant Wave Ruins Brunch at Moby Dick Restaurant in Santa Barbara | Time",
    "text": "A quiet Saturday brunch turned chaotic when a large wave crashed through restaurant windows, shattering glass and drenching the restaurant and customers with seawater. Several brunch goers were filming large waves rolling into the Moby Dick Restaurant at Stearns Wharf in Santa Barbara, when a particularly vicious one shattered the seaside windows. No major injuries were reported. The waves were thought to be especially large due to winter storms. You can watch the madness below. Contact us at letters@time.com. ",
