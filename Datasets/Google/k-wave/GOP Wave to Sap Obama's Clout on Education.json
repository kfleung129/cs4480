    "title": "GOP Wave to Sap Obama's Clout on Education",
    "text": "After midterm elections that vastly favored Republicans, President Barack Obama has far fewer allies in Congress and in states to champion his federal policy push on such priorities as teacher evaluation and common academic standards at a crucial stage in their implementation. At the state level, for example, the GOP surge means there will be more opponents of the Common Core State Standards in legislatures, and among state chiefs and governors, potentially threatening an initiative the Obama administration has backed with both money and regulatory incentives. At the federal level, the U.S. Senate\u2014which will shift to GOP control in January\u2014isn\u2019t likely to pass a bill to reauthorize the badly outdated Elementary and Secondary Education Act that closely resembles the administration\u2019s vision in areas like accountability and teacher quality.  With both chambers in Republican hands, the 114th Congress also is unlikely to give Secretary of Education Arne Duncan much more money for the kinds of competitive grants that have helped him carry his agenda forward\u2014leaving the U.S. Department of Education running short on political carrots. \u201cThe Obama administration has to rethink its whole approach,\u201d U.S. Rep. John Kline, R-Minn., the chairman of the House education committee, said in an interview this week. \u201cNow, if he wants to get anything done, he needs to talk with us.\u201d For his part, Mr. Obama said he plans to reach across the aisle. \u201cThe United States has big things to do, and we will make progress if we work together,\u201d the president said in a Nov. 5 press conference. He listed issues including early-childhood education and college access as potential starting points for negotiations with the new Congress. But Congress isn\u2019t likely to be the only roadblock for the administration. Secretary Duncan also doesn\u2019t have much juice left to work his will on states looking to receive waivers from provisions of the No Child Left Behind Act, the current version of the ESEA. That process offered more than 40 states and the District of Columbia relief from the much-maligned law if they adopted administration priorities in areas like tougher teacher evaluations, rigorous standards and aligned tests, and aggressive tactics for school turnarounds. State schools chiefs will have far fewer qualms about dismissing Mr. Duncan and his team, with whom they\u2019ve had to negotiate the finer points of accountability systems, said Vic Klatt, a former longtime aide to Republicans on the House education committee who is now a principal at the Penn Hill Group, a government-relations firm in Washington. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be very tough for them going forward,\u201d he said of Education Department officials. \u201cStates are going to feel much more comfortable ignoring the secretary and his staff on a whole range of issues.\u201d Still, Mr. Klatt wouldn\u2019t count the administration out, particularly on ESEA reauthorization. If any bill is get to the finish line, the White House and Senate Democrats will have to be on board, he said. What\u2019s more, the administration still has some regulatory arrows in its quiver, including the waiver-renewal process, and the ability to issue guidelines on everything from teacher training to for-profit colleges. In a sign of the Obama administration\u2019s already-waning clout at the state level, candidates for state schools chief who came out swinging against the common core generally trumped opponents who embraced the initiative. Opponents of the standards prevailed in state chiefs\u2019 races in Georgia, Oklahoma, and Wyoming, and in Arizona, the Republican, also a common-core opponent, was leading as of Thursday morning.  The common core was initially developed by a bipartisan cadre of state chiefs and governors. But the Obama administration promoted the standards through its Race to the Top grant program, and its No Child Left Behind waivers. President Obama even took credit for them on the campaign trail in 2012, giving the standards a decidedly blue, Democratic tint\u2014and prompting a backlash. Still, supporters of the standards don\u2019t see the midterm elections as a major blow to the effort. \u201cI feel pretty good,\u201d said Chris Minnich, the executive director of the Council of Chief State School Officers, which spearheaded the common-core initiative along with the National Governors Association. He noted that more than 40 states are still advancing the standards. \u201cI thought [the common core] could have been a factor in many more races,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were talking about many other things.\u201d The Obama administration also is unlikely to get much help on key priorities from some of the Democrats who were elected this week. In California, for example, Tom Torlakson, the teachers\u2019-union-backed incumbent in a closely watched race for state superintendent, beat back a strong challenge from Marshall Tuck, a former president of the Green Dot Public Schools network of charter schools in Los Angeles.  California has been something of thorn in Secretary Duncan\u2019s side. Mr. Torlakson and the president of the state school board, Michael Kirst, refused to write an NCLB waiver application that conformed to the administration\u2019s vision of teacher evaluation. And the chief deputy state superintendent, Richard Zeiger, has been openly celebrating California\u2019s decision to stay out of the waiver process. By contrast, Mr. Tuck, who had the support of groups that have strongly backed some of President Obama\u2019s policies\u2014including Democrats for Education Reform, or DFER, a high-profile political action committee\u2014said the Golden State should have played ball with the Education Department on waivers. Still, Mr. Tuck\u2019s supporters see the close race\u2014the two candidates were separated by just a few percentage points\u2014as a sign that issues such as rethinking teacher tenure and expanding charter schools can play well at the ballot box. And they see the momentum behind such policies as a big part of the Obama legacy. \u201cThe messages do matter,\u201d said Joe Williams, the executive director of DFER. \u201cThe moment President Obama emerged as a leader, it made it a lot easier in statehouses and in mayor\u2019s offices from coast to coast to have a lot of these conversations.\u201d For their part, Republicans who are active on education issues see reason for optimism in 2016, given the sheer number of governors with prominent records on K-12 policy who are plausible contenders for the GOP presidential nomination. Potential GOP candidates who fit that bill include Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a foe of teachers\u2019 unions and a champion of school choice who was easily re-elected this week; Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who has worked with Democrats on teacher-quality issues; former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a big supporter of the common core and school choice; and Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, who has made headlines recently for his opposition to the standards and his support for private school vouchers.  \u201cIt\u2019s not just \u2018Republicans did well,\u2019 \u201d said Andy Smarick, who served in the U.S. Department of Education during President George W. Bush\u2019s tenure, and as deputy state education commissioner in New Jersey and is now a partner at Bellwether Education Partners, a nonprofit consulting group in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Republicans who care deeply about education and have records did well.\u2019 \u201d \u201cI can\u2019t remember a time when there was a deeper bench of Republicans who could run for president who have that credential.\u201d Staff Writers Lauren Camera and Andrew Ujifusa contributed to this article.A version of this article appeared in the November 12, 2014 edition of Education Week as GOP Electoral Wave Expected to Roil K-12 Policy Waters ",
