View all partners A little over a year ago, South Korean singer PSY galloped onto the global pop circuit singing about \u201csexy ladies\u201d in the Seoul suburb of Gangnam. What followed were a flurry of articles (some going as far as to claim that PSY was offering a scathing critique of bourgeois South Koreans) introducing Western audiences to a formerly niche style of bubblegum pop called \u201cK(orea)-pop\u201d. Many of those articles focused on the more \u201cexotic\u201d and outrageous aspects of K-pop: its cute aesthetic, the gruelling dancing and singing training programme and the genre\u2019s association with plastic surgery. Though K-pop had its origins with hip-hop outfit Seo Taiji and Boys in the 1990s, and has achieved astronomical success in the Asian market since the so-called \u201cKorean Wave\u201d (Hallyu) in the 2000s, a middle-aged man with a novelty dance was what it took for K-pop to \u201cbreak\u201d with Western audiences. While the average listener may now be familiar with K-pop as a novel genre of global pop, K-pop\u2019s precursor \u2013 and sometimes rival \u2013 J(apan)-pop is less well known. Both proffer pop sung by impossibly good-looking young people, which ranges from sentimental ballads to highly-danceable tunes in Korean or Japanese, with a smattering of \u201ccool\u201d English words for good measure. PSY is actually anomalous in terms of K-pop. He is older, a solo artist and his music is more satirical than sentimental. But we need to understand both \u201cpops\u201d in terms of political scientist Joseph Nye\u2019s idea of \u201csoft power\u201d. In short, Nye argues that, alongside political-economic might, key to contemporary manifestations of national power is culture. He suggests cultural exports \u2013 such as food, fashion and music \u2013 are effective ideological vehicles. In the 1980s and 1990s, Japan\u2019s economy boomed. Key to this was a domination of the Asian pop music market. While Chinese, Singaporean and Malaysian consumers were wary of Japanese political clout following the Pacific War, the cute, catchy and apparently innocuous strains of Japanese pop music were seen as a \u201csafe\u201d mode of engaging with their formerly imperialist neighbour. Of course, territories such as Hong Kong had their own pop music industries (\u201cCanto-pop\u201d), but Japan was most successful in exporting its pop product. Unlike the gyrating rebelliousness of Western music, J-pop presented Asian consumers with a relatable \u201cAsian-ness\u201d that also appeared modern and cosmopolitan. J-pop was \u2013 and is \u2013 run in a similar manner to other Japanese companies. The jimusho (management agencies) are vertically structured, and pop hopefuls undergo a rigorous apprenticeship before \u201cdebuting\u201d in their mid to late teens. J-pop stars are not simply singers: they are also accomplished dancers and often appear in Japanese soap operas, variety shows and even cooking programmes. 1990s J-pop aidoru (idols) such as SMAP and Wink garnered fans in Japan, but also in other Asian countries. But Korea restricted imports of Japanese goods due to the fraught historical relationship between the nations. Instead, Korea developed its own popular music industry, spearheaded by the management agency SM Entertainment. Koreans flocked to buy albums by boy bands Seo Taiji and H.O.T. K-pop\u2019s musical style was similar to J-pop, as was the arrangement of the management agencies. Further, as with J-pop, K-pop was focused on cultivating a pan-Asian market. In particular, SM and its main competitors, YG and JYP, targetted Japanese consumers. In a novel move, K-pop producers diversified their product to suit local markets. Crucially, K-pop stars, such as female idol B.o.A, were trained in Japanese language and \u201cculture\u201d. B.o.A. would release two versions of her songs \u2013 in Korean and Japanese. In the early 2000s, Korean pop music began to dominate the Japanese charts. K-pop has further localised its music by training singers in Mandarin, Thai and, more recently, English. In a similarly market savvy move, K-pop \u201csuper groups\u201d (often with ten or more members) have local \u201cfranchises\u201d made up of mostly non-Korean members. Super Junior, for example, one of K-pop\u2019s most successful boy bands, has local language franchises in China and Taiwan. Arguably, the \u201cKorean wave\u201d has been a more effective device of soft power than the \u201cJapan boom\u201d. While J-pop groups ruled the Asian market in the 1980s and 1990s, they never \u201ccracked\u201d the West. K-pop idols \u2013 PSY aside \u2013 on the other hand, have had some success overseas. Super Junior visited Sydney in 2012 and attracted a large crowd. Further, auxiliary cultural products, such as Korean food, fashion and language classes, have surged in popularity. Like J-pop, K-pop has a formalised fan-club system. Each group of fans has a \u201ctitle\u201d and even colour. Super Junior fans are known as \u201cEverlasting Friends\u201d (ELFs). Their colour is \u201cpearl sapphire blue\u201d. Fans network online from around the world and often pool together money to buy extravagant gifts for their idols. The cuteness and apparent innocuousness of cultural products is key to soft power. While ELFs brandishing pearl sapphire blue balloons and buying iPods for their idols may seem silly, K-pop\u2019s revenue was US$ 3.4 billion in 2011, of which US$180 million was exports. While \u201cGangnam Style\u201d was a novelty hit, the business and cultural politics behind Korean and Japanese pop music is far more serious. Copyright \u00a9 2010\u20132023, The Conversation ",
