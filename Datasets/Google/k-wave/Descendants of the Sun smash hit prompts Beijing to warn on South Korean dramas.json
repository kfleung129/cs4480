At the heart of the ministry's complaint is a 16-episode drama  called \"Descendants of the Sun\", which premiered in South Korea  and China in February, smashing ratings and dominating trending  topics on Weibo, China's answer to Twitter. \"Watching Korean dramas could be dangerous, and may even lead to  legal troubles,\" the ministry warned in a Weibo post at the  weekend. The department then cited some real-life cases of domestic  violence, divorce and plastic surgery, all of which it related to  an obsession with Korean dramas and accompanied with photos of  similar incidents from various Korean television series. Many Weibo users took the ministry's post with a pinch of salt. \"This isn't the fault of Korean drama but has to do with IQ,\" one  Weibo user commented. Another added, \"Although I don't like  Korean dramas but these are all individual cases. [Those  involved] lack IQ.\" The huge success of \"Descendants of the Sun\" is the latest  example of Hallyu, which means Korean Wave, and refers to the growing popularity of South  Korean pop culture. And the public security ministry's warnings are not without some  grounds in previous Korean drama-induced lunacy. In 2014, another hit South Korean series, \"My Love from the  Star,\" sparked such a craze in China for Korean fried chicken  that a pregnant woman reportedly almost suffered a miscarriage  after chowing down on fried chicken and beer \u2013 the food favored  by the lead actress in the series. And earlier this month, a 20-year-old Chinese woman was  reportedly diagnosed with acute glaucoma after an 18-hour Korean  drama binge-watching session. The cautionary post from a ministry in China underscores the  growing influence of Korean pop culture in China and the enormous  economic opportunities that have emerged  from Hallyu in the past decade. Amid a global slowdown, South Korea is banking on its tourism and  service industry to prop up its economy. And a state-backed  entertainment push has gained traction in Asia, with China  proving to be a lucrative market. To cater to Chinese viewers, the entire series of \"Descendants of  the Sun\" was pre-recorded so that it could be cleared in advance  by Chinese censors, allowing it to be broadcast simultaneously in  both countries. This was in contrast with the \"live-shoot\" system  that Korean dramas typically follow, with episodes being filmed  as previously recorded episodes are aired, so that script  adjustments can be made according to ratings. The gamble has paid off, with \"Descendants of the Sun\" passing  400 million views on the Chinese online video platform, iQiyi.  Ratings in South Korea have hit 30 percent, which means three in ten people viewing television during the timeslot were watching the TV drama. The drama, a romance set against military operations in a  fictional country, has also spurred interest in cosmetics,  smartphones and fashion products featured in the show. Chinese investors, unsurprisingly,have been keen to cash in on  the Hallyu phenomenon, which was estimated to  have been worth 12.6 trillion won ($10.6 billion) in 2014,  according to official South Korean figures cited by the Korea  JoongAng Daily newspaper. News agency Yonhap reported in January that official figures  showed that Chinese investors had injected 3 trillion won ($2.5  billion) into the South Korean games, movie and entertainment  sectors over the past five years. The investments come as China seeks to build soft power in the  region. In 2014, following the success of \"My Love from the Star,\"  China's political advisory body, the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Congress  (CPPC) lamented the fact that China  could not produce as big a hit of its own, reported The Washington Post then. CPPC delegates reportedly viewed the popularity of the  Korean drama as a blow to Chinese confidence in their own culture, reported state-run Xinhua  news agency.
