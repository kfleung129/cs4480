But no one can be complacent about this pandemic. Life goes on in Italy. Italy was a symbol of the first wave of the pandemic. It was the first country in the world to go into a national lockdown, as its hospitals \u2014 especially in cities such as Bergamo and Cremona in the north \u2014 struggled to cope with the spike of cases and there was a sharp increase in deaths. As fear of a second wave grips Europe, Italy appears to be coping much better than other countries such as France, Spain and the U.K. This is hardly a time for complacency; as Britain can attest, this virus can return with a vengeance. But over the last two weeks, Italy recorded slightly fewer than 35 cases per 100,000 inhabitants \u2014 compared to nearly 315 in Spain, almost 200 in France and 76.5 in the U.K. The number of average deaths stood at 0.3 per 100,000, a third of the French rate and nearly a tenth of Spain\u2019s. Italy\u2019s figures are only marginally worse than Germany\u2019s, which has been praised  as a model of sound pandemic management. ",
