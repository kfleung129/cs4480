    "text": "By \n\n\tAmy X. Wang As the K-pop phenomenon \u2014 also known as the Korean Wave or\u00a0hallyu \u2014\u00a0sweeps the globe\u00a0at a unprecedented pace, there\u2019s greater interest among new audiences in how exacting and meticulous the industry can be with its musicians. One illustrative case of that is the firing this week of two stars who breached a tacit rule about romantic relationships. HyunA and E\u2019Dawn, two K-pop stars managed by Cube Entertainment, one of the South Korean entertainment companies that oversees the entire K-pop scene, revealed last month during a promotion of a joint new album that they have been dating for two years. Their promotion tour was quickly cut short and E\u2019Dawn went on hiatus from his boy band Pentagon. On Thursday, Cube \u2014 which has denied any relationship between the couple whenever past rumors emerged \u2014 announced in a statement that \u201cwhen we manage artists, we consider mutual trust and faith our top priority\u201d and as a result, \u201cwe decided the trust is broken beyond repair, so we are expelling the two from our company.\u201d  What may seem like extreme micromanagement to uninitiated music fans is actually par for the course in the K-pop scene. Because South Korea\u2019s entertainment companies carefully design every aspect of their artists\u2019 lives from their performances to their public personalities, unplanned romantic relationships are seen as off-course detriments to a group or star\u2019s appeal.\u00a0Some K-pop stars are required to sign contracts against dating anyone that their agencies deem inappropriate, or dating anyone at all. And there is some truth to the companies\u2019 worries about artists stepping out of their image blueprints: Extreme fans sometimes feel invested enough in stars\u2019 personal relationships so as to issue\u00a0death threats. Such intense fan devotion is in a part a reflection of how committed most K-pop stars are themselves. \u201cK-pop is not just music, but a total performance, a cultural movement and lifestyle turned into a seductive spectacle,\u201d Suk-Young Kim, a UCLA critical studies professor who has written a book on the genre\u2019s broadening appeal outside of Asia, tells\u00a0Rolling Stone.\u00a0She adds that K-pop idols\u2019 \u201cspectacular visual presentation\u201d both on and off the stage, which requires a level of unerring rigor that is not seen in Western artists, is a big reason it\u2019s become so fascinating for American fans. The case of HyunA and E\u2019Dawn also highlights another major facet of K-pop, though: the collective power of its unceasing fan base. On Thursday, thousands of K-pop fans protested the two stars\u2019 firing on social media \u2014 and the backlash was so swift and fierce that hours after its first announcement, Cube came out with\u00a0another statement saying that the situation is not yet final. \u201cWe\u2019re discussing the issue, but it\u2019s not confirmed,\u201d CEO\u00a0Shin Dae-nam said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a board meeting next week to discuss the issue.\u201d We want to hear it.
