Photo: SM Entertainment SINGAPORE \u2014 The MBC Korean Music Wave in Singapore 2013 has been cancelled \u2014  just 10 days before the event, billed as the biggest-ever K-Pop concert, is due to be held. In a statement posted tonight (Nov 6) on the event\u2019s Facebook page, concert organiser Fatfish Entertainment said it was cancelled \u201cdue to unforeseen circumstances including contractual difficulties with our co-producer, MBC\u201d. \u201cThis is an unexpected turn of events and we are ascertaining how this cancellation will affect our financial position,\u201d it added. This announcement came about a week after Fatfish issued an apology for requesting for donations for the concert\u2019s fan-supported projects, including food and transport subsidies. In that Facebook post, which appears to have been deleted, the company announced that it would \u201cno longer wish to continue with the fan-support projects\u201d, and apologised to the Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (MBC), one of South Korea\u2019s largest TV stations, and the artists \u201cif our actions have affected their reputation\u201d. The three-hour extravaganza, jointly organised by MBC and Singapore-based Fatfish Entertainment and presented by StarHub, was to have been held at the Gardens By The Bay on Nov 16. Fatfish had previously announced that the concert would be hosted by Korean girl group Girls\u2019 Generation\u2019s Taeyeon, Tiffany and Seohyun (TaeTiSeo), and feature acts including SHINee, EXO, 2PM, 2AM, F.T. Island, B1A4, TeenTop, B.A.P, Kara, Sistar, Miss A, IU and 4Minute. In a statement tonight, Ms Wang Li-Na, Head of Consumer Marketing, StarHub, said: \u201cWe were very disappointed to learn this evening, from the concert promoter, Fatfish Entertainment, that the MBC Korean MusicWave concert has been cancelled. We are currently in talks with them to find out more.\u201d Fatfish\u2019s post on Facebook attracted hundreds of comments from disappointed fans, who bought tickets ranging from S$168 to S$688, less than an hour after the statement was posted. \u201cIt\u2019s so unprofessional of you to announce at such a short notice when the event is just 10 days away ... Ticket prices were unreasonably sky-high, which caused you guys to have poor sales,\u201d said fan Mira Jamil. Fatfish Entertainment says it is currently seeking professional advice on how the company can refund ticket holders and other creditors. In September, organisers of The 1 World Festival \u2014 also citing \u201cunforseen circumstances\u201d \u2014 announced that it would be cancelled just two days before opening night on Sept 20.
