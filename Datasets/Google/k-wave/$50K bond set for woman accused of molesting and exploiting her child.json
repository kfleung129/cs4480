    "text": "JEFFERSONVILLE, IN (WAVE) - A woman charged with molesting and exploiting her child and then selling the photos online has made her initial court appearance. Jaime L. Simms remained silent as she walked into and out of a Clark County courtroom Thursday to face charges of child molestation, child exploitation and possession of child pornography. >> MUGSHOTS: April 2018 Roundup Police were contacted after the father found videos\u00a0on Simms' phone of her molesting and exploiting her daughter. Simms confessed to police and told them she recorded the videos to sell so she could get money for her drug habit. Simms told police she thought\u00a0she received around $200 from the videos that she sold online. \"It's a case where a 3-year-old who was asleep was taken advantage of by an adult,\" Clark County Prosecutor Jeremy Mull said. \"In this particular\u00a0case, the allegation is that the defendant filmed the child abuse/child molestation that was occurring and then did distribute the video of that molestation on apps or websites that included Kik, Reddit and a something known as Omegle.\" PREVIOUS STORY+\u00a0Police: Mom videotaped molestation of daughter, sold pics for drug money If convicted, Mull said Simms could face more than 20 years in prison for the four charges facing her. Mull also said he will push for a high amount of jail time to be served because of the way Simms allegedly abused her child to fuel her drug habit. One of Simms' co-workers who was at the hearing told WAVE 3 News that Simms had a good paying job and had refused money from him the week before. The co-worker said he didn't think this was about paying for drugs but instead a kind of gratification\u00a0she was getting from selling the videos. He said he was shocked by the allegations facing Simms, someone he's known and worked with for years.
