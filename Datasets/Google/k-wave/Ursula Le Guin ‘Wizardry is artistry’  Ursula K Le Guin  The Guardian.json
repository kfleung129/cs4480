    "text": "As Ursula Le Guin receives the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters at the National Book Awards, she talks to Hari Kunzru about alternative fictional worlds Ursula K Le Guin\u2019s speech at National Book Awards: \u2018Books aren\u2019t just commodities\u2019 Ursula Le Guin cries freedom as she is honoured for contribution to literature Ursula K Le Guin lives along a winding road in a suburb of Portland, Oregon. Walking uphill towards her house I find the way spectacularly blocked. A bridge is being rebuilt and the road is broken by a steep drop, forcing me to pick my way along a trail down into a ravine, then back up the other side. This small detour feels auspicious. There ought to be more adventure on such a journey than an airport security queue and a taxi rank. I am resisting the temptation to use the language of the quest here, or get into any dubious comparisons between writers and wizards or witches. I didn\u2019t have to change myself into a hawk or cross over into the land of the dead. I have rarely gone to visit a writer bearing so many messages of love and admiration. People want to thank Le Guin. Many readers discover her young, through her Earthsea sequence, now acknowledged as one of the great works of 20th-century fantasy. This week, 40 years after the third Earthsea book, The Farthest Shore, won the National Book award in children\u2019s literature, Le Guin has been awarded the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, presented to her by Neil Gaiman in New York. One of my friends, a Le Guin fan of great depth and seriousness, remembers being nine years old, in pain and distress as he recovered from open-heart surgery. \u201cReading the Earthsea trilogy saved my life,\u201d he wrote to me. I don\u2019t think he was being altogether rhetorical. Escape is derided as the cheapest of literary pleasures, \u201cescapism\u201d the name for a particular kind of aesthetic cowardice, a culpable flight from the real. But there are situations when what you need is teleportation. You need to get out of the surgical ward. You need to stay in Earthsea for as long as your imagination can float its little open boat. \u201cHe\u2019s more than welcome,\u201d Le Guin says, when I relay my friend\u2019s thanks. In person she is tiny. The unwary might mistake her simply for the genial 84-year-old wife of a retired academic, a cat owner, who has lived quietly in the same house for half a century. Perhaps it takes a certain kind of temperament to absorb so much devotion and retain equanimity. A fierce, waspish energy animates her as she listens and speaks, but for a writer she seems strikingly unneedy. She frequently talks about herself as an object of wry or amused discovery. \u201cApparently,\u201d she will say, \u201cI don\u2019t mind living in the margins, because I\u2019ve put myself there often enough. Apparently, I never sought moral guidance in religion,\u201d as if her past is a kind of text, from which she is only now making these deductions. In an astonishing run in the late 1960s and early 70s, Le Guin produced not just Earthsea but several of the great novels of science fiction\u2019s postwar new wave. The Lathe of Heaven, The Dispossessed, The Word for World Is Forest and The Left Hand of Darkness fulfilled the genre\u2019s promise, using speculation to address social, political, ethical and metaphysical questions. Since then she has continued to publish novels and short stories informed by the mystical philosophy of the Tao Te Ching and the west coast tradition of political radicalism, written in a clear, clean prose that is never tainted by inkhorn medievalism or technological jargon. A two-volume collection of stories, The Unreal and the Real, was published this summer, giving an overview of her entire career. Because of her subject matter, Le Guin isn\u2019t always recognised for what she is, one of the great writers of the American west, a product of a coastal tradition that looks forward at the Pacific with a wilderness at its back and the great cities of Europe very far to the rear. Le Guin claims to \u201cget very uppity\u201d about the \u201cparochialism and snobbishness\u201d of the East Coast literary establishment. \u201cThe idea that everybody lives in a large city in the east, it\u2019s such a strange thing for an American to think.\u201d She grew up in Berkeley, the daughter of Alfred Kroeber, one of the major figures in US anthropology. Her mother was Theodora Kroeber, who became well known in the 1960s, around the time of her daughter\u2019s first fame, as the author of popular books about Ishi, the last survivor of the Yahi tribe, who had lived as her husband\u2019s ward in the early years of the century. Alfred, a student of the \u201cfather of American anthropology\u201d Franz Boas, gathered and preserved information about native peoples and traditions in California, excavated archaeological sites in Mexico and Peru, and some years before his daughter\u2019s birth had briefly practised as a psychoanalyst. The family home was a magnet for displaced European emigres, many of them anthropologists. Le Guin remembers dozens of intellectuals \u201cin and out of the house\u201d. Many of her earliest stories are set in a fictional middle European country she called Orsinia, like her own name a derivation of the Latin for bear. Summers were spent in the Napa Valley, not then the manicured hub of boutique agribusiness it is today. \u201cIt was much more like a valley in Provence or Italy. Olives and plums and apricots and grapes. They grew everything. Lots of small farms, Italian family farms. North Italians came there because they recognised it, they knew what to do with that land.\u201d In a \u201cwild and hairy\u201d farmhouse, the Kroebers would also play host to the Native American subjects of Alfred\u2019s research, giving the young Ursula \u201can experience that a great many American kids don\u2019t have, of knowing people really from somewhere else\u201d. Her father was one of the pioneers of \u201ccultural relativism\u201d, a theory that was to have huge influence on the progressive politics of the late 20th century. The notion that desires and moral values may be culturally specific was enormously challenging to a Victorian intellectual framework that dealt in universal hierarchies. For a nation that was just mopping up after a 300-year genocide, the thought that the people they had eradicated weren\u2019t inferior but different was (and remains) unwelcome. Le Guin\u2019s fiction is littered with moments of cultural contact, and heroes who approach the unfamiliar with an open mind and a desire to learn. How much of this perspective was learned in the family home? \u201cIt\u2019s got to be partly nurture,\u201d Le Guin allows, \u201cbut I really wonder if it\u2019s partly nature, too, if I simply inherited something like my father\u2019s temperament.\u201d I put it to her that humility before otherness is always a signal virtue in her fiction. \u201cIt\u2019s great curiosity also,\u201d she says. \u201cYou want to know. You want to go and be there.\u201d The Word for World Is Forest, published in 1972, is clearly a product of this view. The book is a response to the Vietnam war, to which Le Guin was vehemently opposed. In a 2008 interview with the novelist Alexander Chee, she remembered writing it in London, where she and her husband were spending a sabbatical year. \u201cI was unable to protest my country\u2019s increasing involvement by non-violent action. My frustrated anger and shame went pretty directly into the book.\u201d The planet Athshe, an Edenic forest world, is the site of New Tahiti, a human logging colony. The humans have casually enslaved the inhabitants, who are peaceful, physically slight, with a subsistence-level material culture. The narrative pits Captain Davidson \u2013 a violent exploiter whose rape and murder of a native woman sparks a revolt in the hominids he derisively calls \u201ccreechies\u201d\u2013 against anthropologist Raj Lyubov, who becomes a kind of species traitor as he discovers more about the nature of the native relationship to the forest. The anthropologist is despised by the military commander because he appears content to be in the world, to try to understand without altering it or bending it to his will. Lyubov, precisely because he is mindful and aware, realises that Athshe\u2019s inhabitants, stigmatizsed as lazy and work-shy, actually spend part of their \u201cwaking\u201d time in a state of lucid dreaming. If this reminds you of James Cameron\u2019s 2009 blockbuster Avatar, you\u2019re not alone (though the aliens in the film are large and blue rather than small and green). In Le Guin\u2019s opinion, Cameron \u201chad quite a few people to thank\u201d for inspiring his story, but \u201che dodged all that\u201d. Likewise she thinks JK Rowling \u201ccould have been more generous\u201d in acknowledging A Wizard of Earthsea (1968), a novel in which a young boy attends a school for wizards and attracts the attention of metaphysical dark forces. Though Le Guin is certainly a famous writer, she is probably not as famous as she ought to be, and these days her influence is mainly felt indirectly. Her novels, like Ray Bradbury\u2019s short story about cultural assimilation, \u201cDark They Were and Golden Eyed\u201d, and Robert Heinlein\u2019s novel Stranger in a Strange Land were among the dog-eared paperbacks that passed hand to hand in squats and communes across the US, as SF became one of the unacknowledged intellectual drivers of the counterculture. As she writes in her 1997 translation of the Tao Te Ching \u201ctrue leaders/ are hardly known to their followers \u2026 when the work\u2019s done right/ with no fuss or boasting/ ordinary people say/ Oh, we did it.\u201d Le Guin\u2019s engagement with Taoism underpins The Lathe of Heaven (1971). It\u2019s set in a dystopian version of Portland in 2002, where George Orr arrives in the consulting room of Dr William Heber, an ambitious psychiatrist. Orr has been trying to avoid sleeping because he believes his dreams are \u201ceffective\u201d and can alter the course of events. Heber, at first understandably sceptical, comes to believe in Orr\u2019s power and makes disastrous attempts to harness it, producing a series of increasingly appalling realities. George Orr has a logical operator for a surname, because his mind is a garden of forking paths. The book produces a state of radical uncertainty, as the city outside the psychiatrist\u2019s window changes with each waking. Does Le Guin believe that dreams have such power? \u201cNo, except insofar as they are obviously the dark parts of one\u2019s mind operating, and we do affect the world. I\u2019m not a lucid dreamer; I think my dreams are quite ordinary.\u201d The title The Lathe of Heaven is an artefact of a 19th-century translation of the Zhuangzi (Chuang-Tzu), the collection of anecdotes and parables traditionally attributed to the Taoist sage Zhuang Zhou, the best known of which features a sage who doesn\u2019t know whether he has dreamed of being a butterfly, or is a butterfly dreaming he is a man. \u201cTo let understanding stop at what cannot be understood is a high attainment. Those who cannot do it will be destroyed on the lathe of heaven.\u201d Heber\u2019s hubristic desire for control is, in Taoist terms, evidence of lack of spiritual attainment. It makes him a monster of a less obvious kind than the colonial overseer Davidson, but a monster nonetheless. After The Lathe of Heaven was published, Le Guin was contacted by a sinologist who informed her that her source for the title was inaccurate \u2013 the 1891 James Legge translation she was using had many problems: for one thing, the lathe had not been invented at the time of the Zhuangzi\u2019s composition. Le Guin brushed away this disappointing news. \u201cAt least I got a good title out of it.\u201d Le Guin had first discovered the Tao Te Ching as a teenager, and her own version (\u201ca rendition, not a translation\u201d) was the result of many years of wrestling with the obscurities of this terse, enigmatic text. \u201cMy father had a copy of Paul Carus\u2019s translation. It has the whole Chinese text with transliteration and literal translation. You realise that a single word can be two or three different words in English. I think I was 14, 15, the age when you\u2019re beginning to look around for religious guidance or whatever you want to call it. I found in it the thoughts I wanted to think, I guess. Much later I stumbled into pacifist anarchism. I thought I must educate myself about non-violence, so I read Gandhi and branched out from there.\u201d Le Guin\u2019s self-education ultimately took the form of The Dispossessed (1974), one of the most fully realised visions of a functioning anarchist society in literature. The novel is set on the planet Urras and its moon Anarres. Centuries earlier, to forestall a revolution, the Urrasti allowed anarchist sectarians to settle on the moon, giving them a guarantee of non-interference. The two societies have developed separately, with little contact. Anarres has become a place without authoritarian institutions or a conception of private property, while Urras has many states and ideologies, broadly reflecting the various alignments of the cold war period in which the book was written. \u201cWhat did I know about Utopia?\u201d she reminisced in a 1976 essay about the book. \u201cScraps of More, fragments of Wells, Hudson, Morris. Nothing.\u201d Looking for models, she took assistance from \u201cEngels, Marx, Godwin, Goldman, Goodman and above all Shelley and Kropotkin\u201d. One of Le Guin\u2019s great imaginative strengths is, paradoxically, her dislike of whimsy, and The Dispossessed considers many un-Utopian practicalities \u2013 who sleeps where, who looks after the children, how work is assigned and performed and compensated. The book still circulates widely in activist circles, and young anarchists often find their way to its author, hoping for political advice. These encounters make her \u201cembarrassed and a bit guilty\u201d, because one of her conclusions from writing the book was that \u201cthe only way it can be done\u201d \u2013\u201cit\u201d being the full implementation of an anarchist system of social organisation \u2013 \u201cis to be completely isolated from everybody else. Then it will probably all the same destroy itself from inside, because we are perverse creatures. But it was a lovely thing to follow through in a novel, as an intellectual framework for a book. Which is really what anarchism was to me, a way of thinking, a way of imagining, but not a belief.\u201d The \u201cdispossessed\u201d of Anarres are, of course, those who attempt to live without property, but also without a certain kind of language. They have no possessive pronouns (not \u201cyou can borrow my handkerchief\u201d, but \u201cyou can share the handkerchief I use\u201d) and abjure possessive sexuality. \u201cThe language Shevek spoke, the only one he knew, lacked any proprietary idioms for the sexual act \u2026 The usual verb, taking only a plural subject \u2026 meant something two people did, not something one person did, or had.\u201d Like much of Le Guin\u2019s writing, this is marked by her engagement with the women\u2019s movement, and the notion that a patriarchal language will produce a patriarchal world. The Left Hand of Darkness (1969), probably Le Guin\u2019s most celebrated work, is a novel that follows a human emissary to a winter planet whose inhabitants spend most of their time as asexual \u201cpotentials\u201d, only adopting gender during a period of sexual receptivity known as \u201ckemmer\u201d. Le Guin follows trains of thought about sexual desire, gender identities and parenting. Like The Dispossessed, it was, she has written, \u201ca thought experiment \u2026 Because of our lifelong social conditioning, it is hard for us to see clearly what, besides purely physiological form and function, truly differentiates men and women.\u201d The novel has become a classic not just because of its themes, resonant though they have proved to be. Le Guin has a commitment to world-building, to constructing her unreal cities along scrupulously realist lines. In an excoriating review of On Such a Full Sea, Chang-Rae Lee\u2019s recent foray into dystopian SF, she lists various faults of logic and plausibility, charging him with being just another literary tourist, one of a crowd of mainstream writers who have dabbled in the genre without paying their dues. \u201cNeglect of such literal, rational questions in imaginative fiction is often excused, even legitimised, as literary licence. Because the author is known as a literary writer, he will probably be granted the licence he takes. But social science fiction is granted no such irresponsibility \u2026 Like Cormac McCarthy and others, Lee uses essential elements of a serious genre irresponsibility, superficially.\u201d \u201cI hated to do that,\u201d says Le Guin of delivering this stinging rebuke. I half-believe her. Speculative fiction\u2019s commitment to plausible, coherent world-building is often overlooked (or even attacked) by critics , and Le Guin would hardly be the first SF writer to feel irritated that the difficulty of her craft was underrated. Of course, her preference for coherent, consistent worlds is not prescriptive. She has termed SF \u201ca crazy, protean, left-handed monkey wrench\u201d, a fictional tool that \u201ccan be put to any use the craftsman has in mind \u2013 satire, extrapolation, prediction, absurdity, exactitude, exaggeration, warning, message-carrying, tale-telling, whatever you like\u201d. Throwing the ultimate insult back at its detractors, she has also remarked that \u201cfake realism is the escapism of our time\u201d. She is not, for example, a fan of John Updike, though at the time of my visit she was reading and enjoying Arnold Bennett. Le Guin may be able to produce effective dreams, escape routes for the reader, but she is not an escapist. Her writing walks towards reality, not away from it. For all its furniture of spells and dragons, her Earthsea trilogy has something pithy and solid about it, something defiantly unwhimsical. In Earthsea, magic is predicated on naming, on knowing the \u201ctrue name\u201d of a person, place or thing. Her wizards attempt a sort of disclosure of the world as it is, rather than a flight from it. Le Guin has observed that \u201cwizardry is artistry. The trilogy is, in this sense, about art, the creative experience, the creative process.\u201d Le Guin\u2019s own creativity has barely slowed over the years. In the noughties she wrote a trilogy (Gifts, Voices and Powers) that was marketed as teen paranormal fiction, thus ensuring it missed much of its audience. Her last novel, Lavinia, in which she adopts the voice of a minor character in the Aeneid, appeared in 2008, and since then she has published stories, essays and poetry. In The Farthest Shore (1972), the third part of the Earthsea sequence, the mage Sparrowhawk offers a quasi-Taoist lesson in ethics to a young prince, as they sail a small open boat into the west: On every act the balance of the whole depends. The winds and seas, the powers of water and earth and light, all that these do, and all that the beasts and green things do, is well done, and rightly done. All these act within the Equilibrium. From the hurricane and the great whale\u2019s sounding to the fall of a dry leaf and the gnat\u2019s flight, all they do is done within the balance of the whole. But we, in so far as we have power over the world and over one another, we must learn to do what the leaf and the whale and the wind do of their own nature. We must learn to keep the balance. Having intelligence, we must not act in ignorance. Having choice, we must not act without responsibility. Or, as Le Guin put it to me: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to create a world out of whole cloth, that is to say, out of words, then you better get the words right.\u201d ",
