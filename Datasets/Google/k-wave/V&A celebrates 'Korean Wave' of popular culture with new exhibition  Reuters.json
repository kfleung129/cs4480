    "text": "LONDON, Sept 21 (Reuters) - From the bright pink guard costumes in hit Netflix series \"Squid Game\" to a large sculpture of rapper G-Dragon, London's V&A museum is celebrating South Korean popular culture and its rise to global prominence in a new exhibition opening this week. Among the items on display at \"Hallyu! The Korean Wave\" are K-Pop costumes, K-drama props as well as a replica of the bathroom set in Oscar-winning film \"Parasite\". \"This exhibition is actually celebrating the vibrant and colourful popular culture from South Korea from its inception to its place on the global stage,\" curator Rosalie Kim told Reuters at a preview on Wednesday. \"'Hallyu' actually means Korean wave and it refers to this meteoric rise of popular culture from South Korea that has taken the world by storm in the past few decades.\" The exhibition is split into different sections including K-pop and its fans, television drama and cinema, fashion and beauty.
