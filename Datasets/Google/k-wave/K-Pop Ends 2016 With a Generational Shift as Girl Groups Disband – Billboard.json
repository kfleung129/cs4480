It was no different for fans of Korean girl groups, thanks to the onslaught of devastating group breakups. Rather than fading away over a few years, almost an entire generation of Korea\u2019s girl groups went by the wayside overnight, as major players, including 2NE1 and Kara, sank into the rearview.

The quintet released their first song in 2007, and rose to fame as figureheads of the Korean Wave \u2014 the phenomena of Korean pop culture spreading internationally \u2014 during the early 2010s. Their infectious synth-pop hits, like \u201cWanna\u201d and \u201cMister,\u201d helped the group lead K-pop\u2019s push into Japan, the second largest music market in the world. They became the first Korean girl group to headline concert at the Tokyo Dome in 2013, and tickets reportedly sold out in five minutes. Kara\u2019s presence in the first half of the decade was undeniably impactful, and their conclusion set the tone for 2016, when it seemed like many of K-pop\u2019s most prominent girl groups said their final, relatively quiet, farewells.   K-pop\u2019s next shake up came in April, when 2NE1\u2019s Minzy left the group. The youngest of the foursome, Minzy didn\u2019t renew her contract with YG Entertainment, and set off to pursue a solo career. The move came two years after the group went on hiatus, following an instance where member Park Bom drew criticism for importing prescription drugs from the United States, despite their illegality in South Korea. Even though it was a lengthy absence, 2NE1\u2019s immense popularity seemed infallible and though Minzy\u2019s departure this year came as a shock to many, it appeared to mostly signal the start of a new era for the group. This was 2NE1; the quartet that turned K-pop\u2019s idea of \u201cgirl group\u201d inside out with empowering messages and bold performances. Surely it was not the end.  However, fans\u2019 enduring belief in 2NE1 was destroyed in November, when YG Entertainment quietly announced through a notice on the company\u2019s website that the group would be no more. (The announcement has since been removed.) The news came after the remaining three members informed fans that they\u2019d be releasing new music, and was met with confusion. CL and Dara, the only members to remain under YG, each expressed regret about not being able to deliver a new album, but 2NE1\u2019s legacy appeared to be cut short before the long-awaited music could be released. Since their debut in 2009, the fierce group had a revolutionary career and became one of the most dominant acts with hits like \u201cI Am The Best\u201d and \u201cLonely.\u201d Their final album, 2014\u2019s Crush, appeared at no. 60 on the Billboard 200. The K-pop industry\u2019s seven-year-long contracts was the immediate factor behind 2NE1\u2019s disbandment but the so-called \u201cseven-year curse\u201d affected several other female acts, including Kara\u2019s little sister group Rainbow. The group reached their peak in 2010 and 2011 with hits \u201cA\u201d and \u201cTo Me\u201d but were never truly able to find their place amidst the cutthroat industry. Their final single, the retro-tinged pop/rock song \u201cWhoo,\u201d came out in February, but the group survived until October, when their contracts with DSP Media expired.   Another loss came from 4Minute, who made their way in the K-pop scene with subversive dancepop. The group released \u201cHate\u201d in January ahead of their contracts expiring with Cube Entertainment but the empowering swan song didn\u2019t save the group. In June, 4Minute officially disbanded with only member and soloist HyunA remaining signed to the label. (Labelmates BEAST also left Cube this year, leaving major gaps in the company\u2019s roster.) While 4Minute never became as internationally renowned as some other K-pop acts \u2014 including HyunA herself after she appeared in Psy\u2019s \u201cGangnam Style\u201d video \u2014 they had numerous hits in South Korea and their 2015 EP Crazy, with its electronic and hip-hop title track, topped the World Album Chart. While there were plenty of groups that went the way of the past, the generational shift isn\u2019t entirely complete. Secret and miss A lost members this year but are still around, while Girls\u2019 Generation and Wonder Girls are still some of K-pop\u2019s most stalwart acts. But the winds are shifting, and the departing acts did leave openings for newer girl groups to fill in the void. Some of the year\u2019s most popular K-pop songs came from rising acts like Blackpink, Gfriend and Twice, ensuring that 2017 will see clashes as contenders face off to be crowned the top girl groups of this ascendant generation.
