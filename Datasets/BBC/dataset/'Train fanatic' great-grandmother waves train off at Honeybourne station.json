I like the Flying Scotsman and I'm also a big fan of the GWR trains which go up to Worcester Shrub Hill - they go great guns.\"Ms Gardner, from Upton Snodsbury, near Worcester, who has five children, 20 grandchildren and 24 great-grandchildren, said she grew up around trains and railways.Her father worked in a nearby shunting yard and one of her brothers was a stoker.She said helping to clean the royal train was a treat as it was so exciting.\"There was always lots of excitement whenever the royal train came in with the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh on board,\" she said.\"We were allowed to clean the top half of the train and it really was something to look forward to.\"Now in a wheelchair, she said she planned several things to do on her bucket list because she was \"getting older and there's still lots of things I'd like to do\".\"I enjoy playing [train simulator video games] on the laptop and taking the train through to a certain station,\" she added.\"But nothing beats travelling on an actual train. I like sitting by the window and watching the countryside roll by.\" Her family contacted GWR to see if they could help fulfil her wish and Billy White, station manager for the North Cotswolds, said it was a pleasure to to make one of her dreams come true.Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
