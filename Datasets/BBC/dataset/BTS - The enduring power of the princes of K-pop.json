  "text": "K-pop has been the driving force of Korean popular culture for more than two decades and one band is now leading the way. But, as the BBC's Heather Chen and BBC Korean's Minji Lee write, can BTS keep up their extraordinary rise in 2018?It's big business across Asia, contributing billions of dollars annually to the South Korean economy, but has yet to make a significant impact on Western markets. While pop star Psy found massive chart success with his 2012 dance hit Gangnam Style, his star soon fizzled.But come 2017 and enter BTS, the seven-piece boyband who last year managed to go where no K-pop act had gone before by conquering a notoriously difficult and unforgiving market: the US. A highly successful US tour propelled their musical combination of pop, hip-hop and R&B - mostly in Korean - on to the global stage.They had the highest charting album ever by a K-pop act on the Billboard 200 charts and in November, became the first K-pop act to top the US iTunes chart.Add that to their Billboard Music Award win in May, where fans voted them Top Social Artist, beating the likes of Justin Bieber. The boys wrapped up a milestone year by making social media history too. On Twitter, they received several honours which included \"most engagements for a music act\" and their very own emoji, and they were named the year's most retweeted artist.The US embassy in Seoul even revealed that their tweet with the highest engagement in 2017 was about BTS. That's appropriate for a band whose success has been driven by their meticulously maintained social media presence, winning them fiercely devoted fans who call themselves the ARMY.This article contains content provided by Instagram.

The style of communication therefore comes across as being too formal.\"However this isn't the case of BTS, who are managed by a relatively small agency. The boys are granted freedom in interacting with their fans on social media and are not treated as just being part of a huge system but rather, like actual human beings.\" Read more: Who are BTS and why are they so important?Yes, according to Mr Kim, because they are still offering something new. This video can not be played'Flat-chested' K-pop star responds to 'cruel' body comments\"BTS is different from Psy who had one good song but didn't maintain a consistent style afterwards,\" said Kim Hern-sik. \"BTS consistently and continuously built up a musical identity that really resonates with teens.\" He says they transformed the way that Korean celebrities - previously seen as perfect and far-removed from ordinary life - should be networking in order to build loyal fan bases. \"Ultimately, they are really successful because they know how to interact with their fans and I think their popularity is here to stay.\" Business observers like Singapore-based branding strategist Martin Roll agree. He says the \"hallyu wave\" - the explosion of Korean popular culture - \"has proven to be a blessing for Korea and is definitely here to stay\". \"The past decades are evidence that K-pop is no longer just a passing fad, but BTS needs to constantly think of novel ways to engage their fans in order to sustain their position at the top of the Korean entertainment industry,\" he told the BBC.
