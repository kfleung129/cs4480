The 29-year-old posted a picture of his freshly-shaven head on Instagram before being driven to the city of Wonju to take part in the military enlistment ceremony on Tuesday. The caption said: \"I'll have a good trip!\"The post racked up almost eight million likes from the Army - the name of BTS's fanbase. Many shared messages of encouragement and support.The band also posted a final picture all together, with Jin joining in his military uniform.Some fans turned up to the area of the army base, according to news agency Yonhap. Others rented a bus covered in pictures of J-Hope which was parked close by. Questions were raised for years over whether BTS would be forced to undertake the mandatory service, and whether their contribution to the arts should make them exempt. However, in 2019 the Ministry of Defence ruled that they would have to serve.",
