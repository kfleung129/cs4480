The cause of her death is still being investigated, but fans and fellow K-pop stars have been paying tribute to the star online.Sulli, who had more than five million followers on Instagram, was a member of f(x) until she left in 2015 to focus on her acting career. Some believe the artist, whose real name is Choi Jin-ri, suspended her K-pop work after struggling with the abuse she got online.Police have said they believe Sulli may have taken her own life but are investigating all possibilities. Music journalist Taylor Glasby said Sulli was a \"free spirit\". \"She was one of the idols who decided to live her life in the way she wanted to and that didn't always sit well with the general public,\" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.In South Korea, pop stars are called idols.\"For idols, everything is about appearance, everything is quite monitored and she just didn't [monitor her content]. She was herself\".\"She clapped back and she wouldn't take people's narrow-mindedness\".Taylor says Sulli's former band f(x) changed K-pop.\"They were one of the girl groups that didn't fit in, they did their own thing. Their music was more hard-hitting. It was innovative and complex, and it helped cement an entire sub-genre within K-pop - girl crush.\"When she left, her legacy became being outspoken. It became taking control of her own image. I admired her spirit to do so despite the constant negativity that was directed at her by some less open minded citizens.\"\u200eSulli's former f(x) bandmate, Amber Liu, has posted her shock at what's happened.This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She unashamedly told her fans that they had a choice about \u200ehow to display their bodies. \u200eShe was involved in the so-called \"no bra\" movement in South Korea - where women go braless to make a statement about expectations and judgement of their bodies.Sulli showed her nipples on social media on a number of \u200eoccasions - the first appeared on her Instagram account in May 2016. She faced a huge \u200eamount of abuse in response. Last month her breasts were shown by accident during a live \u200eInstagram stream - which again caused controversy in conservative South Korea.
