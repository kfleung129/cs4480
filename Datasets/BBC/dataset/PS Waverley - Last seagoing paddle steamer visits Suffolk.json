Built in 1946, the ship has carried passengers since its maiden voyage to Lochgoilhead and Arrochar in 1947. PS Waverley, which can carry up to 700 passengers, also visited Ipswich on Saturday for the first time since 2020.A spokesperson for Waverley Excursions said: \"We are thrilled to see such overwhelming support for Waverley's cruise from Southwold.\"The boat now contains eateries and bars, as well as a souvenir shop. PS Waverley is owned by the Paddle Steamer Preservation Society, which was gifted the ship for \u00a31 in 1974.Due to necessary boiler upgrades, the Waverley saw a short withdrawal from service about three years ago.
