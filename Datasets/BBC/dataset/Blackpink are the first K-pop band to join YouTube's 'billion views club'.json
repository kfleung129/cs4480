Their debut album Square One was released in 2016 and gave them their first number one single in their homeland, with the track Whistle.Earlier this year, they became the first K-pop girl band to perform a set at the Coachella music festival, and they have collaborated with Dua Lipa on the single Kiss And Make Up.Blackpink are also the most-subscribed music group on YouTube, amassing 31.2 million followers, who call themselves \"Blinks\". The band's name is meant to challenge female stereotypes. \"Pink is commonly used to portray prettiness, but BlackPink actually means to say 'Pretty isn't everything,'\" YG Entertainment explained when the band launched.\"It also symbolises that they are a team that encompasses not only beauty, but also great talent\".This video can not be playedBlackpink: Meet the K-pop superstars backstage at their first UK tourFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
