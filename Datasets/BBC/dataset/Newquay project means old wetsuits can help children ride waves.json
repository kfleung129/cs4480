The Wave Project, which is working with recycling firm SUEZ and Cornwall Council, said it is estimated that 380 tonnes of wetsuits are thrown away every year in the UK.Wave Project founder Joe Taylor, said he was \"super excited\" by the project which he said would lead to \"positive benefits for people and planet\".Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
